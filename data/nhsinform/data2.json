[{"data": {"text": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta \u2013 the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body.\nThe abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide \u2013 roughly the width of a garden hose. However, it can swell to over 5.5cm \u2013 what doctors class as a large AAA.\nLarge aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. If a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal.\nThe bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. Although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm.\nAAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group.\nThis is why all men are invited for a\u00a0screening test when they turn 65. The test involves a simple ultrasound scan, which takes around 10-15 minutes.\nSymptoms of an AAA\nIn most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their\u00a0abdomen (tummy)\u00a0or persistent back pain.\nAn AAA doesn\u2019t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there\u2019s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture).\nA ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive surgery.\nThe most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen.\nIf you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\nRead more about the symptoms of an AAA.\nCauses of an AAA\nIt's not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.\nThere are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level.\nHaving a family history of aortic aneurysms also means that you have an increased risk of developing one yourself.\nRead more about the causes of an AAA.\nDiagnosing an AAA\nBecause AAAs usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination \u2013 for example, if a GP notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen.\nThe screening test is an\u00a0ultrasound scan,\u00a0which allows the size of your abdominal aorta to be measured on a monitor. This is also how an aneurysm will be diagnosed if your doctor suspects you have one.\nRead more about diagnosing an AAA.\nTreating an AAA\nIf a large AAA is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent\u00a0it rupturing.\nThis is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing.\nIf surgery is not advisable \u2013 or if you decide not to have it \u2013 there are a number of non-surgical treatments that can reduce the risk of an aneurysm rupturing.\nThey include medications to lower\u00a0your cholesterol and blood pressure, and quitting smoking.\nYou will also have the size of your aneurysm checked regularly with ultrasound scanning.\nRead more about treating AAAs.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent getting an aneurysm \u2013 or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing \u2013 is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as:\n\nsmoking\neating a high-fat diet\nnot exercising regularly\nbeing overweight or obese\n\nRead more about preventing aneurysms.\nScreening\nRead more about screening for an AAA.\n\n\nIn most cases, an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) will cause no symptoms, unless it becomes particularly large.\nSymptoms of an unruptured AAA may include:\n\na pulsating feeling in your stomach (abdomen), usually near your belly button, that's usually only noticeable when you touch it\npersistent back pain\npersistent abdominal pain\n\nIf you have any of the symptoms above, you should see your GP as soon as possible.\nRuptured AAA\nIf your aortic aneurysm ruptures, you will feel a sudden and severe pain in the middle or side of your abdomen. In men, the pain can also radiate down into the scrotum.\nOther symptoms include:\n\ndizziness\nsweaty and clammy skin\nrapid heartbeat (tachycardia)\nshortness of breath\nfeeling faint\nloss of consciousness\n\nMedical emergency\nA ruptured aortic aneurysm is a medical emergency, and it\u2019s important to get to hospital as soon as possible.\nAround 80% of people with a rupture die before they reach hospital or don\u2019t survive emergency surgery.\nThis is why the\u00a0NHS AAA Screening Programme was introduced, so dangerously large aneurysms can be treated before they burst.\nIf you suspect that you or someone in your care has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.\n\n\nThe aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It transports oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs when part of the aorta wall becomes weakened and the large amount of blood that passes through it puts pressure on the weak spot, causing it to bulge outwards to form an aneurysm.\nThe abdominal aorta is usually around 2cm wide \u2013 about the width of a garden hosepipe \u00a0\u2013 but can swell to over 5.5cm, which is what doctors classify as a large aneurysm.\nRisk factors for an AAA\nIt's not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.\nOne study found that people aged over 75 are seven times more likely to be diagnosed with an AAA than people under 55 years old.\nMen are around six times more likely to be diagnosed with an AAA than women.\nHowever, there are other risk factors that you can do something about \u2013 described below \u2013 the most important of which is smoking.\nResearch has found that smokers are seven times more likely to develop an AAA than people who have never smoked.\nThe more you smoke, the greater your risk of developing an AAA. People who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers.\nThe risk may increase because tobacco smoke contains harmful substances that can damage and weaken the wall of the aorta.\nAtherosclerosis\u00a0is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged up by fatty deposits, such as cholesterol.\nAn AAA is thought to develop because these deposits (called plaques) cause the aorta to widen in an attempt to keep blood flowing through it. As it widens, it also gets weaker.\nSmoking, eating a high-fat diet and high blood pressure all increase your risk of developing atherosclerosis.\nAs well as contributing to atherosclerosis,\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension) can place increased pressure on the aorta's wall.\nHaving a family history of AAAs means that you have an increased risk of developing one.\nOne study found that people who had a brother or sister with an AAA were eight times more likely to develop one than people whose siblings were unaffected.\nThis suggests that certain genes you inherit from your parents may make you more vulnerable to developing an AAA.\nHowever, no specific genes have yet been identified.\nRead about how to reduce your risk of developing an AAA.\n\n\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) usually causes no symptoms. Therefore, they tend to be diagnosed as a result of screening, or during a routine physical examination when a GP notices a distinctive pulsating sensation in your abdomen.\nA diagnosis can be confirmed using an ultrasound scan. Ultrasound can also determine the size of the aneurysm, which is an important factor in deciding on a course of treatment.\nScreening\nAll men in the UK who are 65 or over are offered an\u00a0ultrasound scan to check for AAAs.\nAll men should receive an invitation in the year they turn 65 years old. Men who are older than 65 can refer themselves for screening by contacting their local NHS AAA screening service.\nFor more information, visit our page on\u00a0AAA screening.\n\n\nTreatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) depends on several factors, including the aneurysm's size, your age and general health.\nIn general, if you have a large aneurysm (5.5cm or larger) you will be advised to have surgery, either to strengthen the swollen section of the aorta or to replace it with a piece of synthetic tubing.\nThis is because the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is usually greater than the risk of having it repaired.\u00a0\nIf you have a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you will be offered regular scans to check its size.\nYou will also be given advice on how to slow its growth and reduce the risk of it rupturing\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, stopping smoking \u2013 and perhaps medications to reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol level.\nIf you have a large AAA\nIf you are diagnosed with an AAA that is 5.5cm or larger, you will be referred to a vascular surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in diseases of the blood vessels), who may recommend an operation.\nThe surgeon will discuss treatment options with you, taking into account your general health and fitness, as well as the size of your aneurysm.\nIf it's decided that surgery isn\u2019t suitable for you, it\u2019s still possible to reduce the risk of the aneurysm bursting, and you will have regular scans to check its size \u2013 in the same way people with small or medium aneurysms are treated.\nSee below for more information on treating small and medium aneurysms.\nThere are two surgical techniques used to treat a large aneurysm:\n\nendovascular surgery\nopen surgery\n\nAlthough both techniques are equally effective at reducing the risk of the aneurysm bursting, each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nThe surgeon will discuss with you which is most suitable.\nEndovascular surgery is a type of \"keyhole\" surgery where the surgeon makes small cuts in your groin.\nA small piece of tubing called a graft\u2013 made of metal mesh lined with fabric \u2013 is then guided up through the leg artery, into the swollen section of aorta, and sealed to the wall of the aorta at both ends.\nThis reinforces the aorta, reducing the risk of it bursting.\nThis is the safest of the two types of surgery available. Around 98-99% of patients make a full recovery, and recovery time from the operation is shorter than if you have open surgery.\nThere are also fewer major complications, such as wound infection or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\u00a0\nHowever, the way the graft is attached is not as secure as open surgery. You\u2019ll need regular scans to make sure the graft hasn\u2019t slipped, and in some patients, the seal at each end of the graft starts to leak and will need to be resealed. You will need to have surgery again if either of these occurs.\nIn open surgery, the surgeon cuts into your stomach (abdomen) to reach the abdominal aorta and replaces the enlarged section with a graft.\nThis type of graft is a tube made of a synthetic material.\nBecause the graft is stitched (sutured) into place by the surgeon, it\u2019s more likely to stay in place, and will usually work well for the rest of your life.\nThe risk of complications linked to the graft after surgery is lower than in people who have endovascular surgery.\nOpen surgery isn\u2019t usually recommended for people who are in poor health as it is a major operation. It is slightly more risky than endovascular surgery, with 93-97% of patients making a full recovery.\nThe main risk of open surgery is death or heart attack, and recovery time is longer than with endovascular surgery.\nThere is also a greater risk of complications, such as wound infection, chest infection and DVT.\nIf you have a small or medium AAA\nIf you are diagnosed with a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you won\u2019t be referred to see a vascular surgeon, as it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019d benefit from surgery.\nYou\u2019ll be invited back for regular scans to check the size of the aneurysm, in case it gets bigger \u2013 every year if you have a small aneurysm and every three months if you have a medium aneurysm.\nYou will also be given advice on how to prevent the aneurysm from getting bigger, including:\n\nstopping smoking\neating a balanced diet\nensuring you maintain a healthy weight\ntaking regular exercise\n\nIf you smoke, the most important change you can make is to quit. Aneurysms have been shown to grow faster in smokers than in non-smokers.\nRead more about\u00a0stopping smoking and\u00a0nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) that can make it easier to stop smoking.\nYour GP will be sent your test result and may decide to change your current medication or start you on a new one, especially if you have:\n\nhigh blood pressure\u00a0\u2013 which you will probably be treated for with a medication called an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor\nhigh cholesterol\u00a0\u2013 which you will probably be treated for with a medication called a statin\n\nTreating a ruptured AAA\nEmergency treatment for a ruptured AAA is based on the same principle as preventative treatment. Grafts are used to repair the ruptured aneurysm.\nThe decision on whether to perform open or endovascular surgery is made on a case-by-case basis by the surgeon carrying out the operation.\n\n\nThe best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels.\nThis includes:\n\nsmoking\neating a high-fat diet\nnot exercising regularly\nbeing overweight or obese\n\nIf your GP finds out you have high blood pressure or a high cholesterol level, you may be prescribed medication for both. This will reduce the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).\nSmoking\nSmoking is a major risk factor for aneurysms because it causes atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and raises your blood pressure.\nTobacco smoke contains substances that can damage the walls of the arteries.\nIt is known that smokers are seven times more likely than non-smokers to develop an AAA.\u00a0\nThe more you smoke, the greater your risk. People who regularly smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day may have more than 10 times the risk of non-smokers.\nIf you want to stop smoking, your GP will be able to refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will give you dedicated help and advice about the best ways to quit.\nYou can also call or chat online with Quit Your Way Scotland.\u00a0The specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement.\nRead more about\u00a0stopping smoking and\u00a0nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs), which can make it easier to quit.\nDiet\nEating a high-fat diet increases your risk of atherosclerosis.\nIt\u2019s especially important to limit the amount of foods you eat that are high in saturated fat, such as biscuits, cakes, butter, sausages and bacon.\nThis is because eating too much saturated fat can lead to high cholesterol, which can build up in the artery walls.\nRead more about high cholesterol. Find out more about\u00a0healthy eating and how to reduce the amount of saturated fat you eat.\nExercise\nBeing active and doing regular exercise lowers blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.\nRegular exercise can also help you lose weight, which will also help lower your blood pressure.\nAdults should do at least 150 minutes (two hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week.\nExamples of moderate intensity activity include cycling or fast walking.\nFor it to count, the activity should make you feel warm and slightly out of breath. Someone who is overweight may only have to walk up a slope to get this feeling.\nPhysical activity can include anything from sport to walking and gardening.\nGet more ideas on being active.\nWeight\nBeing overweight forces your heart to work harder to pump blood around your body. This can raise your blood pressure, which in turn puts pressure on your arteries.\nUse a\u00a0BMI healthy weight calculator to find out if you need to lose weight.\nIf you need to shed some weight, it's worth remembering that losing just a few pounds will make a big difference to your blood pressure and overall health.\nGet tips on losing weight safely\u00a0and read more about preventing high blood pressure.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch.\nAcne most commonly develops on the:\n\nface \u2013 this affects almost everyone with acne\nback \u2013 this affects\u00a0more than\u00a0half of people with acne\nchest \u2013 this affects\u00a0about 15% of\u00a0people with acne\n\nTypes of spots\nThere are 6\u00a0main types of spot caused by acne:\n\nblackheads \u2013\u00a0small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin;\u00a0they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring)\nwhiteheads \u2013 have a similar appearance to blackheads, but\u00a0may be firmer and won't empty when squeezed\npapules \u2013\u00a0small red bumps that may feel tender or sore\npustules \u2013\u00a0similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus\nnodules \u2013\u00a0large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be\u00a0painful\ncysts \u2013\u00a0the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils\u00a0and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring\n\nWhat can I do if I have acne?\nThe self-help techniques below may be useful:\n\nDon't wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse\nWash the affected area with\u00a0a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse\nDon't try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots.\u00a0This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring\nAvoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin)\nCompletely remove make-up before going to bed\nIf dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient\nRegular exercise can't improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem.\u00a0Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne\nWash your hair regularly\u00a0and try to avoid letting\u00a0your hair fall across your face\n\nAlthough acne can't be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. Several creams, lotions and gels\u00a0for treating spots are available at pharmacies. If you develop acne, it's a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice.\u00a0\nTreatments can take up to 3\u00a0months to work, so don't expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good.\nWhen to get professional advice\nIf you have acne you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory.\nAcne isn't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back,\u00a0it may need to be treated with\u00a0antibiotics\u00a0or stronger creams that are only\u00a0available on prescription. Your pharmacist can advise on whether you need to see your GP for further treatment.\nIf you develop nodules or cysts, they need to be treated properly through your GP to avoid scarring.\u00a0Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring.\nWhy do I have acne?\nAcne is most commonly\u00a0linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age.\nCertain hormones cause\u00a0the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).\nThis abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.\nThe hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn't help to remove this blockage.\nAcne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne.\nHormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.\nThere's no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of acne,\u00a0including some common acne myths.\nWho's affected?\nAcne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11\u00a0to 30\u00a0are affected by acne.\nAcne is most common in girls from the ages of 14\u00a0to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16\u00a0to 19.\nMost people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties.\nIn some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About\u00a05% of\u00a0women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25.\nFurther information\nYou can find support and information from organisations like:\n\nChanging Faces \u2013 a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice\n\n\n\nAcne is caused when tiny holes in the skin, known as hair follicles, become blocked.\nSebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of your skin. The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of.\nSebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum.\nIn acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle.\nIf the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead.\nNormally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts.\nTestosterone\u00a0\nTeenage acne\u00a0is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. The hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls.\nThe sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones.\u00a0It's thought that increased levels of\u00a0testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs.\nAcne in families\nAcne\u00a0can run in families. If your parents had acne, it's likely that you'll also develop it.\nOne study has found that if both your parents had acne, you're more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. It also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you're more likely to get adult acne too.\nAcne in women\nMore than\u00a080% of\u00a0cases of adult acne\u00a0occur in women. It's thought that many cases of adult acne are\u00a0caused by\u00a0the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times.\nThese times\u00a0include:\n\nperiods\u00a0\u2013 some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period\npregnancy\u00a0\u2013 many women have symptoms of acne at this time, usually during the first 3\u00a0months of their pregnancy\npolycystic ovary syndrome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovary\n\nOther triggers\nOther possible triggers of an acne flare-up include:\n\nsome cosmetic products\u00a0\u2013\u00a0however, this is less common as most products are now tested,\u00a0so they don't cause spots\u00a0(non-comedogenic)\ncertain medications\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as steroid medications, lithium\u00a0(used to treat\u00a0depression and bipolar disorder) and\u00a0some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treat\u00a0epilepsy)\nregularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as\u00a0a headband or backpack\nsmoking\u00a0\u2013 which can contribute to acne in older people\n\nAcne myths\nDespite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood.\u00a0There are\u00a0many myths and misconceptions about it:\nSo far, research hasn't found any foods that cause acne. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended because it's good for your heart and your health in general.\nMost of the biological reactions that trigger acne occur beneath the skin, not on the surface, so\u00a0the cleanliness of your skin\u00a0has\u00a0no effect on your acne. Washing your face more than twice a day could just aggravate your skin.\nThis could actually make symptoms worse and may leave you with scarring.\nHaving sex or masturbating won't make acne any better or worse.\nThere's no conclusive evidence that prolonged exposure to sunlight or using sunbeds or sunlamps can improve acne. Many medications used to treat acne can make your skin more sensitive to light, so exposure could cause painful damage to your skin, and also increase your risk of skin cancer.\nYou can't pass acne on to other people.\n\n\nYour pharmacist can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. This involves examining your face and possibly your chest and back for different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules.\nHow many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. This is\u00a0important in planning your treatment.\n4\u00a0grades can be used to measure the severity of acne:\n\ngrade 1 (mild) \u2013 acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules\ngrade 2 (moderate) \u2013 there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face\ngrade 3 (moderately severe) \u2013 there's a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne\ngrade 4 (severe) \u2013 there's a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules\n\nAcne in women\nIf acne suddenly starts\u00a0in adult women, it\u00a0can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms such as:\n\nexcessive body hair (hirsutism)\nirregular or light periods\n\nThe most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is\u00a0polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can be diagnosed using a combination of\u00a0ultrasound scans and blood tests.\n\n\nTreatment for acne depends on how severe it is. It can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve.\nThe various treatments for acne are outlined below.\nIf you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide.\nTreatments from your GP\nSee your GP if your acne is more widespread,\u00a0as you probably need prescription medication.\u00a0For example, if:\n\nyou have a large number of papules and pustules\nover-the-counter medication hasn't worked\n\nPrescription medications that can be used to treat acne include:\n\ntopical retinoids\ntopical\u00a0antibiotics\nazelaic acid\nantibiotic tablets\nin women, the combined oral contraceptive pill\nisotretinoin tablets\n\nIf you have severe acne,\u00a0your GP can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). For example, if you have:\n\na large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face\npainful nodules\n\nA combination of\u00a0antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. If this doesn't work, a medication called\u00a0isotretinoin may be prescribed.\nHormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. However, the\u00a0progestogen-only pill or\u00a0contraceptive implant can sometimes make acne worse.\nMany of these treatments can take 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0months before they start to work. It's important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if\u00a0there's no immediate effect.\nTopical treatments (gels, creams and lotions)\nBenzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect.\nBenzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It's used either once or twice a day. It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne.\nIt should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream.\nBenzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or\u00a0clothes.\nCommon side effects of benzoyl peroxide include:\n\ndry and tense skin\na burning, itching or stinging sensation\nsome redness and peeling of the skin\n\nSide effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished.\nMost people need a 6 week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. You may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning.\nTopical retinoids work by\u00a0removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating)\u00a0which helps\u00a0to prevent them building up within hair follicles.\nTretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They're available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed.\nApply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face.\nIt's important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV.\nTopical retinoids aren't suitable for use during pregnancy, as there's a risk they might cause birth defects.\nThe most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin.\nA 6 week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this.\nTopical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. They're available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day.\nA 6 to 8\u00a0week course is usually recommended. After this, treatment is usually stopped, as there's a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics. This could make your acne worse and cause additional infections.\nSide effects are uncommon, but can include:\n\nminor irritation of the skin\nredness and burning of the skin\npeeling of the skin\n\nAzelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful.\nAzelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It's available\u00a0as a\u00a0cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive).\nThe medication doesn't make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don't have to avoid exposure to the sun.\nYou'll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves.\nThe side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include:\n\nburning or stinging skin\nitchiness\ndry skin\nredness of the skin\n\nAntibiotic tablets\nAntibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne.\nIn most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you're pregnant or breastfeeding.\nPregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use.\nIt usually takes about 6\u00a0weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne.\nDepending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0months.\nTetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and UV light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment.\nYou'll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, during this time.\nHormonal therapies\nHormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around\u00a0periods or\u00a0is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome.\nIf you don't already use it, your GP may recommend the combined oral contraceptive pill, even if you're not sexually active. This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen.\nCo-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne\u00a0that doesn't respond to antibiotics. It helps to reduce the production of sebum.\nYou'll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for 2\u00a0to 6\u00a0months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne.\nThere's a small risk\u00a0that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop breast cancer in later life.\nFor example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven't taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least 5\u00a0years in their early twenties.\nThere's also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk\u00a0is\u00a0estimated to\u00a0be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year.\nIt's not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.\u00a0Women may need to have a pregnancy test before treatment can begin.\nOther side effects of co-cyprindiol include:\n\nbleeding and spotting between your periods, which\u00a0can sometimes occur for the first few months\nheadaches\nsore breasts\nmood changes\nloss of interest in sex\nweight gain or weight loss\n\nIsotretinoin\nIsotretinoin\u00a0has a number of beneficial effects:\n\nit helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is\u00a0produced\nit helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged\nit decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin\nit reduces redness and swelling in and around spots\n\nHowever,\u00a0the drug\u00a0can also cause a wide range of side effects. It's only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven't responded to other treatments.\nBecause of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a\u00a0dermatologist.\nIsotretinoin is taken\u00a0as a\u00a0tablet. Most people take a 4\u00a0to 6 month course. Your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. However, this is normal and soon settles.\nCommon side effects of isotretinoin include:\n\ninflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils\nchanges in your blood sugar levels\ninflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis)\ninflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis)\nblood in your urine\n\nRarer side effects of isotretinoin include:\n\ninflammation of the liver (hepatitis)\ninflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\nkidney disease\n\nBecause of the risk of these rarer side effects, you'll need a\u00a0blood test before and during treatment.\nIsotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. If you're a woman of childbearing age:\n\ndon't use isotretinoin if you're\u00a0pregnant or you think you're pregnant\nuse 1, or ideally 2, methods of contraception for 1\u00a0month before treatment begins, during treatment and for 1\u00a0month after treatment has finished\nhave a pregnancy test before, during and after treatment\n\nYou'll be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you're not currently sexually active.\nIf you think you may\u00a0have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately.\nIsotretinoin is also not suitable if you're breastfeeding.\nThere have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. There's no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication.\nHowever, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts.\nNon-pharmaceutical treatments\nSeveral treatments for acne don't involve medication.\nThese include:\n\ncomedone extractor \u2013 a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads\nchemical peels \u2013 where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it\nphotodynamic therapy \u2013 where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne\n\nHowever, these treatments may not work and can't be routinely recommended.\n\n\nAcne scarring can sometimes develop as a complication of acne. Any type of acne spot can lead to scarring, but it's more common when the most serious types of spots (nodules and cysts) burst and damage nearby skin.\nScarring\u00a0can also occur if you pick or squeeze your spots, so it's important not to do this.\nThere are 3\u00a0main types of acne scars:\n\nice pick scars \u2013 small, deep holes in the surface of your skin that look like the skin has been punctured with a sharp object\nrolling scars \u2013 caused by bands of scar tissue that form under the skin, giving the surface of the skin a rolling and uneven appearance\nboxcar scars \u2013 round or oval depressions, or craters, in the skin\n\nTreating acne scarring\nTreatments for acne scarring are regarded as a type of cosmetic surgery, which isn't usually available on the NHS. However, in the past, exceptions have been made when it's been shown that acne scarring has caused serious psychological distress.\nSee your GP if you're considering having cosmetic surgery. They'll be able to discuss your options with you and advise you about the likelihood of having the procedure carried out on the NHS.\nMany private clinics offer treatment for acne scarring. Prices can vary widely (from \u00a3500 to\u00a0more than\u00a0\u00a310,000) depending on the type of treatment needed.\nThe British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons website has more information about private treatment available in your area.\nIt's important to have realistic expectations about what cosmetic treatment can achieve. While treatment can certainly improve the appearance of your scars, it can't get rid of them completely.\nAfter treatment for acne scarring, most people notice a 50-75% improvement in their appearance.\nSome of the available treatments for acne scarring are explained below.\nDermabrasion involves removing the top layer of skin, either using lasers or a specially made wire brush.\nAfter the procedure, your skin will look red and sore for several months, but as it heals you should notice an improvement in the appearance of your scars.\nLaser treatment can be used to treat mild to moderate acne scarring. There are 2\u00a0types of laser treatment:\n\nablative laser treatment \u2013 where lasers are used to remove a small patch of skin around the scar to produce a new, smooth-looking area of skin\nnon-ablative laser treatment \u2013 where lasers are used to stimulate the growth of new collagen (a type of protein found in skin), which helps to repair some of the damage caused by scarring, and improves the appearance\n\nPunch techniques are used to treat ice pick scars and boxcar scars. There are 3\u00a0types of punch technique:\n\npunch excision \u2013\u00a0used to treat mild ice pick scars. The scar is surgically removed and the remaining wound is sealed. After the wound heals, it leaves a smoother and more even area of skin.\npunch elevation \u2013\u00a0used to treat boxcar scars. The base of the scar is surgically removed, leaving the sides of the scar in place. The base is then reattached to the sides, but lifted up so it's level with the surface of the skin. This makes the scar much less noticeable.\npunch grafting \u2013\u00a0used to treat very deep ice pick scars. As with a punch excision, the scar is removed, but the wound is \"plugged\" with a sample of skin taken from elsewhere on the body (usually from the back of the ear).\n\nSubcision is a surgical treatment that can be used to treat rolling scars. During surgery, the upper layer of the skin is removed from the underlying scar tissue. This allows blood to pool under the affected area. The blood clot helps form connective tissue, which pushes up the rolling scar so it's level with the rest of the surface of the skin.\nOnce subscision has been completed, additional treatment, such as laser treatment and dermabrasion, can be used to further improve the appearance of the scar.\nDepression\nAcne can often cause intense feelings of anxiety and stress, which can sometimes make people with the condition become socially withdrawn. This combination of factors can lead to people with acne becoming depressed.\nYou may be depressed if during the last month you've often felt down, depressed or hopeless, and have little interest or pleasure in doing things.\nIf you think that you or your child may have depression, it's important to speak to your GP.\nTreatments for depression include:\n\ntalking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\na type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n\nRead more about treatment\u00a0for depression.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means the condition progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.\nAcute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. There are 2 main types:\n\nlymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections\nneutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\u00a0\n\nThese pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:\n\nchronic lymphocytic leukaemia\nchronic myeloid leukaemia\nacute myeloid leukaemia\n\nWarning signs of acute leukaemia\nSymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\u00a0usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases. Symptoms\u00a0include:\n\npale skin\ntiredness\nbreathlessness\nhaving repeated infections over a short space of time\nunusual and frequent bleeding\n\nRead more about the symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nWhat happens in acute leukaemia\nAll of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow \u2013 a spongy material found inside bones.\nBone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells:\n\nred blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body\nwhite blood cells, which help fight infection\nplatelets, which help stop bleeding\n\nThe bone marrow usually produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. But in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells.\nAs the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. This drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding.\nAlso, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nDespite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children.\nThe cause or causes of acute leukaemia are uncertain, but known risk factors include:\n\nexposure to high levels of radiation\nexposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettes\n\nRead more information about the causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\n\n\nSymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases.\nMost of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply.\nSymptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include:\n\npale skin\nfeeling tired and breathless\nhaving repeated infections over a short space of time\nunusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds\nhigh temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\nnight sweats\nbone and joint pain\neasily bruised skin\nswollen lymph nodes (glands)\nabdominal pain \u2013 caused by a swollen liver or spleen\nunexplained weight loss\u00a0\na purple skin rash (purpura)\n\nIn some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. This can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including:\n\nheadaches\nseizures (fits)\nvomiting\nblurred vision\ndizziness\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you or your child has some or even all of these symptoms, it is still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause.\nHowever, see your GP as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs to be promptly investigated and treated.\n\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells causing too many white blood cells to be produced.\nThe white blood cells\u00a0are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature\u00a0and able to fight infection like fully developed white blood cells.\nAs the number of immature cells increases,\u00a0the number of\u00a0healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it's this\u00a0fall\u00a0which causes many of the\u00a0symptoms of leukaemia.\nIt is not known exactly what causes this DNA mutation to occur, but there are\u00a0a few\u00a0factors which may increase the\u00a0risk of\u00a0developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\nRisk factors\nA small number\u00a0of childhood acute lymphoblastic\u00a0leukaemia cases are thought to be caused by related genetic disorders. For example, rates of leukaemia tend to be higher in children with Down\u2019s syndrome.\nExposure to very high levels of radiation, either before birth or afterwards, is a known risk factor. However, it would require a significant level of radiation, such as the amount released during the nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl.\nDue to the potential risk of radiation to unborn babies, medical techniques and equipment that use radiation, such as X-rays, are rarely used on pregnant women.\nMost cases of childhood leukaemia occur in children with no history of genetic disorders or exposure to radiation.\nExperts have also carried out extensive research to determine whether the following environmental factors could be a trigger for leukaemia:\n\nliving near a nuclear power station\nliving near a power line\nliving near a building or facility that releases electromagnetic radiation, such as a mobile phone mast\n\nAt the moment there is no evidence to confirm that any of these environmental factors increase the risk of developing leukaemia.\nExposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for adult acute leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry. However, there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.\nBenzene is also found in cigarettes, which could explain why smokers are three times more likely to develop acute leukaemia than non-smokers. People who have had chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat earlier, unrelated cancers also have an increased risk of developing acute leukaemia.\nThere is some evidence to show an increased risk of\u00a0acute lymphoblastic\u00a0leukaemia in people who:\n\nare obese\nhave a weakened immune system \u2013 due to HIV or AIDS or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant\n\n\n\nThe first step in diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is for your GP to check for physical signs of the condition, such as swollen glands, and to take a blood sample.\nA high number of abnormal white blood cells in the blood sample could indicate the presence of acute leukaemia and you will then be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).\nBone marrow biopsy\nTo confirm a diagnosis of acute leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope.\nThe haematologist will use a local anaesthetic to numb the skin over a bone \u2013 usually the hip bone \u2013 and then use a needle to remove a sample of bone marrow. You may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight.\nThe bone marrow will be checked for cancerous cells and \u2013 if found \u2013 the type of acute leukaemia will be determined at the same time.\nFurther tests\nThere are various additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. They can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. These tests are described below.\nCytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. There are specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia, and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment.\nImmunophenotyping is a test to help identify the exact type of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A sample of blood, bone marrow or another type of fluid is studied.\nThis testing is important as the treatment needed may be slightly different for each type.\nA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be done on a blood sample. This is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment.\nThe blood test is repeated every three months for at least two years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved.\nIf you have been diagnosed with acute leukaemia, further biopsies may be carried out on any enlarged lymph nodes that you have. These will be able to establish how far the leukaemia has spread.\nIf you have acute leukaemia, a computerised tomography scan (CT scan) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy.\nAn\u00a0X-ray\u00a0may be performed to examine the chest for any swollen lymph nodes.\nIf it is felt that there is a risk that acute leukaemia has spread to your nervous system, a lumbar puncture may be carried out.\nA lumbar puncture is a test where a needle is used under local anaesthetic to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and protects your spine) from your back. The fluid is tested to determine whether the leukaemia has reached your nervous system.\n\n\nTreatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begins a few days after diagnosis as it's an aggressive condition that develops rapidly.\nStages of treatment\nTreatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is carried out in stages:\n\ninduction \u2013 the aim of the initial stage of treatment is to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood\u00a0and resolve any symptoms you may have\nconsolidation \u2013 this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system\nmaintenance \u2013 the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returning\n\nMaintenance only seems to be effective in treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; it's not usually used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia.\nInduction\nThe induction stage of treatment is carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre. This is because you will probably need to have regular\u00a0blood transfusions as it's likely that your blood will not contain enough healthy blood cells.\nYou will also be vulnerable to infection, so it is important that you are in a sterile environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection that you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed\u00a0antibiotics to help prevent further infection.\nYou will be given\u00a0chemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow. Although some medications may be given as pills, you will need more than one medication given as an injection. To make things easier and avoid repeated injections, they can all be given via one flexible tube\u00a0into a vein in your chest (called a central line).\nSome chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This\u00a0is given using a needle that is placed into your spine, in a similar way to a\u00a0lumbar puncture.\nSide effects that occur following chemotherapy are common. They can include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\nloss of appetite\nmouth ulcers\ntiredness\nskin rashes\ninfertility\nhair loss\n\nThe side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Your hair will usually take between three to six months to grow back.\nYou may also be given\u00a0corticosteroid injections or tablets to help improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy.\nIf you have a type of leukaemia known as Philadelphia chromosome-positive\u00a0acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, you will also be given a medicine called imatinib. Imatinib works by blocking the signals in the cancerous cells that cause them to grow and reproduce. This kills the cancerous cells.\nImatinib is taken orally (as a tablet). The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve over time. They include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\nswelling in the face and lower legs\nmuscle cramps\nrash\ndiarrhoea\n\nDepending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from two weeks to several months. In some cases, you or your child may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve.\nConsolidation\nLeukaemia can return if just one cancerous cell remains in your body. Therefore the aim of consolidation treatment is to ensure that any remaining leukaemia cells are killed.\nTreatment involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication. This is usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may require some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection.\nThe consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.\nMaintenance\nThe maintenance phase is designed to act as further insurance against the possibility of the leukaemia returning. It involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets while undergoing regular check-ups to monitor how effective your treatment is proving.\nThe maintenance phase can often last for two years.\nOther treatments\nAs well as chemotherapy and imatinib, other treatments are used in some circumstances. These are described below.\u00a0\nDasatinib is a new type of medication used to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, when all other treatments have proved unsuccessful.\nDasatinib blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase that helps stimulate the growth of cancer cells.\nDasatinib cannot cure acute leukaemia but it can slow its growth, helping to relieve symptoms and prolong life.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has not yet made a decision about whether the NHS should provide treatment with dasatinib for people with acute lymphoblastic\u00a0leukaemia. This means it will be at the discretion of your local\u00a0clinical commissioning group\u00a0as to whether you will be offered the drug.\nRadiotherapy\u00a0involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. There are two main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat acute leukaemia:\n\nto sometimes treat advanced cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that have spread to the nervous system or brain\nto prepare the body for a bone marrow transplant (see below)\n\nSide effects of both types of radiotherapy include:\n\nhair loss\nnausea\nfatigue\n\nThe side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed. However, your skin may be very sensitive to the effects of light for several months after the treatment has finished. If this is the case, avoid sunbathing or exposure to sources of artificial light, such as sunbeds, for several months.\nMany younger children treated with radiotherapy will go on to have restricted physical growth during puberty.\nA small number of people develop cataracts several years after radiotherapy. Cataracts are cloudy patches in the lens (the transparent structure at the front of the eye) that can make your vision blurred or misty. Cataracts can usually be successfully treated using surgery.\nRead more about cataracts\u00a0\nIf you or your child do not respond to chemotherapy, a possible alternative treatment option is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.\nTransplantations are more successful if the donor has the same tissue type as you, so the ideal donor is usually a brother or sister.\nBefore transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have aggressive high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body.\nThis can put a big\u00a0strain on the body\u00a0so transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people who are in good health, and when there is a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister.\nRead\u00a0about bone marrow transplantation for more information\n\n\nBeing immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with acute leukaemia.\nThere are 2 reasons for this:\n\nthe lack of healthy white blood cells means that your immune system is less able to fight infection\nmany of the medicines used to treat\u00a0acute leukaemia\u00a0can weaken the immune system\n\nThis means that\u00a0you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications.\nYou may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections occurring. You should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or\u00a0care team\u00a0because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications.\nSymptoms of infection include:\n\nhigh temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above\nheadache\naching muscles\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\n\nAvoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be lower.\nWhile it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour.\nAlso ensure that all of your\u00a0vaccinations are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You will be unable to have any vaccine containing activated particles of viruses of bacteria such as:\n\nthe\u00a0mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine\nthe polio vaccine\nthe oral typhoid vaccine\nthe BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis)\nthe yellow fever vaccine\n\nBleeding\nIf you have acute leukaemia, you will bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive when it does occur.\nBleeding can occur:\n\ninside the skull (intracranial haemorrhage)\ninside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage)\ninside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage)\n\nThe symptoms of an intracranial haemorrhage include:\n\nsevere headache\nstiff neck\nvomiting\nchange in mental state, such as confusion\n\nThe most common symptoms of a pulmonary haemorrhage are:\n\ncoughing up blood from your nose and mouth\nbreathing difficulties\na bluish skin tone (cyanosis)\n\nThe 2 most common symptoms of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage are:\n\nvomiting blood\npassing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like\n\nAll 3 types of haemorrhages should be regarded as medical emergencies. Phone 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you or your child is experiencing a haemorrhage.\nInfertility\nMany of the treatments that are used to treat acute leukaemia can cause infertility. Infertility is often temporary, although in some cases it may be permanent.\nPeople who are particularly at risk of becoming infertile are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in preparation for bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.\nIt may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. For example, men can have samples of their sperm stored. Similarly, women can have fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb following treatment.\nRead more about\u00a0infertility\nPsychological effects of leukaemia\nReceiving a diagnosis of leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. At first, the news may be difficult to take in.\nThe situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. Having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of stress, anxiety and depression.\nIf you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition.\nYou may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups.\nAnother excellent resource is Macmillan Cancer Support. Their helpline number is\u00a00808 808 00 00\u00a0and is open Monday to Friday, 9am\u20138pm.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can read more information on all aspects of living and coping with cancer at the following links:\n\nliving with cancer \u2013 including information on treatment, support and personal experiences of cancer\nliving with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\u00a0\u2013 Cancer Research UK\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute myeloid leukaemia.\nIf you\u2019re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0ALL section.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.\u00a0Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn\u2019t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to:\n\nhelp fight infection (white cells)\u00a0\ncarry oxygen from the lungs around\u00a0the body (red blood cells)\u00a0\nstop cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)\n\nSymptoms\nMany of the symptoms of ALL are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:\n\nlooking paler than usual and feeling tired \u2013 because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)\nbruises\u00a0\u2013 you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal\ninfections \u2013 because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection\naches and pains in your bones\nswollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin\nfeeling unwell and run down\nfever and sweats \u2013 you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection\nheadaches and visual disturbance\n\nThere can be other reasons you may have these symptoms. But if you are worried that you may have ALL, you should speak to your GP. They'll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.\nCauses\nIt's not known exactly what causes ALL. Research is going on to try to find out.\nYoung people with some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are at an increased risk of developing ALL. A genetic condition is something you are born with.\nIf you're worried about ALL\u00a0\nIf you think you have some of the symptoms of ALL you should speak to your GP. They can talk to you about your symptoms and arrange any\u00a0tests they think you might need.\n\n\nTo understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.\u00a0\nAll blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. A type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs.\nThere are 3 main types of blood cells:\n\nwhite blood cells \u2013 which help fight infection\nred blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body\nplatelets \u2013 which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding\n\nThe bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. To begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they\u2019re immature).\nThe main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. They can\u2019t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. Blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they\u2019ve matured into fully-developed blood cells.\nOnce blood cells are mature, they\u2019re ready to do their jobs. They leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they\u2019re needed.\nHow leukaemia develops\nIn leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made.\nThey build up in the bone marrow until there isn\u2019t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.\nTypes of leukaemia\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Healthy white blood cells are made from two types of blood cells:\n\nlymphoblasts that make lymphocytes\nmyeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophils\n\nLeukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. The most common types in teenagers and young adults are AML and ALL:\n\nacute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells\nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblasts\n\nThere are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people.\nThe information in this section is about ALL, but if you have a different type of leukaemia and want to know more,\u00a0contact Macmillan.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms and causes of ALL\u00a0\nhaving tests for ALL\u00a0\nbeing treated for ALL\u00a0\n\nIf you're looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0ALL section.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the symptoms of ALL can be caused by lots of different things. But you should go to your GP if you\u2019re worried. They can talk to you about your symptoms and arrange any tests they think you might need.\nVisiting your GP\nYour GP will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. There can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you\u2019ll need a blood test to help diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). If you have ALL, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you'll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.\nThis specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood problems.\nAt the hospital\nThe haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. They will also arrange for you to have some more tests. These may include:\n\nblood tests\u00a0\u2013 you\u2019ll need more blood tests even if you\u2019ve had some already\u00a0to look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help\u00a0the doctors decide on the best treatment for you\nbone marrow test\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow\u00a0and get samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing\nlumbar puncture\u00a0\u2013 a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells\nchest X-ray\u00a0\u2013 this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest\n\nIf you have ALL, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. These could be blood tests, or an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, and an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart).\nThis may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment.\nWaiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them\u00a0\u2013 what will happen, how you'll feel and when you'll get the results \u2013 can help you cope. Thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. You could also talk to a Macmillan\u00a0cancer support specialist on\u00a0their free helpline.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms of ALL\u00a0\nbeing treated for ALL\u00a0\nleukaemia, blood cells and bone marrow\u00a0\n\nIf you're looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read\u00a0our general\u00a0ALL section.\n\n\nThe main treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is chemotherapy. This means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. You\u2019ll also have drugs called steroids, which help the chemotherapy to work.\nThe treatment for ALL is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. But you'll be in close contact with the hospital when you\u2019re most likely to feel unwell and the staff will be able to help if things get tough. Don\u2019t feel you have to be brave. Be honest about how you are feeling with your doctors and nurses. They can give you medicines that can help you feel better.\u00a0\u00a0\nALL is treated in\u00a03\u00a0phases:\n\ngetting rid of the leukaemia\u00a0\u2013 remission induction\nkeeping the leukaemia away\u00a0\u2013 consolidation and delayed intensification therapy\nkeeping the leukaemia away long-term\u00a0\u2013 continuing or maintenance therapy\n\nYou usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have ALL.\nYou'll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with.\u00a0If you're 18 or younger, you'll be treated in a specialist Principal Treatment Centre (PTC) for teenagers and young adults (TYA).\u00a0If you're 19 or older, you'll be offered the choice of having treatment at the PTC or another hospital closer to home called a TYA designated hospital.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll be given chemotherapy as tablets, by injection and into your bloodstream (intravenously). You\u2019ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around the spinal cord to make sure the leukaemia cells can\u2019t hide there. This is called central nervous system (CNS) therapy. It's also known as intrathecal therapy.\nYou\u2019ll have a \u2018line\u2019 put in to one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous treatment. Your nurses and doctors can also use the line to take blood samples for blood tests. There are different kinds of lines.\nHaving chemotherapy can be hard. But the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. And you\u2019ll be given medicines to stop you feeling sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections.\nThere will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you\u2019ll feel better. You might also feel upset, down or irritable. Talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings.\nBeing in hospital or coming up to hospital for clinics and treatment can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work, or on things your friends are doing. You could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you. It can also help to talk to any new friends you\u2019ve made who are going through similar experiences to you.\nWe have more information about\u00a0chemotherapy that has been written for people of all ages, not just teens and young adults.\u00a0\nGetting rid of the leukaemia (remission induction)\nThe first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. You\u2019ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. Remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow.\nThis type of treatment involves:\n\nchemotherapy to kill the leukaemia cells (including CNS therapy)\nsteroids to help the chemotherapy work\ndrugs (allopurinol or rasburicase) to help protect your kidneys from problems that can happen when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once\nanother tablet (for example ranitidine or lansoprazole) to stop indigestion or ulcers\n\nYou need to stay in hospital during this phase of your treatment so the doctors can check how things are going.\nTreatment to get you into remission takes about\u00a05 weeks, sometimes a bit longer. Being in hospital that long can be really difficult at times. If you're struggling to cope, try and talk to your friends, family, doctors and nurses. It\u2019s important not to bottle up your feelings otherwise your might end up finding it hard to cope. Drugs you may be given include:\n\nvincristine\nasparaginase\ndaunorubicin\nmercaptopurine\nmethotrexate\n\nDifferent chemotherapy can cause different side effects. There is information about the specific ones in\u00a0Macmillan's chemotherapy section.\nCentral nervous system therapy\nChemotherapy given as tablets or into the blood can reach most places in your body. But it isn\u2019t good at getting into the brain or spinal cord (called the central nervous system or CNS). So you\u2019ll be given treatment into the fluid that goes around the CNS to target any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. This is called CNS therapy.\nCNS therapy is given during remission induction treatment (to get rid of the leukaemia) and continues right until the end of maintenance therapy.\nChemotherapy is given into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, around your spinal cord. Drug treatment given into the CSF is called intrathecal therapy.\nIt\u2019s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. A doctor puts a needle into the space between 2 small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. Then they inject chemotherapy into the CSF. The CSF will carry the chemotherapy around your CNS so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there.\nThe chemotherapy drug used for CNS therapy is called methotrexate.\nMost people don\u2019t have side effects after having intrathecal methotrexate. But occasionally it can cause headaches, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours. Rarely other side effects like seizures (fits), weakness of your arms or legs and changes in how awake you are can happen. But these almost always go away completely and you can still have the intrathecal injections in the future.\nKeeping leukaemia away\nThis treatment is called consolidation and delayed intensification therapy. When you\u2019re in remission, it means the doctors can\u2019t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples when they check them under the microscope. But there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so you need further treatment to get rid of these cells.\nYou\u2019ll be given different types of chemotherapy drugs. This is so the leukaemia cells don't have a chance to get used to them (which is called drug resistance).\nThis phase of treatment takes about 5 to 6 months. Most of the treatment can be given as an outpatient but you might need to stay in hospital for some parts of it.\nDrugs you may be given include:\n\ncyclophosphamide\ncytarabine (ara-C)\nmercaptopurine\nmethotrexate\nvincristine\nasparaginase\ndoxorubicin\n\nChemotherapy does cause side effects. There is information about the specific ones in\u00a0Macmillan's chemotherapy section.\nKeeping the leukaemia away long term (maintenance therapy)\nThis treatment is given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as relapse). The chemotherapy is given in low doses. You have it as an outpatient so you can keep doing all your normal, everyday activities when you\u2019re having maintenance therapy.\nMaintenance therapy is given in 12-week cycles.\nYou\u2019ll have:\n\nmercaptopurine tablets each day\nmethotrexate tablets once a week\nsteroid tablets for 5 days every\u00a04\u00a0weeks\nvincristine chemotherapy every 4 weeks\nmethotrexate chemotherapy into your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) every 12 weeks\n\nAt the moment, boys have just over\u00a03 years of maintenance therapy and girls have just over\u00a02 years. This is because it takes a bit longer in boys to get rid of any remaining leukaemia cells.\nDuring this time, you'll have regular check-ups\u00a0\u2013 usually every week or two\u00a0\u2013 to check if your drug doses need to be adjusted and to make sure you're OK. Very often, things like blood tests can be done at your GP practice or at home by a district nurse. Ask your doctor or nurse about arranging this.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment.\nAcute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The 2 main types of white blood cells are:\n\nlymphocytes \u2013 mostly used to fight viral infections\nmyeloid cells \u2013 which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending\u00a0the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\u00a0\n\nThis topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive\u00a0cancer of the myeloid cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately:\n\nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia\nchronic myeloid leukaemia\nchronic lymphocytic leukaemia\n\nSigns and symptoms of AML\nThe\u00a0symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include:\n\npale skin\ntiredness\nbreathlessness\nfrequent infections\nunusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds\n\nIn more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding.\nRead more about the complications of AML\nSeeking medical advice\nYou should see your GP if you or your child have possible symptoms\u00a0of AML. Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause,\u00a0these symptoms should be investigated.\nIf your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange blood tests to check your blood cell production. If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing AML\nWhat causes AML?\nAML\u00a0occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones),\u00a0produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells.\nBlast cells don't have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can\u00a0lead to a\u00a0decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot).\nIt's not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause. However,\u00a0a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include:\n\nprevious\u00a0chemotherapy or radiotherapy\nexposure to very high levels of radiation\u00a0(including previous\u00a0 radiotherapy\u00a0treatment)\nexposure to benzene \u2013 a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke\nhaving an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as Down's syndrome\n\nRead more about the causes of AML\nWho's affected\nAML\u00a0is a rare type of cancer.\u00a0The risk of developing AML increases with\u00a0age. It's\u00a0most common in people over 65.\nHow AML is treated\nAML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed.\nChemotherapy\u00a0is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing).\nIn some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a\u00a0bone marrow or stem cell transplant, to achieve a cure.\nRead more about treating AML\n\n\nThe symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) usually develop over a few weeks, becoming more severe as the number of immature white blood cells (blast cells) in your blood increases.\nSymptoms of AML can\u00a0include:\n\npale skin\ntiredness\nbreathlessness\na high temperature (fever)\nexcessive sweating\nweight loss\nfrequent infections\nunusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds\neasily bruised skin\nflat\u00a0red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae)\nbone and joint pain\na feeling of fullness or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen), caused by swelling of the liver or spleen\n\nIn\u00a0rare cases of AML, the affected cells can spread into the central nervous system. This can cause symptoms such as headaches, fits (seizures), vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee your GP if you or your child have these symptoms. Although it's highly unlikely that AML is the cause, these symptoms need to be investigated and treated\u00a0promptly.\n\n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells in your bone marrow that produce red blood cells, platelets and infection-fighting white blood cells.\nThe mutation\u00a0causes the stem cells\u00a0to produce many more white blood cells that are needed.\nThe white blood cells produced are still immature, so they don't have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. These immature cells are known as 'blast cells'.\nAs the number of immature cells increases, the amount of healthy red blood cells and platelets decrease, and it's this fall that causes many of the symptoms of leukaemia.\nIncreased risk\nIt's not known what triggers the genetic mutation\u00a0in AML, although a number of different factors that\u00a0can increase your risk of developing the condition have been identified.\nThe main risk factors for AML are\u00a0outlined below.\nBeing exposed to\u00a0a significant level of radiation\u00a0can increase your chances of developing AML, although this usually requires exposure\u00a0at very high levels. For example, rates of AML are higher in people who survived\u00a0the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945.\nIn the UK, most people\u00a0are unlikely to be exposed to levels of radiation high enough to cause AML.\u00a0However, some people who have had radiotherapy as part of their treatment for previous cancer (see below) can be the exception.\nExposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for AML in adults. Benzene is found in petrol, and it's also used in the rubber industry, although there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.\nBenzene is also found in cigarette smoke, which could explain why people who smoke have an increased risk of developing AML.\nTreatment with radiotherapy and certain chemotherapy medications for\u00a0an earlier, unrelated cancer can increase your risk of developing AML many years later.\nLeukaemia that develops as a result of previous cancer treatment is called 'secondary leukaemia' or 'treatment-related leukaemia'.\nPeople with certain blood disorders \u2013 such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis or\u00a0polycythaemia vera (PCV) \u2013 have an increased risk of developing AML.\nPeople with certain genetic disorders, including Down\u2019s syndrome and Fanconi\u2019s anaemia, have an increased risk of developing leukaemia.\nA number of other environmental factors that could trigger AML have also been suggested, including childhood vaccinations and living near a nuclear power station or a high-voltage power line. However, there's no clear\u00a0evidence to suggest that these can increase your risk of developing AML.\n\n\nIn the initial stages of diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), your GP will check for physical signs of the condition and arrange for you to have blood tests.\nA high number of abnormal white blood cells, or a very low blood count in the test sample, could indicate the presence of leukaemia. If this is the case, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions).\nA haematologist may carry out further blood tests, in addition to some of the tests outlined on this page.\nBone marrow biopsy\nTo confirm a diagnosis of AML, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. This procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy, which is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic.\nThe haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a thin needle to remove a sample of liquid bone marrow. In some cases, a larger needle may also be used to remove a small amount of bone and bone marrow together.\nYou won't feel any pain during the procedure, but you may experience some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete, and you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight.\nThe bone marrow sample will be checked for cancerous cells. If cancerous cells are present, the biopsy can also be used to determine the type of leukaemia you have.\nFurther tests\nAdditional tests can be used to reveal more information about the progress and extent of your AML. They can also provide insight into how the condition should be treated. These tests are described below.\nGenetic tests can be carried out on blood and bone marrow samples to identify the genetic makeup of the cancerous cells. There are many specific genetic variations that can occur in AML, and knowing the exact type of AML you have can help doctors make decisions about the most appropriate treatment.\nFor example, people who have a type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) are known to respond well to a medicine called All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA).\nIf you have AML, a\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan,\u00a0X-ray or echocardiogram (an\u00a0ultrasound scan of the heart) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy.\nThese tests are carried out because it's important for doctors to assess your general health before they can decide on the most appropriate treatment for you.\nIn rare situations where it's thought there's a risk that AML has spread to your nervous system, a lumbar puncture\u00a0may be carried out. In this procedure, a needle is used to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects your spine) from your back, so it can be checked for cancerous cells.\nIf cancerous cells are found in your nervous system, you may need to have injections of chemotherapy medication directly into your cerebrospinal fluid as part of your treatment.\n\n\nAcute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, so treatment will usually begin a few days after a diagnosis has been confirmed.\nAs AML is a complex condition, it's usually treated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) \u2013 a group of different specialists working together.\nYour treatment plan\nTreatment for AML is often carried out in 2 stages:\n\ninduction \u2013 the aim of this initial stage of treatment is to kill as many leukaemia cells in your blood and bone marrow as possible, restore your blood to proper working order and treat any symptoms you may have\nconsolidation \u2013 this stage aims to prevent the cancer returning (relapsing), by killing any remaining leukaemia cells that may be present in your body\n\nThe induction stage of treatment isn't always successful and sometimes needs to be repeated before consolidation can begin.\nIf you have a relapse after treatment, both re-induction and consolidation may need to be carried out. This may be the same as your first treatment, although it's likely to involve different medications or a stem cell transplant.\nIf you're thought to have a high risk of experiencing complications of AML treatment \u2013 for example, if you're over 75 years of age or have another underlying health condition \u2013 less intensive chemotherapy treatment may be carried out. This is less likely to successfully kill all of the cancerous cells in your body, but it can help control your condition.\u00a0\nInduction\nThe initial treatment you have for AML will largely depend on whether you're fit enough to have intensive\u00a0chemotherapy, or whether treatment at a lower dosage is recommended.\nIf you can have intensive induction chemotherapy, you'll usually be given a combination of chemotherapy medication at a high dose to kill the cancerous cells in your blood and bone marrow.\nThis stage of treatment will be carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre, as you'll need very close medical and nursing supervision.\nYou'll have regular\u00a0blood transfusions\u00a0because your blood won't contain enough healthy blood cells.\nYou'll also be vulnerable to infection, so it's important that you're in a clean and stable environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed\u00a0antibiotics to help prevent further infection.\nDepending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from four weeks to a couple of months. You may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve.\nFor intensive treatment, the chemotherapy medications will be injected into a thin tube that's inserted either into a blood vessel near your heart (central line) or into your arm (a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC).\nIn very rare cases, chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This is done using a needle that's placed into your spine, in a similar way to a\u00a0lumbar puncture.\nSide effects of intensive chemotherapy for AML are common. They can include:\u00a0\n\nnausea\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\nloss of appetite\nsore mouth and mouth ulcers (mucositis)\ntiredness\nskin rashes\nhair loss\ninfertility \u2013 which may be temporary or permanent (see complications of AML for more information)\n\nMost side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Tell a member of your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are medicines that can help you cope better with certain side effects.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nIf your doctors don\u2019t think you're fit enough to withstand the effects of intensive chemotherapy, they may recommend non-intensive treatment. This involves using an alternative type of chemotherapy to the standard intensive therapy, which\u00a0is designed more to control leukaemia rather than cure it.\nThe main aim of this treatment is to control the level of cancerous cells in your body and limit any symptoms you have, while reducing your risk of experiencing significant side effects of treatment.\nThe medications used during non-intensive chemotherapy may be given through a drip into a vein, by mouth or by injection under the skin, and can often be given on an outpatient basis.\nIf you have the sub-type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, you'll usually be given capsules of a medicine called ATRA, in addition to chemotherapy.\nATRA works by changing the immature white blood cells (blast cells) into mature healthy cells, and can reduce symptoms very quickly.\nSide effects of ATRA can include headaches, nausea, bone pain, and dry mouth, skin and eyes.\nConsolidation\nIf induction is successful, the next stage of treatment will be consolidation.\nThis often involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication that are usually given on an outpatient basis, which means that you won't have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may need some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection.\nThe consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months.\nOther treatments\nMany other treatments are used for AML.\u00a0\nRadiotherapy\u00a0involves using high doses of controlled radiation\u00a0to kill cancerous cells. There are 2 main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat AML:\n\nto prepare the body for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant\nto treat advanced cases that have spread to the nervous system and/or brain, although this is uncommon\n\nSide effects of radiotherapy\u00a0can include hair loss, nausea and fatigue. The side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed.\nIf chemotherapy doesn't work, a possible alternative treatment option is a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\nBefore transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have\u00a0intensive high-dose chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy to destroy the cells in their bone marrow. The donated stem cells are given through a tube into a blood vessel, in a similar way to chemotherapy medication.\nThis process can put an enormous amount of strain on the body and cause significant side effects and potential complications, so you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few weeks.\nTransplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.\nTransplantations are most successful when they're carried out on children and young people, or older people who are otherwise in good health, and when there's a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister.\nRead\u00a0about\u00a0bone marrow donation\nAzacitidine is a possible alternative treatment for adults with AML who can't have a stem cell transplant.\nIt's recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use\u00a0in certain circumstances\u00a0\u2013 for example, depending on the characteristics of the person's blood and bone marrow.\nAzacitidine is a chemotherapy medication that's given by injection under the skin. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells and destroys them, and also helps bone marrow to produce normal blood cells.\nNICE has\u00a0more information about azacitidine for the treatment of AML\nClinical trials and\u00a0newer unlicensed treatments\nIn the UK, a number of clinical trials\u00a0are currently underway that aim to find the best way of treating AML. Clinical trials are studies that use new and experimental techniques to see how well they work in treating, and possibly curing, AML.\nAs part of your treatment, your care team may suggest taking part in a clinical trial to help researchers learn more about the best way to treat your\u00a0AML, and AML in general. Search for clinical trials for AML.\nIf you take part in a clinical trial, you may be offered medication that isn't licensed for use in the UK and isn't normally available. However, there's no guarantee that the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will work better than current treatments.\nYour care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved.\nMacmillan has more information about unlicensed treatments for AML\n\n\nIf you have acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), you may experience a number of complications. These can be caused by the condition itself, although they can also occur as a side effect of treatment.\nWeakened immune system\nHaving a weakened immune system \u2013 being immunocompromised \u2013 is a common complication of AML.\nEven if your blood is restored to normal working order with treatment, many of the medications that are used to treat\u00a0AML can temporarily weaken your immune system.\nThis means you're more vulnerable to developing an infection, and any infection you develop could be more serious than usual. Complications arising from infection are the leading cause of death in people with AML. However, if treated early, nearly all infections respond to appropriate treatment.\nTherefore, you may be advised to:\n\ntake regular doses of antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections\nmaintain good personal and dental hygiene\navoid contact with anyone who's\u00a0known to have an infection \u2013 even if it's a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as\u00a0chickenpox or measles\ncheck with your GP to ensure that all of your vaccinations are up to date, although\u00a0you won't be able to have any vaccine that contains 'live' viruses or bacteria, such as the\u00a0shingles vaccine and MMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella)\n\nReport any possible symptoms of an infection\u00a0to your\u00a0treatment unit immediately because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent complications.\nSymptoms of an infection can\u00a0include:\n\na high temperature (fever)\na\u00a0headache\naching muscles\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\n\nBleeding\nIf you have AML, you'll bleed and bruise more easily due to the low levels of platelets (clot-forming cells) in your blood. Bleeding may also be excessive.\nPeople with advanced AML are more\u00a0vulnerable to excessive bleeding inside their body, which is the second most common cause of death in people with the condition.\nSerious bleeding can occur:\n\ninside\u00a0the skull (intracranial haemorrhage) \u2013 causing symptoms such as a\u00a0severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting and confusion\ninside the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) \u2013 causing\u00a0symptoms such as coughing up blood,\u00a0breathing difficulties and a\u00a0bluish skin tone (cyanosis)\ninside the stomach (gastrointestinal haemorrhage) \u2013 causing symptoms such as\u00a0vomiting blood and\u00a0passing stools (faeces) that are very dark or tar-like in colour\n\nAll these types of haemorrhage should be regarded as medical emergencies. Dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you think a haemorrhage is occurring.\nInfertility\nMany of the treatments that are used to treat AML can cause infertility.\u00a0This is often temporary, but in some cases can be permanent.\nPeople who are particularly at risk of permanent infertility, are those who have received high doses of chemotherapy and\u00a0radiotherapy in preparation for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.\nYour treatment team can give a good estimation of the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances.\nIt may be possible to guard against any risk of infertility before you begin your treatment. For example, men can have their sperm samples stored. Similarly, women can have eggs or\u00a0fertilised embryos stored, which can then be placed back into their womb, following treatment.\nHowever, as AML is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, there may not always be time to do this before treatment needs to start.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\nFor information about AML in people of all ages,\u00a0read our general\u00a0AML section.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.\nImmature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn\u2019t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to:\n\nhelp fight infection (white cells)\ncarry oxygen from the lungs around the body (red blood cells)\nstop\u00a0cuts bleeding by clotting blood (platelets)\n\nSymptoms\nMany of the symptoms of AML are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:\n\nlooking paler than usual and feeling tired \u2013\u00a0because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)\nbruises or bleeding\u00a0\u2013 you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal\ninfections\u00a0\u2013 because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection\naches and pains in your bones\nswollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin\nfeeling unwell and run down\nfever and sweats\u00a0\u2013 you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection\nheadaches and blurred vision\u00a0\u2013 because of too many white blood cells\nbreathlessness\u00a0\u2013 because of too many white blood cells.\n\nCauses\nIt's not known\u00a0exactly what causes AML. Research is going on to try to find out. We do know some things might increase the risk of AML:\n\nsome genetic conditions, like Down's Syndrome\u00a0(a\u00a0genetic condition is something you are born with)\nsome non-cancerous conditions of the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes\n\nIf you're worried about AML\nIf you think you might have any of the symptoms of AML, you should go to your GP. They'll talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and can arrange\u00a0tests or refer you to see a specialist.\u00a0Remember that the symptoms can be caused by other things, but it\u2019s important to go and get checked if you are worried.\u00a0\n\n\nTo understand leukaemia, it can help to know a little about the blood and bone marrow.\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells.\nAll blood cells are made in the bone marrow, which is like a blood cell factory inside bones. A type of cell in the bone marrow, called a stem cell, can make any kind of blood cell your body needs.\nThere are\u00a03 main types of blood cells:\n\nwhite blood cells \u2013\u00a0which help fight infection\nred blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen from the lungs around the body\nplatelets \u2013 which clot blood to stop cuts bleeding\n\nThe bone marrow normally makes millions of blood cells every day. To begin with, these new blood cells, called blasts, are not fully developed (they\u2019re immature).\nThe main job of blast cells is to make more blood cells like themselves. They can\u2019t do any of the jobs that mature blood cells can do, like carrying oxygen or fighting infection. Blast cells normally stay inside the bone marrow until they\u2019ve matured into fully-developed blood cells.\nOnce blood cells are mature, they\u2019re ready to do their jobs. They leave the bone marrow and go into the bloodstream, where they can be carried to wherever they\u2019re needed.\nHow leukaemia develops\nIn leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control and immature white blood cells (blasts) keep being made.\nThey build up in the bone marrow until there isn\u2019t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white cells, red cells and platelets.\nTypes of leukaemia\nLeukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Healthy white blood cells are made from\u00a02 types of blood cells:\n\nlymphoblasts that make lymphocytes\nmyeloid cells (myeloblasts) that make other types of white blood cells such as neutrophils\n\nLeukaemias are named after the type of white blood cell that has become abnormal and started growing out of control. The most common types in teenagers and young adults are AML and ALL:\n\nacute myeloid leukaemia\u00a0(AML) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal myeloid cells\nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is leukaemia that starts from abnormal lymphoblasts\n\nThere are other types of leukaemia that are more common in older people.\nThe information in this section is about ALL, but if you have a different type of leukaemia and want to know more,\u00a0contact Macmillan.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms and causes of AML\u00a0\nhaving tests for AML\u00a0\nbeing treated for AML\u00a0\n\nIf you're looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, read general\u00a0AML section.\n\n\nYou should speak to your GP as soon as possible if you think you have some of the\u00a0symptoms of AML. But remember that the symptoms of AML can be caused by other things.\nVisiting your GP\nYour GP will examine you and arrange for you to have blood tests. There can be different reasons for your symptoms, so you\u2019ll need to have a blood test to help diagnose acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). If you have AML, a blood test will usually find leukaemia cells and you'll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.\nThis specialist is called a haematologist and is a doctor who treats people with blood disorders.\nAt the hospital\nThe haematologist will examine you and ask you about your symptoms and any recent illnesses. They will also arrange for you to have some more tests. These may include:\n\nblood tests\u00a0\u2013 you\u2019ll need more blood tests even if you\u2019ve had some already to\u00a0look at the changes in the leukaemia cells and help the doctors decide on the best treatment for you; these tests may be called cytogenetics and immunophenotyping\nbone marrow test\u00a0\u2013 to count the numbers of leukaemia cells in the bone marrow\u00a0and get send samples for cytogenetic and immunophenotyping testing\nlumbar puncture\u00a0\u2013 a small sample of the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord is taken to check for leukaemia cells\nchest X-ray\u00a0\u2013 this may also be done to see if there are any swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your chest\n\nIf you have AML, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. These could be blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the tummy (abdomen) to look at your liver, spleen and kidneys, or an echocardiogram (which is an ultrasound of the heart).\nThis may seem like a lot of tests, but they give the doctors important information that will help them give you the right treatment.\nWaiting for test results can be a scary time, but understanding a little about them\u00a0\u2013 what will happen, how you'll feel and when you'll get the results\u00a0\u2013 can help you cope. Thinking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can also make it a bit easier. You could also talk to a cancer support specialist on Macmillan's free helpline.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms and causes of AML\u00a0\nbeing treated for AML\nleukaemia, blood cells and bone marrow\n\nIf you're looking for information about AML in people of all ages, read our general AML\u00a0section.\n\n\nThe main treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is chemotherapy. This means having anti-cancer drugs to destroy the leukaemia cells. You\u2019ll also have drugs called steroids, which help the chemotherapy to work.\nThe treatment for AML is pretty intensive at times and can cause unpleasant side effects. But you'll be in hospital when you\u2019re most likely to feel unwell, and the staff can help if things get tough. Don\u2019t feel you have to be brave. Be honest about how you're feeling with your doctors and nurses. They can give you medicines to help you feel better.\nThere are different phases of treatment for AML:\n\ngetting rid of the leukaemia \u2013 remission induction\nkeeping the leukaemia away\u00a0\u2013 consolidation and delayed intensification therapy\ncentral nervous system (CNS) therapy (mainly for teenagers under 16)\n\nVery often, treatment is given as part of a clinical trial or research study, but it will be your decision whether to take part in the trial or not. Clinical trials help doctors to keep improving treatment for leukaemia. \u00a0\nYou usually start chemotherapy pretty quickly after finding out that you have AML.\nYou'll be in hospital for your treatment to begin with.\u00a0If you're 18 or younger, you'll be treated in a specialist Principal Treatment Centre (PTC) for teenage and young adults (TYA).\u00a0If you're 19 or older, you'll be offered the choice of having treatment at the PTC or another hospital closer to home called a TYA designated hospital.\nMost chemotherapy for AML is given into the bloodstream (intravenously). So you\u2019ll have a \u2018line\u2019 put into one of your main veins to make it easier for you to have intravenous chemotherapy. There are different kinds of lines.\nYou\u2019ll also be given chemotherapy into the fluid around your spinal cord and brain. This is to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be hiding there. This type of treatment is called central nervous system (CNS) therapy.\nHaving chemotherapy can be hard, but the staff looking after you will give you medicines to help you cope with any side effects so you can stay strong enough to have treatment. And you\u2019ll be given medicines to help you feel less sick and antibiotics to help prevent infections.\nThere will probably be times when you feel rough and other times when you\u2019ll feel better. You might also feel upset, down or irritable. Talking to someone you trust can help you cope with these feelings.\nBeing in hospital for long periods can be frustrating, especially when you miss out on stuff happening at school, college, university or work or on things your friends are doing. You could try talking to your friends and family about this and see what they can do to help you.\nGetting rid of the leukaemia (remission induction)\nThe first phase of your treatment is about getting rid of the leukaemia. You\u2019ll be given chemotherapy to kill as many leukaemia cells as possible. Remission means there is no sign of leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow.\nYou have chemotherapy over a few days, then you have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. You\u2019ll usually have\u00a04 cycles of chemotherapy overall with\u00a02 courses in the induction phase. Some people might also need to have a bone marrow transplant. This normally happens after 2 cycles of chemotherapy.\nYou'll probably need to stay in hospital most of the time that you\u2019re having remission induction. This is so that the doctors can check how things are going.\nDrugs you may have include:\n\ncytarabine (Ara-C)\ndaunorubicin, doxorubicin or idarubicin\netoposide\nthioguanine\n\nDifferent chemotherapy can cause different side effects. There is information about the specific ones in\u00a0Macmillan's chemotherapy section.\nAs well as the chemotherapy drugs, you\u2019ll be given other drugs to:\n\nhelp prevent you from feeling sick or being sick\nhelp prevent infections\nprotect your kidneys as sometimes when lots of leukaemia cells are destroyed at once it can cause kidney problems\n\nYou\u2019ll probably also need blood and platelet transfusions to top up the numbers of red cells and platelets in your blood.\nChemotherapy can cause side effects. Most of them are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common side effects are:\n\nbeing more at risk of infections\nfeeling sick\nhair loss\na sore mouth\n\nSometimes side effects can be long-term. For example, some chemotherapy treatments can affect fertility (your ability to have a baby). If you are a young man, you will be offered the chance to store sperm before chemotherapy is started. There may be other late effects of treatment and your specialist can talk to you about this.\nRemission induction is pretty intense treatment and you\u2019ll probably feel a bit wiped out sometimes. You\u2019ll need to stay in hospital for most of the time and you might not have the energy to do much. You might feel fed up, tearful or irritable. It\u2019s normal to feel like this. It's hard to be in hospital and you might worry about losing touch with your friends or falling behind at school or college. It can help to talk about this with a friend, doctor, nurse or counsellor.\nKeeping the leukaemia away (post-remission treatment)\nThis phase of treatment is sometimes also called consolidation or intensification treatment. It\u2019s given to prevent the leukaemia from returning (known as a relapse).\nWhen you\u2019re in remission, it means the doctors can\u2019t see any leukaemia cells in your blood or bone marrow samples under the microscope. But there may still be leukaemia cells hiding in your body, so further treatment is needed to get rid of these cells.\nYou start post-remission treatment soon after you complete remission induction. You\u2019ll usually have\u00a02 courses of treatment. You might be given the same chemotherapy drugs you\u2019ve had before (perhaps at similar or higher doses) or you might be given different chemotherapy drugs.\nWhen your doctors decide what chemotherapy treatment plan to give you, they will take into account:\n\nhow well your leukaemia responded to the first lot of treatment (remission induction)\nthe results of the tests that were done when you were diagnosed\n\nThe following drugs may be used to treat you:\n\ncytarabine (ara-C)\nmethotrexate\n\nCentral nervous system therapy (CNS)\nYou usually won\u2019t need this treatment if you\u2019re 16 or over. But if you\u2019re under 16, you\u2019ll probably have it.\nCNS therapy is given to get rid of any leukaemia cells that might be in the brain or spinal cord. (The CNS or central nervous system is the name for the brain and spinal cord.)\nCNS therapy involves giving chemotherapy into the fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid or CSF, around the spinal cord and brain.\nIt\u2019s a bit like having a lumbar puncture but with chemotherapy added. A doctor puts a needle into the space between two small bones (vertebrae) near the bottom of your spine. Then they inject chemotherapy into the CSF. The CSF will carry the chemotherapy around your CNS so it can reach any leukaemia cells that might be there.\nYou\u2019ll have a lumbar puncture before you start treatment to check for leukaemia cells in the CSF.\nIf there is no sign of leukaemia cells, you\u2019ll have\u00a02 lots of CNS therapy,\u00a01 after each cycle of remission induction therapy.\nIf there are leukaemia cells in the CSF, you\u2019ll have CNS therapy twice a week until all traces of leukaemia cells in your CSF have gone. You\u2019ll then have\u00a02 more lots of CNS therapy just to make sure.\nFor CNS therapy for AML, you\u2019ll have chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate and cytarabine and a steroid called hydrocortisone.\nThe most common side effect is feeling sick but you can be given anti-sickness treatment to help this. Rarer side effects include a headache, dizziness, tiredness or blurry vision for a few hours afterwards.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms and causes of AML\u00a0\nhaving tests for AML\u00a0\nleukaemia, blood cells and bone marrow\n\nIf you're looking for information about AML in people of all ages, read our general AML section.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage.\nMost people with\u00a0acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal.\nAcute pancreatitis is different to\u00a0chronic pancreatitis, where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years.\nThe most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include:\n\nsuddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your abdomen (tummy)\nfeeling or being sick\ndiarrhoea\n\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of acute pancreatitis\u00a0and diagnosing acute pancreatitis.\nWhen to seek medical help\nContact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain.

However, 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0cases are severe and\u00a0can result in life-threatening complications, such as\u00a0multiple organ failure.\nIn severe cases where\u00a0complications develop, there's a high\u00a0risk of\u00a0the condition\u00a0being fatal. In England, just over 1,000 people die from acute pancreatitis every year.\nIf a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it's likely to be several weeks or months before they're well enough to leave hospital.\nRead more about the possible\u00a0complications of acute pancreatitis.\n\n\nThe main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly.\nThis aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. Eating or drinking\u00a0may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods.\nLeaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain.\nAcute pancreatitis caused by gallstones\u00a0usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6-12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol.\nOther symptoms\nOther symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:\n\nnausea (feeling sick) or vomiting\ndiarrhoea\nindigestion\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\njaundice \u2013 yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes\ntenderness or swelling of the abdomen (tummy)\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nContact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn't possible,\u00a0contact\u00a0NHS 24 111 Service or your local\u00a0out-of-hours service for advice.\n\n\nMost cases of acute pancreatitis are closely linked to gallstones or to alcohol consumption, although the exact cause isn't always clear.\nGallstones\nGallstones are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in your gallbladder. They can trigger acute pancreatitis if they move out of the gallbladder and block the opening of the pancreas.\nThe blockage can disrupt some of the enzymes (chemicals) produced by the pancreas. These enzymes are normally used to help digest food in your intestines, but they\u00a0can\u00a0start to digest the pancreas instead if\u00a0the opening is\u00a0blocked.\nHowever, not everyone with gallstones will develop acute pancreatitis. Most gallstones don't cause any problems.\nAlcohol consumption\nIt's not fully understood how alcohol causes the pancreas to become inflamed. One theory is that it interferes with the normal workings of the pancreas, causing the enzymes to start digesting it.\nWhatever the cause, there is a clear link between alcohol use and acute pancreatitis. A very large study found that people who regularly drank more than 35 units of alcohol\u00a0a week were 4\u00a0times more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than people who never drank alcohol (35 units is the equivalent\u00a0of drinking around 16 cans of strong lager or 4\u00a0bottles of wine a week).\nBinge drinking,\u00a0which is drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time, is also thought to increase your risk of developing acute pancreatitis.\nOther causes\nLess common causes of acute pancreatitis include:\n\naccidental damage or injury to the pancreas \u2013 for example, during\u00a0a procedure\u00a0to\u00a0remove gallstones or examine the pancreas\ncertain types of medication,\u00a0such as some antibiotics or chemotherapy medication \u2013 acute pancreatitis can be\u00a0an unexpected side effect of these in a small number of people\na viral infection \u2013 such as mumps\u00a0or measles\na complication of cystic fibrosis\ncertain rare conditions \u2013 including hyperparathyroidism, Reye's syndrome\u00a0and Kawasaki disease\n\nSevere pancreatitis\nLittle is known about why some people develop severe acute pancreatitis. Factors thought to increase your risk include:\n\nbeing 70 years of age or over\nbeing obese\u00a0(a person is considered obese if they have a\u00a0body mass index (BMI) of 30 or above)\nhaving 2\u00a0or more alcoholic drinks a day\nsmoking\n\nResearchers have also discovered that people with a specific genetic mutation, known as the MCP-1 mutation, are 8\u00a0times more likely to develop severe acute pancreatitis than the general population. A genetic mutation is where the instructions (DNA) found in all living cells become scrambled, resulting in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics.\n\n\nMost cases of acute pancreatitis are diagnosed in hospital because of the risk of serious complications.\nThe doctor in charge of your care will ask you about the history of your symptoms. They may also carry out a physical examination. If you have acute pancreatitis, certain areas of your abdomen will be very tender to touch.\nA blood test will be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis. This\u00a0can detect signs of acute pancreatitis,\u00a0such as\u00a0a high level of 2\u00a0chemicals called lipase and amylase.\nAt first, it can be difficult to tell whether your acute pancreatitis is mild or severe. You'll be monitored closely for signs of serious problems, such as organ failure.\nPeople with mild acute pancreatitis tend to improve within a week and experience either no further problems or problems that resolve within 48 hours. People with severe acute pancreatitis develop persistent serious problems.\nFurther testing\nSeveral tests may be used to help determine the severity of your condition and\u00a0assess your risk of developing more serious complications.\nYou may have any of the following tests:\n\na computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of your pancreas\na\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body\nan ultrasound scan \u2013 where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n\nAn ERCP uses a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. The endoscope will be passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. A special dye that shows up on\u00a0X-rays is then injected through the endoscope into your bile and pancreatic ducts. After the dye has been injected, X-rays will be taken.\nThis test can be useful in cases of gallbladder-associated acute pancreatitis, because it can pinpoint exactly where the gallstone is located. In some cases, it may be possible to pass surgical instruments down the endoscope, so the gallstone can be removed.\n\n\nAcute pancreatitis is treated in hospital, where you'll be closely monitored for signs of serious problems and given supportive treatment, such as fluids and oxygen.\nMany people are well enough to leave hospital after 5-10 days.\nIn severe cases, complications can develop that require specific additional treatment and you'll need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit (ICU). In these cases, recovery\u00a0may take much longer, and the condition can be fatal.\nRead about the potential\u00a0complications of acute pancreatitis for more information\u00a0on severe cases.\nFluids\nYour body can become dehydrated during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids are provided through a tube connected to one of your veins (this is known as intravenous, or IV, fluid).\nIn severe cases of acute pancreatitis, IV fluids can help to prevent a serious problem called hypovolemic shock, which occurs when a drop in your fluid levels lowers the amount of blood in your body.\nNutritional support\nAlthough the diet of many people with mild acute pancreatitis isn't restricted, some\u00a0people are advised not to\u00a0eat. This is because trying to digest solid food could place too much strain on your pancreas.\nDepending on the severity of the condition, you may not be able to eat solid foods\u00a0for a few days or longer.\nIf you\u00a0need to avoid solid food, a feeding tube may be\u00a0used to provide your body with nutrients. This is known as enteral feeding and\u00a0often involves using\u00a0a tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube).\nOxygen\nTo ensure your vital organs have enough oxygen, it will usually be supplied through tubes into your nose. The tubes can be removed after a few days, once your condition is improving.\nIn severe cases, ventilation equipment may also be used to assist with your breathing.\nPainkillers\nAcute pancreatitis often causes severe abdominal (tummy) pain, so strong painkilling medication will probably be required, such as morphine.\u00a0\nSome of the painkillers used can make you feel very drowsy. If you're visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don't be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive.\nTreating the underlying cause\nOnce\u00a0the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need to be treated. Treatments for the most common causes of acute pancreatitis \u2013 gallstones and alcohol consumption \u2013 are outlined below.\nIf a\u00a0gallstone is responsible for the pancreatitis,\u00a0you may need\u00a0a procedure called\u00a0endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),\u00a0or your gallbladder may need to be removed.\nGallbladder removal surgery\u00a0may be done while you're in hospital, or it\u00a0may be planned for several weeks' time. Having your gallbladder removed should have no significant effect on your health, other than making it more difficult to digest certain foods, such as fatty or spicy foods.\nAn ERCP procedure is an alternative treatment for gallstones. It involves using a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end.\nX-rays\u00a0guide the endoscope into your digestive system, and\u00a0surgical instruments\u00a0are passed\u00a0down the endoscope\u00a0to remove\u00a0the gallstones.\nAfter recovering from acute pancreatitis, alcohol should be completely avoided\u00a0if this was the cause of the condition. If you find this difficult, you'll probably need additional treatment.\nTreatment options for alcohol dependence include:\n\none-to-one\u00a0counselling\nself-help groups \u2013 such as Alcoholics Anonymous\na medication called acamprosate \u2013 which helps to reduce your alcohol cravings\n\n\n\nAlthough most people with acute pancreatitis recover without experiencing further problems, severe cases can have serious complications.\nPseudocysts\nPseudocysts are sacs of fluid that can develop on the surface of the pancreas. They're a common complication of acute pancreatitis, thought to affect around 1 in 20 people with the condition.\nPseudocysts usually develop four weeks after the symptoms of acute pancreatitis start. In many cases, they don't cause any symptoms and are only detected during a computerised tomography (CT) scan.\nHowever, in some people, pseudocysts can cause bloating, indigestion and a dull abdominal (tummy) pain.\nIf the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for further treatment, as they usually go away on their own.\nTreatment is usually recommended if you're experiencing symptoms or if\u00a0the pseudocysts are large. Larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection.\nPseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst by inserting a needle into\u00a0it through your skin. This can also be done by carrying out an endoscopy, where\u00a0a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.\nInfected pancreatic necrosis\nIn around 1\u00a0in 3\u00a0severe cases of acute pancreatitis,\u00a0a serious complication called infected pancreatic necrosis occurs.\nIn infected pancreatic necrosis, high levels of inflammation cause an interruption to the blood supply of your pancreas. Without a consistent supply of blood, some of the tissue of your pancreas will die. Necrosis is the medical term for the death of tissue.\nThe dead tissue is extremely vulnerable to infection from bacteria. Once an infection has occurred, it can quickly spread into the blood (blood poisoning) and cause multiple organ failure. If left untreated, infected pancreatic necrosis is almost always fatal.\nInfected pancreatic necrosis usually develops 2\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks after the\u00a0symptoms of acute pancreatitis starts. Symptoms include increased abdominal pain and a high temperature. The infection\u00a0is treated with injections of antibiotics, and the dead tissue needs to be removed to prevent the infection returning.\nIn some cases, it may be possible to drain away the dead tissue using a thin tube called a catheter, which is placed through the skin.\nAlternatively, laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) can be used.\u00a0A small cut\u00a0is made in your back and an endoscope is inserted to wash away any dead tissue. If laparoscopic surgery\u00a0isn't possible, a cut\u00a0can be\u00a0made in your abdomen to allow the dead tissue to be removed.\nInfected pancreatic necrosis is a very serious complication. Even with the highest standards of medical care, the risk of dying from organ failure is estimated to be around 1\u00a0in 5.\nSystemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)\nAnother common complication of severe acute pancreatitis is systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS develops in an estimated 1 in 10 severe cases of acute pancreatitis.\nIn SIRS, the inflammation affecting the pancreas spreads throughout the body, which can cause one or more organs to fail. It usually develops during the first week after the\u00a0symptoms start, with most cases developing on the same day.\nSymptoms of SIRS include:\n\na rise in body temperature to above 38C (100.4F) or a fall in body temperature to below 36C (96.8F)\na rapid heartbeat of more than 90 beats a minute\nan unusually fast breathing rate (more than 20 breaths a minute)\n\nThere's currently no cure for SIRS, so treatment involves trying to support the body's functions until the inflammation has passed. The outcome depends on how many organs fail. The higher the number of organs affected, the greater the risk of death.\nChronic pancreatitis\nIf you have repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, the damage to your pancreas may lead to chronic pancreatitis.\nChronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition that can have a serious impact on your quality of life.\n\n\nAs acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones or excessive alcohol consumption, a healthy lifestyle can reduce your chances of developing the condition.\nGallstones\nThe most effective way\u00a0of preventing\u00a0gallstones is eating a healthy, balanced\u00a0diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5\u00a0portions a day).\nYour diet should also include wholegrains, found in wholemeal bread, oats and brown rice. This helps lower the amount of cholesterol in your body.\u00a0\nThere is also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce your risk of developing gallstones.\nBecause of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it's advisable to avoid eating too many fatty foods with a high cholesterol content.\nFoods high in cholesterol include:\n\nmeat pies\nsausages and fatty cuts of meat\nbutter and lard\ncakes and biscuits\n\nBeing overweight also increases your chances of developing gallstones, so maintaining a healthy\u00a0weight by eating a\u00a0balanced diet and taking plenty of regular exercise can also\u00a0help reduce your risk of developing\u00a0the condition.\nSee exercise,\u00a0healthy eating and losing weight\u00a0for more information and advice.\nAlcohol\nLimiting the amount of alcohol you drink can help prevent your pancreas being damaged, and\u00a0reduce your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. It can also lower your chances of developing other serious conditions, such as liver cancer.\n\nmen and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week\nspread your drinking over 3\u00a0days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week\n\nA unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine or an alcopop\u00a0is 1.5 units.\nRead the pages on\u00a0drinking and alcohol\u00a0for more information and advice.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Addison\u2019s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands.\nThe adrenal glands are two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce\u00a0essential hormones: cortisol,\u00a0aldosterone and adrenaline.\nIn Addison's disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced.\nAbout 8,400 people in the UK have Addison's disease. It can affect people of any age, although it's most common between the ages of 30 and 50.\u00a0It's also more common in women than\u00a0men.\nEarly-stage symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as\u00a0depression or flu.\u00a0You may experience:\n\nfatigue (lack of energy or motivation)\nmuscle weakness\nlow mood\nloss of appetite and unintentional weight loss\nincreased thirst\n\nOver time, these\u00a0problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting,\u00a0cramps\u00a0and exhaustion. You may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums.\nAlthough these symptoms aren\u2019t always caused by Addison\u2019s disease, you should\u00a0see your GP, so they can be investigated.\nRead more about the symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease\u00a0and diagnosing Addison\u2019s disease\nWhy it happens\nThe condition\u00a0is\u00a0usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. It's not clear why this happens, but it's responsible for 70-90% of cases in the UK.\nOther potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as\u00a0tuberculosis (TB), although this is uncommon in the UK.\nRead more about the causes of Addison\u2019s disease\nTreating Addison's disease\nAddison\u2019s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take the medication for the rest of your life.\nWith treatment, symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and\u00a0are able to\u00a0live an active life, with few limitations.\nHowever,\u00a0many people with Addison's disease also find they must learn to manage\u00a0bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such as\u00a0diabetes or an underactive thyroid.\nPeople with Addison's disease must be aware\u00a0of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. This\u00a0can happen\u00a0when the levels of cortisol\u00a0in your body fall\u00a0significantly due to not taking your medicines, or during another illness.\nAn adrenal crisis is a medical emergency and warning signs include severe nausea, confusion, fever, headache and weakness. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you or someone you know has Addison\u2019s disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, dial 999 for an ambulance.\nRead more about treating Addison's disease\nInformation about you\nIf you have Addison's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register\n\n\nAddison's disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions.\nInitial symptoms of Addison's disease can\u00a0include:\n\nfatigue (lack of energy or motivation)\nlethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness)\nmuscle weakness\nlow mood (mild depression) or irritability\nloss of appetite and unintentional weight loss\nthe need to urinate frequently\nincreased thirst\ncraving for salty foods\n\nDehydration\u00a0can also be an early sign of Addison\u2019s disease. It's caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water.\nLater symptoms\nFurther\u00a0symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. However,\u00a0additional strees, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse.\nYou may go on to develop:\n\nlow blood pressure\u00a0when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting\u00a0\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\nabdominal,\u00a0joint or back pain\nmuscle cramps\u00a0\nchronic exhaustion, which may cause depression\nbrownish discolouration of the skin, lips\u00a0and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees\na\u00a0reduced libido (lack of interest in sex), particularly in women\n\nSome women may also have irregular periods\u00a0or miss some periods completely.\u00a0Children with Addison's disease may experience puberty\u00a0later than usual.\nSome people with Addison's disease also develop low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). This can cause symptoms such as\u00a0difficulty concentrating, confusion, anxiety and even unconsciousness (particularly in children).\nIf you're experiencing\u00a0symptoms of Addison's disease, see your GP so they can diagnose or rule out the condition.\u00a0These symptoms\u00a0will usually improve with\u00a0appropriate treatment.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing Addison's disease and treating Addison's disease\nAdrenal crisis\nIf Addison\u2019s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland\u00a0gradually decrease in the body. This causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation\u00a0called\u00a0an adrenal or Addisonian crisis.\nDuring an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease appear quickly and\u00a0severely. This could happen when\u00a0you're already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all.\nSigns of an adrenal crisis include:\n\nsevere dehydration\npale, cold, clammy skin\nsweating\nrapid, shallow breathing\ndizziness\nsevere vomiting and diarrhoea\nsevere muscle weakness\nheadache\nsevere drowsiness or loss of consciousness\n\nAn adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you think you or someone you know\u00a0with Addison\u2019s disease\u00a0is having an adrenal crisis, dial 999 for an ambulance.\nIf an adrenal crisis isn't treated, it can lead to a\u00a0coma and death. There's also a risk your brain won't get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which\u00a0can cause permanent disability.\n\n\nAddison's disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces.\nProblems with the immune system\nIn the UK, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of Addison's disease, accounting for 70-90% of cases.\nThe\u00a0immune system is your body\u2019s defence against infection and disease. If you're ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). These antibodies attack the cause of the illness.\nHowever, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. This is known as an autoimmune disorder.\nAddison\u2019s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. When 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won't be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Once levels of these start decreasing, you'll experience symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease.\nIt's not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families (see below).\nGenetics\nResearch has shown that some people with\u00a0certain genes\u00a0are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders.\nIt's not clear how these genes lead to Addison's disease\u00a0and\u00a0similar conditions, but it does mean\u00a0your risk of developing Addison's disease is increased if you or a\u00a0close family member\u00a0have another autoimmune condition, such as:\n\nvitiligo\u2013 a chronic (long-term) condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin\ntype 1 diabetes \u2013 a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood\u00a0\u00a0\nunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\u00a0\n\nOther causes\nTuberculosis (TB)\u00a0is the most common cause of Addison's disease worldwide, but is rare in the UK. TB is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body.\u00a0It can cause Addison\u2019s disease if it damages your adrenal glands.\nOther possible causes of Addison\u2019s disease include:\n\ninfections \u2013 such as those linked to AIDS, or fungal infections\na haemorrhage \u2013 very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with meningitis\u00a0or other types of severe sepsis\ncancer \u2013 if\u00a0cancer cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands\namyloidosis \u2013 a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them\nsurgical removal of\u00a0both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) \u2013 for example, to remove a tumour\nadrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) \u2013 a rare, life-limiting, inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain that\u00a0most often\u00a0affects young boys\ncertain treatments needed for Cushing's syndrome \u2013 a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the body\n\n\n\nTo help diagnose Addison\u2019s disease, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and review your medical history.\nThey're also likely to ask if anyone in your family has\u00a0an autoimmune disorder (a condition caused by a problem with their immune system).\nYour GP will examine your skin for any evidence of brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation), particularly in certain areas, such as:\n\nwhere skin creases on your palm\nin your elbow crease\non any scars\nyour lips and gums\n\nHowever, hyperpigmentation doesn't occur in all cases of Addison\u2019s disease.\nYou'll also be tested for\u00a0low blood pressure (hypotension) while you're lying down and again shortly after you stand up. This is to see whether you have postural or orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when you change position).\nBlood tests\nIf Addison\u2019s disease is suspected,\u00a0blood tests will be carried out to measure the levels of\u00a0sodium, potassium and cortisol\u00a0in your body. A low sodium, high potassium or low cortisol level may indicate\u00a0Addison\u2019s disease.\nYou may need to see a hospital hormone specialist (endocrinologist) for your blood\u00a0to be tested for the following:\n\na low level of the hormone aldosterone\na high level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)\na low level of glucose (sugar used for energy)\npositive adrenal antibodies (antibodies designed to attack the adrenal gland)\n\nAny of the above could be a sign of Addison\u2019s disease.\nSynacthen stimulation test\nIf cortisol\u00a0in your blood\u00a0is\u00a0low, or your symptoms strongly suggest Addison\u2019s disease, you'll need to have a synacthen stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis.\nYour GP may refer you to an endocrinology unit (a unit that specialises in the study of hormones) for the test. How urgently you're referred depends on how severe your symptoms are.\nSynacthen is a man-made (synthetic) copy of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is naturally produced by the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland below the brain) to encourage the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.\nWhen synacthen is administered, the adrenal glands should respond in the same way as they would to ACTH, and release cortisol and\u00a0other steroid hormones\u00a0into the blood.\nA blood sample will be taken and tested for cortisol, before an injection of\u00a0synacthen is given into your arm. After 30 and 60 minutes, a further\u00a0blood sample will be taken for cortisol measurement.\nIf the ACTH level is high, but the cortisol and aldosterone levels are low, it's usually confirmation of Addison\u2019s disease.\nThyroid function test\nAs well as a synacthen stimulation test, your thyroid gland may also be tested to see if it's working properly.\nYour thyroid gland is found in your neck. It produces hormones that control your body's growth and metabolism.\nPeople with Addison\u2019s disease often have an\u00a0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. By testing the levels of certain hormones in your blood, your endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone conditions) can determine whether you have hypothyroidism.\nScans\nIn some cases, your\u00a0specialist may refer you for a scan of your adrenal glands \u2013 this could be a\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan or a\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.\nDiagnosis during an adrenal crisis\nIf Addison\u2019s disease is left untreated, it eventually leads to an adrenal crisis. This is where\u00a0the\u00a0symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease appear quickly and severely.\nDuring an adrenal crisis, there's not enough time to perform a synacthen stimulation test to confirm Addison\u2019s disease.\nIf possible, blood will be taken and tested for any of the abnormalities listed above. While you're waiting for the results, treatment may be started with steroid injections, and fluids containing salt and glucose.\nRead more about treating\u00a0Addison\u2019s disease\nDriving\nIf you're diagnosed with Addison's disease and\u00a0have a bus, coach or lorry licence, it's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\nRead\u00a0about\u00a0driving and\u00a0Addison's disease\u00a0on the GOV.UK website.\n\n\nIf you have Addison\u2019s disease, you'll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. This should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue.\nIn\u00a0some cases, the underlying causes of Addison\u2019s disease can be treated. For example,\u00a0tuberculosis (TB) is treated with a course of\u00a0antibiotics over a period of at least six months.\nHowever, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can't be cured.\nMedication for\u00a0Addison\u2019s disease\nTreatment usually involves\u00a0corticosteroid (steroid) replacement therapy for life. Corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that\u00a0your body no longer produces.\u00a0It's usually taken in tablet form two or three times a day.\nIn most cases, a medication called\u00a0hydrocortisone\u00a0is used to replace the cortisol. Other possible medicines are\u00a0prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used.\u00a0\nAldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. Your GP may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you're taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this\u00a0may not be necessary.\u00a0Unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it.\nIn general, the medications used for Addison's disease don't have side effects, unless your dose is too high. If you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there's a risk of problems such as weakened bones (osteoporosis), mood swings and difficulty sleeping (insomnia).\nLiving with Addison\u2019s disease\nMany people with Addison\u2019s disease find\u00a0that taking their medication enables them to continue\u00a0with their\u00a0normal diet and exercise routines. However, bouts of fatigue are also common, and it can\u00a0take some time to learn how to manage these periods of low energy.\nSome people find that needing to take regular doses of medication is restrictive and affects their daily life or emotional health.\u00a0Missing a dose of medication, or taking it late,\u00a0can also lead to exhaustion or insomnia.\nSome people can develop associated health conditions, such as\u00a0diabetes or an underactive thyroid, which require extra treatment and management.\nYou'll usually need to have appointments with an endocrinologist every 6-12 months, so they can review your progress and adjust your medication dose, if necessary.\u00a0Your GP can provide support and repeat prescriptions in between these visits.\nFailing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so\u00a0you must:\n\nremember to collect your repeat prescriptions\nkeep spare medication as necessary \u2013 for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you\ntake your medication every day at the right time\npack extra medication if you are going away \u2013 usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below)\ncarry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary\n\nYou could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. Tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one.\nIt's also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that informs people\u00a0you have Addison\u2019s disease.\nAfter a serious accident, such as a car crash, a healthy person produces more\u00a0cortisol. This helps you cope with the stressful situation and additional strain on your body that results from serious injury. As your body cannot produce cortisol, you'll need a hydrocortisone injection to replace it and prevent an adrenal crisis.\nWearing a medical alert bracelet will inform any medical staff\u00a0treating you about your condition, and what medication you require.\nMedical alert bracelets or necklaces are pieces of jewellery engraved with your medical condition and an emergency contact number. They are available from a number of retailers. Ask your GP if there's one they recommend, or go to the\u00a0MedicAlert website.\u00a0\nIf you need to stay in hospital, the healthcare professionals responsible for your care will also need to know you need steroid replacement medication throughout your stay. It's important to note that this advice still applies if you're not supposed to eat or drink (nil by mouth) for any reason.\nAdjusting your medication\nAt certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. For example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following:\n\nan illness or infection \u2013 particularly if you have a high temperature of 37.5C (99.5F)\nan accident, such as a car crash\nan operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy)\nyou're taking part in strenuous exercise\u00a0not usually part of your daily life\n\nThis will help your body cope with the additional stress. Your endocrinologist will monitor your dosage and advise about any changes. Over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. However, always consult your GP or specialist if you're unsure.\nEmergency treatment\nYou and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency.\nThis could be necessary if you go into shock\u00a0after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. This may occur if you're pregnant and have morning sickness. Your\u00a0endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary.\nIf you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone, always call your GP immediately afterwards. Check what\u00a0out-of-hours services are available in your local area, in case the emergency is outside normal working hours.\nYou can also\u00a0register yourself with your local ambulance service, so they have a record of your requirement for a steroid injection or tablets, if you need their assistance.\nTreating adrenal crisis\nAdrenal crisis, or Addisonian crisis, needs urgent medical attention. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you know are experiencing adrenal crisis.\nSigns of an adrenal crisis include:\n\nsevere dehydration\npale, cold, clammy skin\nsweating\nrapid, shallow breathing\ndizziness\nsevere vomiting and diarrhoea\nsevere muscle weakness\nheadache\nsevere drowsiness or loss of consciousness\n\nIn hospital, you'll be given lots of fluid through a vein in your arm to rehydrate you. This will contain a mixture of salts and sugars (sodium, glucose and dextrose) to replace those that your body is lacking. You'll also be injected with hydrocortisone to replace the missing cortisol hormone.\nAny underlying causes of the adrenal crisis, such as an infection, will also be treated.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms.\nARLD\u00a0doesn't usually cause any symptoms until the liver has been severely damaged. When this happens, symptoms can include:\n\nfeeling sick\nweight loss\nloss of appetite\nyellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)\nswelling in the ankles\u00a0and tummy\nconfusion\u00a0or drowsiness\nvomiting blood or passing blood in your stools\n\nThis means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage.\nIf you\u00a0regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged.\nRead more about:\n\nsymptoms of ARLD\ndiagnosing ARLD\n\nAlcohol and the liver\nWith the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body.\u00a0Its functions include:\n\nfiltering toxins from the blood\naiding digestion of food\nregulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels\nhelping fight infection and disease\n\nThe liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die.\nThe liver can develop new cells, but prolonged\u00a0alcohol misuse\u00a0(drinking too much)\u00a0over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can\u00a0result in serious and\u00a0permanent damage to your liver.\nARLD is\u00a0very common in the UK\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades\u00a0as a result of\u00a0increasing levels of alcohol misuse.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of ARLD.\nStages of ARLD\nThere are 3\u00a0main stages of\u00a0ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage.\u00a0These stages are explained below.\nAlcoholic fatty liver disease\nDrinking a large amount\u00a0of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is\u00a0called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD.\nFatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level.\nFatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for 2\u00a0weeks, your liver should return to normal.\nAlcoholic hepatitis\nAlcoholic\u00a0hepatitis\u00a0\u2013 which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol.\nLess commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking).\nThe liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently.\nSevere alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious\u00a0and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.\nCirrhosis\nCirrhosis\u00a0is a stage of\u00a0ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred.\u00a0Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms.\nIt's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy.\nA person who has\u00a0alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn't stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5\u00a0more years.\nHow ARLD is treated\nThere's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of\u00a0further damage to your liver and\u00a0gives\u00a0it the best chance of recovering.\nIf\u00a0a person is\u00a0dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol\u00a0support services.\nA\u00a0liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn't improve when you stop drinking alcohol.\nYou'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you've developed complications of\u00a0cirrhosis, despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of\u00a0their life.\nRead more about\u00a0treating ARLD.\nComplications\nDeath rates linked to ARLD have\u00a0risen considerably over the last\u00a0few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with\u00a0smoking and high blood pressure.\nLife-threatening complications of ARLD include:\n\ninternal (variceal) bleeding\nbuild-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy)\nfluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure\nliver cancer\n\nRead more about the complications of ARLD.\nPreventing ARLD\nThe most effective way to prevent\u00a0ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits:\n\nmen and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week\nspread your drinking over 3\u00a0days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week\n\nA unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits.\nEven if you've been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits\u00a0for your liver and overall health.\nSee our\u00a0drinking and alcohol\u00a0pages for more information and advice.\n\n\nIn many cases, people with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) don't have any noticeable symptoms until their liver is badly damaged.\nEarly symptoms\nIf you do experience early symptoms of ARLD, these\u00a0are often quite vague, such as:\n\nabdominal pain\nloss of appetite\nfatigue\nfeeling sick\ndiarrhoea\nfeeling generally unwell\n\nAdvanced symptoms\nAs\u00a0the liver becomes more severely damaged, more obvious and serious symptoms can develop, such as:\n\nyellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nswelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to\u00a0a build-up of fluid (oedema)\nswelling in your abdomen, due to\u00a0a build-up of fluid known as ascites\na high temperature (fever)\u00a0and shivering attacks\nvery itchy skin\nhair loss\nunusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers)\nblotchy red\u00a0palms\nsignificant weight loss\nweakness and muscle wasting\nconfusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping (insomnia) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain\nvomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to\u00a0internal bleeding\na tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent\u00a0nosebleeds and bleeding gums\nincreased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can't process them)\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nARLD\u00a0doesn't often cause symptoms until it's reached an advanced stage. If you misuse alcohol, you may have liver damage, even though you have none of the symptoms above.\nRead about alcohol misuse (drinking too much).\u00a0\nContact your GP for advice\u00a0if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse.\nA good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the CAGE test, which consists of 4\u00a0questions:\n\nHave you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking?\nHave people annoyed you by criticising your drinking?\nHave you ever felt guilty about your drinking?\nHave you ever drunk an \"eye-opener\", which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves?\n\nIf you answer \"yes\" to 1\u00a0or more of the questions above, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your GP.\nSee your GP as soon as possible\u00a0if you have symptoms of advanced ARLD.\nRead more about how ARLD is diagnosed.\n\n\nAlcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is caused by drinking too much alcohol. The more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing ARLD.\nThere are 2\u00a0ways alcohol misuse\u00a0(drinking too much)\u00a0can cause ARLD. These are:\n\ndrinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time (binge drinking) can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis\ndrinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause\u00a0hepatitis and cirrhosis, the more serious types of ARLD\n\nEvidence suggests people who\u00a0regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing ARLD:\n\nmen and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week\nspread your drinking over 3\u00a0days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week\n\nRead more about alcohol units and how to calculate them.\nAdditional factors\nAs well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing ARLD. These\u00a0include:\n\nbeing overweight or obese\nbeing female\u00a0\u2013\u00a0women appear to be more vulnerable than men to the harmful effects of alcohol\nhaving a pre-existing liver condition, such as\u00a0hepatitis C\u00a0\ngenetics\u00a0\u2013\u00a0alcohol dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in families\n\n\n\nAlcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver.\nThis is because\u00a0the condition\u00a0causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages.\nIf a doctor suspects ARLD, they'll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. They may also ask about your alcohol consumption.\nIt's important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol to avoid further unnecessary testing. This could lead to a delay in the treatment you need.\nBlood tests\nBlood tests\u00a0used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. However, liver function tests can be normal\u00a0at many stages of liver disease.\nBlood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. A low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn't functioning properly.\nA blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage.\nLab Tests Online has more information on\u00a0liver function tests.\nFurther testing\nIf your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of ARLD \u2013 either\u00a0alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis \u2013 you may need further tests. These are described below.\nImaging tests\nScans may be needed to\u00a0produce detailed images of your liver. This may include:\n\nan ultrasound scan\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n\nSome scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred.\nLiver biopsy\nDuring a liver\u00a0biopsy,\u00a0a\u00a0fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). A small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope.\nThe\u00a0biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital.\nSpecialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage.\nEndoscopy\nAn endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end.\u00a0During an endoscopy,\u00a0the instrument is\u00a0passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach.\nPictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. The doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis.\n\n\nSuccessful treatment for alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) often depends on whether someone is willing to stop drinking alcohol and make changes to their lifestyle.\nStopping drinking\u00a0alcohol\nTreatment for\u00a0ARLD involves stopping drinking alcohol. This is known as abstinence, which can be vital, depending on what stage the condition is at.\nIf you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least 2\u00a0weeks. After this point, it's usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the\u00a0NHS guidelines on alcohol consumption.\nIf you have a more serious form of ARLD \u2013 alcoholic hepatitis\u00a0or cirrhosis \u2013 life-long abstinence is recommended.\u00a0This is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease.\nStopping drinking isn't easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with ARLD have an alcohol dependency problem.\nNevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and don't stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure.\nWithdrawal symptoms\nIf you're abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. These will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. This usually takes 3\u00a0to 7\u00a0days from the time of your last drink.\nMany people initially experience\u00a0disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but\u00a0in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month.\nIn some cases,\u00a0you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. You may also be offered\u00a0a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to help you through the withdrawal process.\nSome people\u00a0need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so\u00a0their\u00a0progress can be closely monitored.\nIf you're\u00a0staying at home, you'll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. You might see them at home, at your GP surgery or at a specialist NHS service.\nPreventing relapses\nOnce you've stopped\u00a0drinking, you may\u00a0need further\u00a0treatment to help ensure you don't\u00a0start drinking again.\nThe first treatment usually offered\u00a0is psychological therapy. This involves\u00a0seeing a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing.\nIf psychological therapy alone isn't effective, you may also need medication to help you abstain from alcohol, such as:\u00a0\n\nacamprosate\nnaltrexone\ndisulfiram\n\nRead our page on\u00a0treating alcohol misuse\u00a0for\u00a0more information on the treatments offered.\nSelf-help groups\nMany people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. One of the most well-known is Alcoholics Anonymous, but there are\u00a0many other groups that can help.\nSee\u00a0alcohol support\u00a0for more information about the help available.\nDiet and nutrition\nMalnutrition\u00a0is common in people with ARLD, so it's important to eat a\u00a0balanced diet to help ensure you get all the nutrients you need.\nAvoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid.\u00a0\nThe damage to your liver can also mean it's unable to store glycogen \u2013 a\u00a0carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet.\nHealthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0small meals a day, rather than 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0large meals.\nYour GP can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian.\nIn the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube\u00a0inserted through the nose and into the stomach.\nMedication\u00a0for\u00a0symptoms\nThe use of medication to directly\u00a0treat\u00a0ARLD is controversial. Many experts have argued\u00a0there's limited evidence for its effectiveness.\nFor people with severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment in hospital may be necessary. Specific treatment with\u00a0corticosteroids\u00a0or pentoxifylline medication may be used to reduce inflammation of the liver in some people with this condition.\nNutritional support (see above) is also an important part of treatment in these cases.\nOther medications that have been used to treat liver damage include:\n\nanabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication)\nropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treat overactive thyroid glands)\n\nHowever, there's a lack of good evidence that these help and they're no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis.\nLiver transplants\nIn the most serious cases of ARLD, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to\u00a0liver failure. A\u00a0liver transplant\u00a0is currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure.\nA liver transplant may be considered if:\n\nyou develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol\nyou're otherwise well enough to survive such an operation\nyou commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your life\n\n\n\nA number of serious complications can develop if you have alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD).\nSome of the main complications associated with the condition are described below.\nPortal hypertension and varices\nPortal hypertension is a common complication of\u00a0cirrhosis and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis.\u00a0It occurs when\u00a0the blood pressure inside your liver has risen to a potentially serious level.\nWhen the liver becomes severely scarred, it's harder for blood to move through it. This leads to an increase in the pressure of blood around the intestines.\nThe blood must also find a new way to return to your heart. It does this by opening up new blood vessels, usually along the lining of your stomach or oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These new blood vessels are known as varices.\nIf the blood pressure rises to a certain level, it can become too high for the varices to cope with, causing the\u00a0walls\u00a0of the varices\u00a0to split and bleed.\nThis can cause long-term bleeding, which can lead to\u00a0anaemia.\nAlternatively, the bleeding can be rapid and massive, causing you to vomit blood and pass stools that are very dark or tar-like.\nSplit varices can be treated by using an\u00a0endoscope to locate the varices. A tiny band can then be used to seal the base of the varices.\nAscites\nA person with portal hypertension may also develop a build-up of fluid in their abdomen (tummy) and around\u00a0the intestines. This fluid is known as ascites.\nInitially, this can be treated with water tablets (diuretics). If the problem progresses, many litres of fluid can build up, which needs to be drained. This is a procedure known as paracentesis and involves a long, thin tube being placed into the fluid through the skin under local anaesthetic.\nOne of the problems associated with the development of ascites is the risk of infection in the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). This is a potentially very serious complication and is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure and death.\nHepatic encephalopathy\nOne of the most important functions of the liver is to remove toxins from your blood. If\u00a0the liver is unable to do this due to hepatitis or cirrhosis, the levels of toxins in the\u00a0blood increase. A high level of toxins in the blood due to liver damage is known as hepatic encephalopathy.\nSymptoms of hepatic encephalopathy include:\n\nagitation\nconfusion\ndisorientation\nmuscle stiffness\nmuscle tremors\ndifficulty speaking\nin very serious cases, a\u00a0coma\n\nHepatic encephalopathy\u00a0may require hospital admission. In hospital, body functions are supported and medication is used to remove toxins from the blood.\nLiver cancer\nLiver damage due to heavy drinking over many years can also increase your risk of developing\u00a0liver cancer.\nOver the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen sharply due to increased levels of alcohol misuse. It's estimated that, every year, 3-5% of people with\u00a0cirrhosis will develop liver cancer.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Allergic rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose caused by an allergen, such as pollen, dust, mould, or flakes of skin from certain animals.\nIt's a very common condition, estimated to affect around one in every five people in the UK.\nSigns and symptoms\nAllergic rhinitis\u00a0typically\u00a0causes cold-like symptoms, such as sneezing, itchiness and a blocked or runny nose. These symptoms usually\u00a0start soon after being\u00a0exposed to an allergen.\nSome people only\u00a0get allergic rhinitis\u00a0for a few months at a time because they're sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as\u00a0tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round.\nMost people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily and effectively treated. But for some symptoms can be severe and persistent, causing sleep problems and interfering with everyday life.\nThe symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and\u00a0it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely.\nWhen to see your GP\nVisit your GP if the symptoms of allergic rhinitis are disrupting your sleep, preventing you carrying out everyday activities, or adversely affecting your performance at work or school.\nA diagnosis of allergic rhinitis will usually be based on your symptoms and any possible triggers you may have noticed. If the cause of your condition is uncertain, you may be referred for allergy testing.\nRead more about diagnosing allergic rhinitis\nWhat causes allergic rhinitis?\nAllergic rhinitis is caused by the\u00a0immune system reacting to an allergen as if\u00a0it\u00a0were harmful.\nThis\u00a0results\u00a0in\u00a0cells releasing a number of chemicals that cause\u00a0the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become swollen and excessive levels of mucus to be produced.\nCommon\u00a0allergens that cause allergic rhinitis include pollen\u00a0\u2013 this type of allergic rhinitis is known as hay fever\u00a0\u2013 as well as\u00a0mould spores, house dust mites, and\u00a0flakes of skin or droplets of urine or\u00a0saliva from certain\u00a0animals.\nRead more about the causes of allergic rhinitis\nTreating and preventing allergic rhinitis\nIt's difficult to completely avoid potential allergens, but you can take steps to reduce exposure to a particular allergen you know or suspect is triggering your allergic rhinitis. This will help improve your symptoms.\nIf\u00a0your condition is mild, you can also help reduce the symptoms by taking over-the-counter medications, such as non-sedating antihistamines, and by regularly rinsing your nasal passages with a salt water solution to keep your nose free of irritants.\nSee your GP for advice if you've tried taking\u00a0these steps and they haven't helped. They may prescribe a stronger medication, such as a nasal spray containing corticosteroids.\nRead more about treating allergic rhinitis\u00a0and preventing allergic rhinitis\nFurther problems\nAllergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include:\n\nnasal polyps \u2013 abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) sacs of fluid that grow inside the nasal passages and sinuses\nsinusitis \u2013 an infection caused by nasal inflammation and swelling that prevents mucus draining from the sinuses\nmiddle ear infections \u2013 infection of part of the ear located directly behind the eardrum\n\nThese problems can often be treated with medication, although surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases.\nRead more about the complications of allergic rhinitis\n\n\nAllergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction to an allergen, such as pollen, dust and certain animals.\nOversensitive immune system\nIf you have allergic rhinitis, your immune system\u00a0\u2013 your natural defence against infection and illness\u00a0\u2013\u00a0will react to an allergen as if it were harmful.\nIf your immune system is oversensitive, it will react to allergens by producing antibodies to fight them off. Antibodies are special proteins in the blood that are usually produced to fight viruses and infections.\nAllergic reactions don't occur the first time you come into contact with an allergen. The immune system has to recognise and \"memorise\" it before producing antibodies to fight\u00a0it. This process is\u00a0known as sensitisation.\nAfter you develop sensitivity to an allergen, it will be detected by antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE)\u00a0whenever\u00a0it comes into contact with the inside of your nose and throat.\nThese antibodies cause cells to release a number of chemicals, including histamine, which can cause\u00a0the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become inflamed and produce excess mucus. This is what causes the typical symptoms of sneezing and a blocked or runny nose.\nCommon allergens\nAllergic rhinitis is triggered by breathing in tiny particles of allergens. The most common airborne allergens that cause rhinitis are described below.\nHouse dust mites are tiny insects that feed on the dead flakes of human skin. They can be found in mattresses, carpets, soft furniture, pillows and beds.\nRhinitis isn't caused by the dust mites themselves, but by\u00a0a chemical found in their excrement. Dust mites\u00a0are present all year round, although their numbers tend to peak during the winter.\nTiny particles of pollen produced by trees and grasses can sometimes cause allergic rhinitis. Most trees pollinate\u00a0from early to mid-spring, whereas grasses pollinate at the end of spring and beginning of summer.\nRhinitis can also be caused by spores produced by mould and fungi.\nMany people are allergic to animals, such as cats and dogs. The allergic reaction isn't caused by animal fur, but flakes of dead animal skin and\u00a0their urine and saliva.\nDogs and cats are the most common culprits, although some people are affected by horses, cattle, rabbits and rodents, such as guinea pigs and hamsters.\nHowever,\u00a0being around dogs from an early age can help protect against allergies, and there's some evidence to suggest that this might also be the case with cats.\nSome people are affected by allergens found in their work environment, such as wood dust, flour dust or latex.\nWho's most at risk?\nIt isn't fully understood why some people become oversensitive to allergens, although you're more likely to develop an allergy\u00a0if there's a history of allergies in your family.\nIf this is the case, you're said to be \"atopic\", or to have \"atopy\". People who are atopic\u00a0have a genetic tendency to develop allergic conditions. Their increased immune response to allergens results in increased production of IgE antibodies.\u00a0\nEnvironmental factors may also play a\u00a0part. Studies have shown certain things may\u00a0increase the chance of a child developing allergies, such as growing up in a house where people smoke and being exposed to\u00a0dust mites at a young age.\n\n\nYour GP will often be able to diagnose allergic rhinitis from your symptoms and your personal and family medical history.\nThey'll ask you whether you've noticed\u00a0any triggers that seem to cause a reaction, and whether it happens at a particular place or time.\nYour GP may examine the inside of your nose to check for nasal polyps.\nNasal polyps are fleshy swellings that grow from the lining of your nose or your sinuses, the small cavities inside your nose. They can be caused by the inflammation that occurs as a result of allergic rhinitis.\nAllergic rhinitis is usually confirmed when medical treatment starts. If you respond well to antihistamines, it's almost certain that your symptoms are caused by an allergy.\nAllergy testing\nIf the exact cause of allergic rhinitis is uncertain, your GP may refer you to a hospital allergy clinic for allergy testing.\nThe two main allergy tests are:\n\nskin prick test \u2013\u00a0where the allergen is placed on your arm and the surface of the skin\u00a0is pricked with a needle to\u00a0introduce the allergen to your immune system; if you're allergic to the substance,\u00a0a small itchy spot (welt) will appear\nblood test \u2013\u00a0to check for the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody in your blood; your immune system produces this antibody\u00a0in response to a suspected allergen\n\nCommercial allergy testing kits\u00a0aren't recommended because the testing is often of a lower standard than that provided by the NHS or an accredited private clinic.\nIt's also\u00a0important that the test results are interpreted by a qualified healthcare professional with detailed knowledge of your symptoms and medical history.\nFurther tests\nIn some cases further\u00a0hospital tests may be needed to check for complications, such as nasal polyps or sinusitis.\nFor example, you may need:\n\na nasal endoscopy\u00a0\u2013 where a\u00a0thin tube with a light source and video camera at one end (endoscope) is inserted up your nose so your doctor can see inside your nose\na nasal inspiratory flow test \u2013 where a small device is placed over your mouth and nose to\u00a0measure the air flow when you inhale through your nose\na computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 a scan that uses\u00a0X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body\n\n\n\nTreatment for allergic rhinitis depends on how severe your symptoms are and how much they're affecting your everyday activities.\nIn most cases treatment aims to relieve symptoms such as sneezing and a blocked or runny nose.\nIf you have mild allergic rhinitis, you can often treat the symptoms yourself.\u00a0\nYou should visit your GP if your symptoms are more severe and affecting your quality of life,\u00a0or if self-help measures haven't been effective.\nSelf-help\nIt's possible to treat the symptoms of mild allergic rhinitis with over-the-counter medications, such as long-acting, non-sedating antihistamines.\nIf possible, try to reduce exposure to the allergen that triggers the condition. See preventing allergic rhinitis for more information and advice about this.\nRegularly cleaning your nasal passages with a salt water solution\u00a0\u2013 known as nasal douching or irrigation\u00a0\u2013 can also help by keeping your nose free of irritants.\nYou can do this either by using a homemade solution or a solution made with sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy.\nSmall syringes or pots that often look like small horns or teapots are also available to help flush the solution around the inside of your nose.\nTo make the solution at home, mix half a teaspoon of salt and\u00a0half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda (baking powder) into a pint (568ml) of boiled water that's been left to cool to around body temperature\u00a0\u2013\u00a0do not attempt to rinse your nose while the water is still hot.\nTo rinse your nose:\n\nstand over a sink, cup the palm of one hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it\nsniff the water into one nostril at a time\nrepeat this until your nose feels comfortable\u00a0\u2013 you may not need to use all of the solution\n\nWhile you do this, some solution may pass into your throat through the back of your nose. The solution is harmless if swallowed, but try to spit out as much of it as possible.\nNasal irrigation can be carried out as often as necessary, but a fresh solution should be made each time.\nMedication\nMedication won't cure your allergy, but it can be used to treat the common symptoms.\nIf your symptoms are caused by seasonal allergens, such as pollen, you should be able to stop taking your medication after the risk of exposure has passed.\nVisit\u00a0your GP if your symptoms don't respond to medication after two weeks.\nAntihistamines relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis by blocking the action of a chemical called histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it's under attack from an allergen.\nYou can buy antihistamine tablets over the counter from your pharmacist without a prescription, but antihistamine nasal sprays are only available with a prescription.\nAntihistamines can sometimes\u00a0cause drowsiness. If you're taking them for the first time, see how you react to them before driving or operating heavy machinery. In particular, antihistamines can cause drowsiness if you drink alcohol while taking them.\nIf you have frequent or persistent\u00a0symptoms and you have a nasal blockage or nasal polyps, your GP may recommend a nasal spray or drops containing corticosteroids.\nCorticosteroids help reduce inflammation and swelling. They take longer to work than antihistamines, but their effects last longer. Side effects from inhaled corticosteroids are rare, but can include nasal dryness, irritation and nosebleeds.\nIf you\u00a0have a particularly severe bout of symptoms and need rapid relief, your GP\u00a0may prescribe a short course of corticosteroid tablets lasting\u00a05 to 10 days.\nIf allergic rhinitis doesn't respond to treatment,\u00a0your GP\u00a0may choose to\u00a0add to your original treatment.\u00a0\nThey may\u00a0suggest:\n\nincreasing the dose of your corticosteroid nasal spray\nusing a short-term course of a decongestant nasal spray to take with your other medication\ncombining antihistamine tablets with corticosteroid nasal sprays, and possibly decongestants\nusing a nasal spray\u00a0that contains a medicine called ipratropium, which will help reduce excessive nasal discharge\nusing a leukotriene receptor antagonist medication \u2013 medication that blocks the effects of chemicals called\u00a0leukotrienes, which are released during an allergic reaction\n\nIf you don't respond to the add-on treatments, you may be referred to a specialist for further assessment and treatment.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy, also known as hyposensitisation or desensitisation,\u00a0is another type\u00a0of treatment used for some allergies.\nIt's only suitable for people with certain types of allergies, such as hay fever, and\u00a0is\u00a0usually only considered if your symptoms\u00a0are severe.\nImmunotherapy involves\u00a0gradually introducing more and more of the allergen into your body to make\u00a0your immune system\u00a0less sensitive to it.\nThe allergen is\u00a0often injected under the skin of your upper arm. Injections are given at weekly intervals, with a slightly increased dose each time.\nImmunotherapy can also be carried out\u00a0using tablets that contain\u00a0an allergen, such as grass pollen, which\u00a0are\u00a0placed under your tongue.\nWhen a dose is reached that's effective\u00a0in reducing your allergic reaction (the maintenance dose), you'll need to continue with the injections or tablets for up to three\u00a0years.\nImmunotherapy should only be carried out under the close supervision of a specially trained doctor as there's a risk it may cause a serious allergic reaction.\n\n\nIf you have allergic rhinitis, there's a risk you could develop further problems.\nA\u00a0blocked or runny nose can result in difficulty sleeping, drowsiness during the daytime, irritability and problems concentrating. Allergic rhinitis can also make\u00a0symptoms of asthma worse.\nThe inflammation associated with allergic rhinitis can also sometimes lead to other conditions, such as nasal polyps,\u00a0sinusitis and middle ear infections. These are described below.\nNasal polyps\nNasal polyps are swellings that grow in the lining inside your nose or sinuses, the small cavities above and behind your nose.\nThey're caused by inflammation of the membranes of the nose and sometimes develop as a result of rhinitis.\nNasal polyps are shaped like teardrops when they're growing and look like a grape on a stem when fully grown.\nThey vary in size and can be yellow, grey or pink. They can grow on their own or in clusters, and usually affect both nostrils.\nIf nasal polyps grow large enough, or in clusters, they can interfere with your breathing, reduce your sense of smell\u00a0and block your sinuses, which can\u00a0lead to sinusitis.\nSmall nasal polyps can be shrunk using steroid nasal sprays so they don't cause an obstruction in your nose. Large polyps may need to be surgically removed.\nSinusitis\nSinusitis is a common complication of rhinitis. It's where the sinuses become inflamed or infected.\nThe sinuses naturally produce mucus, which usually drains into your nose through small channels.\nHowever, if the drainage channels are inflamed or blocked\u00a0\u2013 for example, because of rhinitis or nasal polyps\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the mucus can't drain away and it may become infected.\nCommon symptoms of sinusitis include:\n\na blocked nose, making it difficult to breathe through your nose\na runny nose\nmucus that drips from the back of your nose down your throat (post-nasal drip)\na\u00a0reduced sense of smell or taste\na feeling of fullness,\u00a0pressure or pain\u00a0in the face\u00a0\nsnoring\nobstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)\u00a0\u2013 your airways become temporarily blocked while you're asleep, which can disturb your sleep\n\nOver-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin, can be used to help reduce any pain and discomfort in your face.\nHowever, these medications aren't suitable for everyone, so check the leaflet that comes with them before using them.\nFor example, children under the age of\u00a016 shouldn't take aspirin, and ibuprofen isn't recommended for people with asthma or a history of stomach ulcers. Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you're unsure.\nAntibiotics may also be recommended if your sinuses become infected with bacteria. If you have long-term (chronic) sinusitis, surgery may be needed to improve the drainage of your sinuses.\nRead more about treating sinusitis\nMiddle ear infections\nMiddle ear infections (otitis media) can also develop as a complication of nasal problems, including allergic rhinitis.\nThese infections can occur if rhinitis causes a problem with the Eustachian tube, which connects the back of the nose and middle ear, at the back of the nose.\nIf this tube\u00a0doesn't function properly, fluid can build up in the middle ear behind the ear drum and\u00a0can become infected.\nThere's also the possibility of infection at the back of the nose spreading to the ear through the Eustachian tube.\nThe main\u00a0symptoms of a middle ear infection include:\n\nearache\na high temperature (fever)\nbeing sick\na lack of energy\nslight hearing loss\n\nEar infections often clear up within a couple of days, but\u00a0paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to help relieve fever and pain. Antibiotics may also be prescribed if the symptoms persist or are particularly severe.\nRead more about treating middle ear infections\n\n\nThe best way to prevent allergic rhinitis is to avoid the allergen that causes it.\nBut\u00a0this isn't always easy. Allergens, such as dust mites, aren't always easy to spot and can breed in even the cleanest house.\nIt can also be difficult to avoid coming into contact with pets, particularly if they belong to friends and family.\nBelow is some advice to help you\u00a0avoid the most common allergens.\nHouse dust mites\nDust mites are one of the biggest causes of allergies. They're microscopic insects that breed in household dust.\nTo help limit the number\u00a0of mites in your house, you should:\n\nconsider buying an air-permeable occlusive mattress and bedding covers\u00a0\u2013 this type of bedding acts as a barrier to dust mites and their droppings\nchoose wood or hard vinyl floor coverings instead of\u00a0carpet\nfit roller blinds that can be easily wiped clean\nregularly clean cushions, soft toys, curtains and upholstered furniture, either by washing or vacuuming them\nuse synthetic pillows and acrylic duvets instead of woollen blankets or feather bedding\nuse a vacuum cleaner fitted with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA)\u00a0filter\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it can remove more dust than ordinary vacuum cleaners\nuse\u00a0a clean damp cloth to wipe surfaces\u00a0\u2013 dry dusting can spread allergens further\n\nConcentrate your efforts on controlling dust mites in the areas of your home where you spend most time, such as the bedroom and living room.\nPets\nIt isn't pet fur that causes an allergic reaction, but exposure to flakes of their dead skin, saliva and dried urine.\nIf you can't permanently remove a pet from the house, you may find the following tips useful:\n\nkeep pets outside as much as possible or limit them to one room, preferably one without carpet\ndon't allow pets in bedrooms\nwash pets at least once a fortnight\ngroom dogs regularly outside\nregularly wash bedding and soft furnishings\u00a0your pet has been on\n\nIf you're visiting a friend or relative with a pet, ask them not to dust or vacuum on the day you're visiting because it will disturb allergens into the air.\nTaking an\u00a0antihistamine medicine one hour before you enter a house with a pet can help reduce your symptoms.\nPollen\nDifferent plants and trees pollinate at different times of the year, so when you get allergic rhinitis will depend on what sort of pollen(s) you're allergic to.\nMost\u00a0people are affected during the spring and summer months because this is when most trees and plants pollinate.\nTo avoid exposure to pollen, you may find the following tips useful:\n\ncheck weather reports for the pollen count and stay indoors when it's high\navoid line-drying clothes and bedding when the pollen count is high\nwear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes from pollen\nkeep doors and windows shut during mid-morning and early evening, when there's most pollen in the air\nshower, wash your hair and change your clothes after being outside\navoid grassy areas, such as parks and fields, when possible\u00a0\nif you have a lawn, consider asking someone else to cut the grass for you\u00a0\n\nMould spores\nMoulds can grow on any decaying matter, both in and outside the house. The moulds themselves aren't allergens, but the spores they release are.\nSpores are released when there's a sudden rise in temperature in a moist environment, such as when central heating is turned on in a damp house or wet clothes are dried next to a fireplace.\nTo help\u00a0prevent mould spores, you should:\n\nkeep your home dry and well ventilated\nwhen showering or cooking, open windows but keep internal doors closed to prevent damp air spreading through the house, and use extractor fans\navoid drying clothes indoors, storing clothes in damp cupboards and\u00a0packing clothes too tightly in wardrobes\ndeal with any damp and condensation in your home\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "An allergy is a reaction the body has to a particular food or substance.\nAllergies are very common. They're thought to\u00a0affect more than 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0people in the UK at some point in their lives.\nThey\u00a0are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although\u00a0many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren't previously allergic to.\nHaving an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon.\nCommon allergies\nSubstances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens.\u00a0The more common allergens\u00a0include:\n\ngrass and tree pollen\u00a0\u2013 an allergy to these\u00a0is known as hay fever (allergic rhinitis)\ndust mites\nanimal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair)\nfood\u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow's milk\ninsect bites and stings\nmedication \u2013\u00a0including\u00a0ibuprofen, aspirin, and certain\u00a0antibiotics\nlatex\u00a0\u2013 used to make\u00a0some gloves and condoms\nmould\u00a0\u2013 these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in\nhousehold chemicals\u00a0\u2013 including those in detergents and hair dyes\n\nMost of these\u00a0allergens\u00a0are generally harmless to people who aren't allergic to them.\nSymptoms of an allergic reaction\nAllergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen.\nThey can cause:\n\nsneezing\na runny or blocked\u00a0nose\nred, itchy, watery eyes\nwheezing and coughing\na red, itchy rash\nworsening of\u00a0asthma or\u00a0eczema symptoms\n\nMost allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is\u00a0a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment.\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of allergies.\nWhen to get professional advice\nIf you have allergies you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory.\nGetting help for allergies\nIf your pharmacist thinks you might have a\u00a0mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. See your pharmacist if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. The symptoms of an allergic reaction\u00a0can also\u00a0be caused by other conditions. Your pharmacist can help determine whether it's likely you have an allergy.\nIf your allergy is particularly severe or it's not clear what you're allergic to, the pharmacist may advise you see your GP\u00a0who may refer you to an allergy specialist for testing and advice about treatment.\nRead more about\u00a0allergy testing.\nHow to manage an allergy\nIn\u00a0many cases, the most effective way of managing\u00a0an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible.\nFor example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food's ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more information about food allergen labelling.\nThere are also several medications available to\u00a0help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including:\n\nantihistamines\u00a0\u2013 these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring\ndecongestants\u00a0\u2013 tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose\nlotions and creams, such as\u00a0moisturising creams (emollients)\u00a0\u2013 these can\u00a0reduce skin redness and itchiness\nsteroid medication\u00a0\u2013 sprays, drops, creams, inhalers and tablets that can help reduce redness and swelling caused by an allergic reaction\n\nFor some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended.\nThis involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn't react to it so severely.\nRead more about\u00a0treating an allergy and avoiding allergic reactions.\nWhat causes allergies?\nAllergies\u00a0occur when the body's immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it's harmful.\nIt's not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema.\nThe number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it's the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with.\nIt's thought this may\u00a0cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances.\n\n\nSymptoms of an allergic reaction usually develop within a few minutes of being exposed to something you're allergic to, although occasionally they can develop gradually over a few hours.\nAlthough\u00a0allergic reactions\u00a0can be a nuisance and hamper your normal activities, most are mild. Very occasionally, a severe reaction called anaphylaxis can occur.\nMain\u00a0allergy symptoms\nCommon symptoms of an allergic reaction include:\n\nsneezing and an itchy, runny or blocked nose (allergic rhinitis)\nitchy, red, watering eyes (conjunctivitis)\nwheezing,\u00a0chest tightness, shortness of breath\u00a0and a cough\na raised, itchy, red rash (hives)\nswollen\u00a0lips, tongue, eyes\u00a0or face\ntummy pain, feeling sick, vomiting\u00a0or diarrhoea\ndry, red and cracked skin\n\nThe symptoms vary depending on what you're allergic to and how you come into contact with it. For example, you\u00a0may\u00a0have a runny nose\u00a0if exposed to pollen, develop\u00a0a rash if you have a skin allergy, or feel sick\u00a0if you eat something you're allergic to.\nSee your pharmacist if you or your child might have had an allergic\u00a0reaction to something. They can help determine whether the symptoms are caused by an allergy or another condition. Read more about diagnosing allergies.\nSevere allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)\nIn rare cases, an allergy can lead to a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock, which can be life-threatening.\nThis affects the whole body and usually\u00a0develops within minutes of exposure to something you're allergic to.\nSigns of anaphylaxis include any of the symptoms above, as well as:\n\nswelling of the throat and mouth\ndifficulty breathing\nlightheadedness\nconfusion\nblue skin or lips\ncollapsing and losing consciousness\n\nAnaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Read more about\u00a0anaphylaxis for information about what to do if it occurs.\n\n\nIf you think you have an allergy, tell your pharmacist about the symptoms you're having, when they happen, how often they occur and if anything seems to trigger them. Your pharmacist can offer advice and treatment for mild allergies with a clear cause.\nIf your allergy is more severe or it's not obvious what you're allergic to, your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP as you may need referred\u00a0for allergy testing at a specialist allergy clinic.\nThe tests that may be carried out are described below.\nSkin prick testing\nSkin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests.\nIt involves putting a drop of liquid onto your forearm that contains a substance you may be allergic to. The skin under the drop is then gently pricked with a needle. If you are allergic to the substance, an itchy, red bump will appear within 15 minutes.\nSkin prick testing is painless and very safe. Make sure you don't take antihistamines before the test, as they can interfere with the results.\nBlood tests\nBlood tests may be used instead of, or alongside, skin prick tests to help diagnose common allergies.\nA sample of your blood is removed and analysed for specific antibodies produced by your immune system in response to an allergen.\nPatch tests\nPatch\u00a0tests\u00a0are used to investigate a type of eczema known as contact dermatitis, which can be caused by your skin being exposed to an allergen.\nA small amount of the suspected allergen is added to special metal discs, which are then taped to your skin for 48 hours and monitored for a reaction.\nElimination diet\nIf you have a suspected\u00a0food allergy, you may be advised to avoid eating a particular food to see if your symptoms improve.\nAfter a few weeks, you may then be asked to eat the food again to check if you have another reaction.\nDon't attempt to do this\u00a0yourself without discussing it with a qualified healthcare professional.\nChallenge testing\nIn a few cases, a test called a\u00a0food challenge may also be used\u00a0to diagnose a food allergy.\nDuring the test, you're given the food you think you're allergic to in gradually increasing amounts, to see how you react under close supervision.\nThis test is riskier than other forms of testing, as it could cause a severe reaction, but is the most accurate way to diagnose food allergies. And challenge testing is always carried out in a clinic where a severe reaction can be treated if it does develop.\n\n\nThe treatment for an allergy depends on what you're allergic to. In many cases your pharmacist will be able to offer advice and treatment.\nThey'll advise you about taking steps to avoid exposure to the substance you're allergic to, and\u00a0can recommend medication to control your symptoms.\nAvoiding exposure to allergens\nThe best way to keep your symptoms under control is often to avoid the things you're allergic to,\u00a0although this isn't always practical.\nFor example, you\u00a0may be able to help\u00a0manage:\n\nfood allergies\u00a0by being careful about what you eat\nanimal allergies by keeping pets outside as much as possible and washing them regularly\nmould allergies by\u00a0keeping your home dry and well-ventilated, and dealing with any damp and condensation\nhay fever by\u00a0staying indoors and avoiding grassy areas when the pollen count is high\ndust mite allergies by\u00a0using allergy-proof duvets and pillows, and fitting wooden floors rather than carpets\n\nRead more about preventing allergic reactions.\nAllergy medications\nMedications for mild allergies are available from pharmacies on the Pharmacy First Scotland service without a prescription, but always ask your pharmacist for advice before starting any new medicine, as they're not suitable for everyone.\nAntihistamines\u00a0are the main medicines for allergies. They\u00a0can be used:\n\nas and when you notice\u00a0the symptoms of\u00a0an allergic reaction\nto prevent allergic reactions\u00a0\u2013 for example, you may take them in the morning\u00a0if you have hay fever and you know the pollen count is high that day\n\nAntihistamines\u00a0can be taken\u00a0as tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, eye drops or nasal sprays, depending on which part of your body is affected by your allergy.\nDecongestants\u00a0can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose caused by an allergic reaction.\nThey\u00a0can be taken as tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids. Don't use them for more than a week at a time, as using them for long periods can make your symptoms worse.\nRed and itchy skin caused by an allergic reaction can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams and lotions, such as:\n\nemollients (moisturising creams)\u00a0to keep the skin moist and protect it from allergens\ncalamine lotion to reduce itchiness\nsteroids to reduce inflammation (see below)\n\nSteroid medications\u00a0can help reduce inflammation caused by an allergic reaction.\u00a0They're available as:\n\nnasal sprays and eye drops for an inflamed\u00a0nose and eyes\ncreams for\u00a0eczema and\u00a0contact dermatitis\ninhalers for\u00a0asthma\ntablets for\u00a0hives (urticaria)\n\nSprays, drops and weak steroid creams are available without a prescription. Stronger creams,\u00a0inhalers and tablets are available on prescription from your GP.\nImmunotherapy (desensitisation)\u00a0\nImmunotherapy may be an option for a small number of people with certain severe and persistent allergies who are unable to control their symptoms using the measures above.\nThe treatment involves being given occasional small doses of the allergen \u2013 either as an injection, or as drops or tablets under the tongue\u00a0\u2013 over the course of several years.\nThe injection\u00a0can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. The drops or tablets can usually be\u00a0taken at home.\nThe aim of treatment is to help\u00a0your body get used to the allergen so it doesn't react to it so severely.\u00a0This won't necessarily cure\u00a0your allergy, but it will make it milder and mean you can take less medication.\nTreating severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)\nSome people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions,\u00a0known as\u00a0anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock.\nIf you're at risk of this, you'll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency.\nIf you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help.\nRead more about the treating anaphylaxis.\n\n\nThe best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you're allergic to, although this isn't always easy or practical.\nBelow is some practical advice that should help you avoid the most common allergens.\nHouse dust mites\nOne of the biggest causes of allergies are dust mites, which are tiny insects found in household dust. You can limit the number of mites in your home by:\u00a0\n\nchoosing wood or hard vinyl floor coverings instead of a carpet\nfitting roller blinds that can be easily wiped clean\nchoosing\u00a0leather, plastic or vinyl furniture instead of upholstered furniture\ncleaning cushions, soft toys, curtains and upholstered furniture regularly, either by washing (at a high temperature) or vacuuming\nusing tested allergy-proof covers on mattresses, duvets and pillows\nusing a vacuum cleaner fitted with a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter, because it can trap more dust mites than ordinary vacuum cleaners\nregularly wiping surfaces with a damp, clean cloth\u00a0\u2013 avoid dry dusting, as this can spread dust into the air\n\nConcentrate your efforts of controlling dust mites in the areas of your home where you spend the most time, such as the bedroom and living room.\nYou can find more information on allergies in the home\u00a0on the Allergy UK website.\nPets\nIt's not the pet fur that causes an allergic reaction. Instead, it's flakes of their dead skin, saliva and dried urine.\nIf you can't permanently remove a pet from the house, you could try:\u00a0\n\nkeeping pets outside as much as possible, or limiting them to a particular area of the house, preferably\u00a0an area\u00a0without carpet\nnot allowing pets in bedrooms\nwashing pets at least once a\u00a0week\nregularly grooming\u00a0pets outside\nregularly washing all bedding and soft furnishings on which a pet has lain\nusing an air filter in rooms where you spend most of your time\nincrease ventilation with fans, air-conditioning or by opening windows\n\nIf you're visiting a friend or relative with a pet, ask them not to dust or vacuum on the day you're visiting, as this will stir up the allergens into the air. Taking an antihistamine medicine about an hour before entering a pet-inhabited house can also help reduce your symptoms.\nThe Allergy UK website has more information about domestic pet allergies.\nMould spores\nTiny particles released by moulds can cause an allergic reaction in some people.\nYou can help prevent this by:\n\nkeeping your home dry and well-ventilated\nremoving any indoor pot plants from your home\nnot drying clothes indoors, store clothes in damp cupboards or packing clothes too tightly in wardrobes\ndealing with any damp and condensation in your home\navoiding damp buildings, damp woods and rotten leaves, cut grass and compost heaps\n\nBy law, food manufacturers must clearly label any foods that contain something that's known to cause allergic reactions in some people. By carefully checking the label for the list of ingredients, you should be able to avoid an allergic reaction.\nPeople with food allergies\u00a0most often experience an allergic reaction while eating out at a restaurant. You can avoid this by:\n\nnot relying on the menu description alone (remember, many sauces or dressings could contain allergens)\ncommunicating clearly with the waiting staff and asking for their advice\navoiding places where there's a chance that different types of food could come into contact with each other, such as buffets or bakeries\nlet restaurant staff you know your dietary requirements, including how severe your food allergy or intolerance is\nalways check what allergens are in the dish even if you have eaten it before, as recipes and ingredients can change\n\nRemember, simple dishes are less likely to contain \"hidden\" ingredients.

Doctors often call hay fever allergic rhinitis.\u00a0\nDifferent plants pollinate at different times of the year, so the months that you get hay fever will depend on what sort of pollen(s) you are allergic to. Typically, people are affected during spring (trees) and summer (grasses).\nTo\u00a0help\u00a0keep your hay fever under control,\u00a0you can:\n\ncheck weather reports for the pollen count and stay indoors when it's high, if possible\navoid drying clothes\u00a0and bedding outside when the pollen count is high\nwear wraparound sunglasses to protect your eyes\nkeep doors and windows shut when possible\nshower and change your clothes after being outside\navoid grassy areas, such as parks and fields\u00a0\u2013\u00a0particularly in the early morning, evening or night, when the pollen count is highest\nif you have a lawn,\u00a0try asking someone else to cut the grass for you\u00a0\n\nInsect bites and stings\nIf you've ever suffered a bad reaction to an insect bite or sting, it's important to take precautions to minimise your risk.\nWhen you're outdoors, particularly in the summer, you could:\n\ncover exposed skin\nwear shoes\napply insect repellent\navoid wearing strong perfumes or fragrances, as these can attract insects\n\nRead more about preventing insect bites and stings.\nPreventing severe allergies (anaphylaxis)\nIf you're\u00a0at risk of experiencing a\u00a0severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), make sure you carry two adrenaline auto-injectors\u00a0with you\u00a0everywhere.\nWearing a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag medallion or bracelet can make others aware of your allergy in an emergency.\nConsider telling your teachers, work colleagues and friends, so they can give you your adrenaline injection in an emergency, while waiting for an ambulance.\nRead more about preventing anaphylaxis.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting an estimated 850,000 people in the UK.\nDementia is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory.\nThe exact cause\u00a0of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition.

For example, this could be\u00a0forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects.\nAs the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and\u00a0further symptoms can develop, such as:\n\nconfusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places\ndifficulty planning or making decisions\nproblems with speech and language\nproblems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks\npersonality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others\nhallucinations\u00a0(seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue)\nlow mood\u00a0or anxiety\n\nRead more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease\nWho is affected?\nAlzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age\u00a0of\u00a065, and affects slightly more women than men.\nThe risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia\u00a0increases with age,\u00a0affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80.\nHowever, around\u00a01 in every 20 cases of Alzheimer's disease affects people aged 40 to 65.\nReceiving\u00a0a diagnosis\nAs the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older.\nHowever,\u00a0a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you\u00a0the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support\u00a0that may help.\nIf you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.\nThere's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Your GP will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions.\nIf Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to:\n\ndiscuss the process of making the diagnosis\norganise testing\u00a0\ncreate a treatment plan\n\nRead more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease\nHow Alzheimer's disease is treated\nThere's no cure for Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0but medication is available that can help\u00a0relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people.\nVarious other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks.\nPsychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to\u00a0help\u00a0support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability.\nRead more about treating Alzheimer's disease\nOutlook\nOn average, people with Alzheimer's disease live for around\u00a08 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. However, this can vary considerably from person to person. Some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not.\nAlzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause.\nAs\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. It's also common for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite.\u00a0\nThere's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease need\u00a0palliative care. This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's.\nCan Alzheimer's disease be prevented?\nAs the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease isn't clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as:\n\nstopping\u00a0smoking\u00a0and cutting down on alcohol\neating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight\nstaying physically fit and mentally active\n\nThese measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health.\nRead more about preventing Alzheimer's disease\n\n\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly over several years. Sometimes these symptoms are confused with other conditions and may initially be put down to old age.\nThe rate at which the symptoms progress is different for each individual and it's not possible to predict exactly how quickly it will get worse.\nIn some cases,\u00a0infections, medications, strokes or delirium\u00a0can be responsible for symptoms getting worse. Anyone with Alzheimer's disease whose symptoms are rapidly getting worse should be seen by a doctor, so these can be managed.\nStages of Alzheimer's disease\nGenerally, the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are divided into\u00a0three main stages.\nIn the early stages, the main symptom of\u00a0Alzheimer's disease is memory lapses. For example, someone with early Alzheimer's disease may:\n\nforget about recent conversations or events, or misplace items\nforget the names of places and objects, or have trouble thinking of the right word\nrepeat themselves regularly, such as asking the same question several times\nshow poor judgement or find it harder to make decisions\nbecome less flexible and more hesitant to try new things\n\nThere are often signs of\u00a0mood changes, such as increasing anxiety or agitation, or periods of confusion.\nAs Alzheimer's disease develops, memory problems will get worse. Someone with the condition may find it increasingly difficult to remember\u00a0the names of people they know and may struggle to recognise their family and friends.\nOther symptoms may also develop, such as:\n\nincreasing confusion and disorientation\u00a0\u2013 for example, getting lost, or wandering and not knowing what time of day it is\nobsessive, repetitive or impulsive behaviour\ndelusions (believing things that are untrue) or feeling paranoid and suspicious about carers or family members\nproblems with speech\u00a0or\u00a0language (aphasia)\ndisturbed sleep\nchanges in\u00a0mood, such as frequent mood swings, depression and feeling\u00a0increasingly anxious, frustrated or agitated\ndifficulty performing\u00a0spatial tasks, such as\u00a0judging distances\nhallucinations\n\nBy this stage, someone with Alzheimer's disease usually needs support to help them with their everyday living. For example, they may\u00a0need help eating, washing, getting dressed and using the toilet.\nIn the later stages of Alzheimer's disease, the symptoms become increasingly severe and distressing for the person with the condition, as well as their carers, friends and family.\nHallucinations and delusions may come and go over the course of the illness, but can get\u00a0worse as the condition progresses. Sometimes people with Alzheimer's disease can be\u00a0violent, demanding and suspicious of those around them.\nA number of other symptoms may also develop as Alzheimer's disease progresses, such as:\n\ndifficulty eating and swallowing (dysphagia)\ndifficulty changing position or moving around without assistance\nconsiderable weight loss \u2013 although some people eat too much and put on weight\nunintentional passing of\u00a0urine (urinary incontinence) or stools (bowel incontinence)\ngradual loss of speech\nsignificant problems with short- and long-term memory\n\nIn the severe stages of Alzheimer's disease, people may need full-time care and assistance with eating, moving and using the toilet.\nRead more about how Alzheimer's disease is treated\nSeeking medical advice\nIf you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.\nMemory problems are not just caused by dementia \u2013 they\u00a0can also be caused by depression, stress, medications or other health problems. Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for more tests, if necessary.\nRead more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease is caused by parts of the brain shrinking (atrophy), which affects the structure and function of particular brain areas.\nIt's not known exactly what causes this process to begin. However,\u00a0in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, scientists\u00a0have found\u00a0amyloid plaques (abnormal deposits of protein), neurofibrillary tangles (containing tau) and imbalances in a chemical called acetylcholine.\nIt's also common to have a degree of vascular damage in the brain.\nThese\u00a0reduce the effectiveness of\u00a0healthy neurons (nerve cells that carry messages to and from the brain), gradually destroying them.\nOver time, this damage spreads to\u00a0several areas of the brain. The first areas affected are responsible for memories.\nIncreased risk\nAlthough it's still unknown what triggers\u00a0Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0several factors are known to increase your risk of developing the condition.\nAge is the single most significant factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The likelihood of developing the condition doubles every five years after you reach 65 years of age.\nHowever, it's not just older people who are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Around\u00a01 in\u00a020\u00a0people with the condition are under 65.\u00a0This is called early onset Alzheimer's disease and\u00a0it can affect people from around the age of 40.\nThe genes you inherit from\u00a0your parents can contribute to your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, although the actual increase in risk is small if you have a\u00a0close family member with the condition.\nHowever, in a few families, Alzheimer's disease is caused by the inheritance of a single gene, and the risks of the condition\u00a0being passed on are much higher.\nIf several of your family members have developed dementia over the generations, it may be appropriate to seek genetic counselling\u00a0for information and advice about your chances of developing Alzheimer's disease when you are older.\nThe Alzheimer's\u00a0Society website has more information about the genetics of dementia.\nPeople with Down's syndrome are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\nThis is because the genetic fault that causes Down's syndrome can also cause amyloid plaques to build up in the brain over time, which can lead to Alzheimer's disease in some people.\nPeople who have had a severe head injury have been found to be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\nResearch shows that several lifestyle factors and conditions associated with\u00a0cardiovascular disease can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.\nThese include:\n\nsmoking\nobesity\u00a0\ndiabetes\u00a0\nhigh blood pressure\nhigh cholesterol\n\nYou can help reduce your risk by:\n\nstopping smoking\neating a healthy, balanced diet\nleading an active life, both physically and mentally\nlosing weight if you need to\ndrinking less alcohol\nhaving\u00a0regular health checks as you get older\n\nRead more about reducing your risk of Alzheimer's disease\n\n\nIt's best to see your GP if you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia.\nIf you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest going with them. It's often very helpful having a friend or family member there.\nA timely\u00a0diagnosis gives you the best chance to adjust, prepare and plan for the future, as well as accessing treatments and support that may help.\nSeeing your GP\nMemory problems aren't just caused by dementia\u00a0\u2013 they can also be caused by:\n\ndepression or anxiety\nstress\nmedications\nalcohol or drugs\nother health problems \u2013 such as hormonal disturbances or nutritional deficiencies\n\nYour GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be. They\u00a0can then refer you to a specialist for assessment, if necessary.\nYour GP will ask about your concerns and what you or your family have noticed. They'll also check\u00a0other aspects of your health, and carry out a physical examination. They may also organise some\u00a0blood tests and ask about any medication you're taking to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\nYou'll usually be asked some questions\u00a0and carry out\u00a0some\u00a0memory, thinking, and pen and paper tasks to check how different areas of your brain are functioning. This can help your GP decide if you\u00a0need to\u00a0be referred to a specialist for more assessments.\nReferral to a specialist\nYour GP may refer you to a specialist memory assessment service to help with your diagnosis. Memory clinics are staffed by professionals from multiple disciplines who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families.\nMemory clinic staff can include the following, depending on your local area:\n\na nurse \u2013 usually a trained mental health nurse who specialises in diagnosing and caring for people with dementia\na psychologist \u2013 a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions\na psychiatrist \u2013 a qualified medical doctor who has training in treating mental health conditions\na neurologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)\na geriatrician \u2013 a physician with specialist training in the care of older people\na social worker \u2013 a trained member of staff able to advise and assist with accessing social services within the local area\nan occupational therapist \u2013 a member of staff with specialist skills in assessing and supporting people with dementia and their families with adjusting to disabilities\n\nThere's no simple and reliable test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0but\u00a0the staff will listen to the concerns of both you and your family about your memory or thinking. They will assess your skills and arrange more tests to rule out other conditions.\nA specialist will usually assess your mental abilities using a special series of questions.\nOne widely used test is the mini mental state examination (MMSE). This involves being asked to carry out activities such as memorising a short list of objects\u00a0correctly and identifying the current day of the week, month and year. Different memory clinics may also use other, longer tests.\u00a0\nThe MMSE isn't used to diagnose\u00a0Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0but it's useful to initially assess areas of difficulty that a person with\u00a0the condition may have. This helps specialists to make decisions about treatment and whether more tests are necessary.\nTo rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and look for possible signs of damage caused by Alzheimer's disease, your specialist may recommend having a brain scan. This could be a:\n\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 where several X-rays of your brain are taken at slightly different angles and a computer is used to put the images together\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0\u2013 where a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of the inside of your brain\u00a0\n\nSome specialist centres offer scans which look at brain function and particular protein deposits. However, at the moment, these are mostly experimental and only used if the diagnosis is unclear.\u00a0\nAfter\u00a0diagnosis\nIt may take several\u00a0appointments and tests over months, or even years, before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be confirmed.\nFor some people, a diagnosis of\u00a0Alzheimer's disease is a huge shock, especially as it's not unusual for people with dementia to have less awareness of their difficulties.\nFor others, the diagnosis can be very important in helping them and their families to make sense of symptoms they've been concerned about for a long time.\nIf you've just been given a diagnosis of dementia, you may be feeling numb, scared and unable to take everything in. It may be helpful to have the diagnosis explained again to help make sense of the idea over time. It might help to talk\u00a0things through with family and friends.\nIt takes time to adapt to a diagnosis of dementia, for both you and your family. Some people find it helpful to seek information and plan for the future, but others may need a longer period to process the news.\nHowever, as dementia is a progressive illness, the weeks to months after a diagnosis is often a good time to think about legal, financial and healthcare matters for the future.\nRead more about\u00a0what to do if you've just been diagnosed with dementia\n\n\nThere's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, although medication is available that can temporarily reduce some symptoms or slow down the progression of the condition in some people.\nSupport is also available to help someone with the condition cope with everyday life.\nCare plan\nIf you're diagnosed with\u00a0Alzheimer's disease, it's helpful if your health and social care needs are assessed and plans made for\u00a0the future.\nA care plan is a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. It involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance, such as:\n\nwhat support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible\nwhether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in\nwhether you need any financial assistance\n\nHealthcare professionals (such as your GP or psychiatrist) and social care services\u00a0(which is normally your local council working with the NHS), will usually both be involved in helping draw up and carry out care plans.\nMedication\nA\u00a0number of medications\u00a0may be prescribed for Alzheimer's disease to help temporarily improve some symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition.\nDonepezil,\u00a0galantamine\u00a0and rivastigmine (known as AChE inhibitors)\u00a0can be prescribed for people with early to mid-stage Alzheimer's disease. Memantine may be prescribed for people with mid-stage disease who cannot take AChE inhibitors, or\u00a0for those with\u00a0late-stage disease.\nThere's no difference in how well each of the three different AChE inhibitors work, although\u00a0some people\u00a0respond better\u00a0to\u00a0certain types or have fewer side effects.\nAll of these medications can only be prescribed by specialists such as psychiatrists, neurologists and geriatricians. They may be prescribed by your GP on the advice of a specialist.\nIf you're caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease, your views should be taken into account when prescribing medication, as well as at regular assessments. These assessments take place to ensure the medication is having a worthwhile effect and to identify and monitor side effects.\nRead guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\nDonepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine\u00a0can cause side effects\u00a0such as:\n\nfeeling and being sick\ndizziness\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nheadache\u00a0\nagitation\ninsomnia\nmuscle cramps\nmore rarely, slowing of the heartbeat\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which can cause issues if you already have problems with your heart rhythm.\n\nThese side effects are more likely to occur at the beginning of therapy or when the dose is increased. Your doctor should review your medical history and your other medications to check the suitability and risk of interactions.\nCommon side effects of memantine include:\n\ndizziness\nheadaches\nhigh blood pressure\ntiredness\nconstipation\nshortness of breath\nmore rarely, problems with walking or increased confusion\nvery rarely, seizures\n\nFor more information about the possible side effects of your specific medication, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with it or speak to your doctor.\nSupportive measures and treatments\nIn addition to medication, treatment for Alzheimer's disease involves a wide range of other measures and treatments to help\u00a0people with dementia\u00a0live as independently as possible.\nFor example, an\u00a0occupational therapist can identify problems or unsafe areas\u00a0in your everyday life and help you to develop strategies or use alternative tools to manage these. They may suggest:\n\nways of prompting and reminding yourself of important tasks\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as using diaries or calendars\nassistive technology\u00a0\u2013\u00a0devices or systems to help maintain the independence and\u00a0safety of people living with dementia\nadding grab bars and handrails to your home to help you move around safely\nother professionals visiting you at home and assisting with daily tasks to maintain your independence in the community\n\nPsychological treatments, such as cognitive stimulation,\u00a0may be offered to\u00a0help improve your memory, problem solving skills and language ability.\nMedication, other psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), music and art therapy, reminiscence and relaxation therapies may also be offered. These may help with managing depression, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and challenging behaviour that can occur with Alzheimer's disease.\nRead more about how dementia is treated\nPractical tips for people with Alzheimer's\nIf you have Alzheimer's disease, you may find it useful to:\n\nkeep a diary and write down things you want to remember\npin a weekly timetable to the wall\nput your keys in an obvious place, such as in a large bowl in your living room\nhave a daily newspaper delivered to remind you of the day and date\nput labels on cupboards and drawers\nkeep useful telephone numbers by the phone\nwrite yourself reminders\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, put a note on the front door to remind you to take your keys with you if you go out\nprogramme people's names and numbers into your telephone\nset the alarm on your watch to act as a reminder\ninstall safety devices such as gas detectors and smoke alarms throughout your home\n\nIt may also be helpful to\u00a0get in touch with a local or national Alzheimer's or dementia support group, such as the Alzheimer's Society, for more information and advice about living with Alzheimer's disease.\nRead more about living well with dementia\nAdvance care planning\nPeople with dementia often live for many years after their diagnosis. However, as it's a progressive condition, it can be helpful and reassuring for both you and your family if you make plans for the future.\nAdvance care planning means considering, discussing and possibly recording your wishes and decisions for future care. It's about planning for a time when you may not be able to make some decisions for yourself.\nIn the earlier stages of the disease, you should have the opportunity to discuss with health professionals and your family about the future. This may involve the use of:\n\nadvance statements\u00a0\nadvance decisions to refuse treatment\nlasting power of attorney\npreferred priorities\u00a0for care\n\nPalliative care\nAlthough the outlook is variable, dementia is a life-limiting illness and can begin to affect multiple body systems in the later stages.\nEnd of life care, or palliative care, provides support for people with an incurable illness, so they're able to live as well and as comfortably as possible until their death. It also involves support for family members. Care\u00a0may be provided at home, a hospice, a care home or hospital.\nFor people nearing the end of life, their care team should assess their needs, make them feel comfortable and allow them to die with dignity in a place of their choosing.\nRead more about palliative care\nTelecare Self-Check online tool\nVisit the Telecare Self-Check online tool to find the right support for you in your area.\u00a0This easy to use online tool allows you to find helpful information on telecare services that could help you live independently at home for longer.\n\n\n\nAs the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is still unknown, there's no way to prevent the condition. However, there are steps you can take that may help to delay the onset of dementia.\nReducing your risk of cardiovascular disease\nCardiovascular disease\u00a0has been linked with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.\nYou may be able to reduce\u00a0your risk of developing these conditions\u00a0\u2013 as well as other serious problems, such as\u00a0strokes and heart attacks\u00a0\u2013 by taking steps to improve your cardiovascular health, including:\u00a0\n\nstopping smoking\nnot drinking large amounts of alcohol\neating a healthy, balanced diet, including at least five portions of fruit and vegetables every day\nexercising for at least 150 minutes\u00a0(2 hours and 30 minutes) every week by\u00a0doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking)\u00a0\u2013 this will improve both your physical and mental health\nmake sure your blood pressure is checked and controlled through regular health tests\nif you have diabetes, make sure you keep to the diet and take\u00a0your medication\n\nRead more about preventing dementia\nStaying mentally active\nThere's some evidence to suggest that rates of dementia are lower in people who remain as mentally, physically and socially active as possible throughout their lives, as well as among those who enjoy a wide range of different activities and hobbies.\nIt may be possible to reduce your risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia by:\n\nreading\nwriting for pleasure\nlearning foreign languages\nplaying musical instruments\ntaking part in adult education courses\nplaying tennis\nplaying golf\nswimming\ngroup sports, such as bowling\nwalking\n\nInterventions such as \"brain training\" computer games have been shown to improve cognition over a short period, but research hasn't yet demonstrated whether this can prevent dementia.\nFuture research\nResearch into Alzheimer's disease is continuing.\u00a0As more is revealed about the condition, other ways to treat or prevent it may be found.\nParticipation in research is important and helps to improve dementia care and support for people with dementia, plus their carers and families.\nYou can read about ongoing dementia research\u00a0on the Alzheimer's Research UK\u00a0website. You can also ask your local memory clinic about projects taking place.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has advised that there isn't evidence to support the use of the following to prevent dementia:\n\nstatins\nhormone replacement therapy \u2013 when chemicals are taken to replace those that your body no longer produces\nvitamin E \u2013 found in a variety of foods, such as olive oil, nuts and seeds\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly.\nIt is also known as anaphylactic shock.\nSigns of anaphylaxis include:\n\nitchy skin or a raised, red skin rash\nswollen eyes, lips, hands and feet\nfeeling lightheaded or faint\nswelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties\nwheezing\nabdominal pain, nausea and vomiting\ncollapse and unconsciousness\n\nWhat to do\nAnaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency.

Substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens.\nAnaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to 4\u00a0hours later.\nThe most widely reported triggers of anaphylaxis are:\n\ninsect stings\u00a0\u2013 particularly wasp and bee stings\npeanuts and tree nuts\nother types of foods\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as milk and seafood\ncertain medicines\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0antibiotics\n\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of anaphylaxis.\nPreventing further episodes\nIf you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it's important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers.\nYou should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to either find out your allergy triggers or, if you already know what causes it, for further assessment and advice about how to avoid allergens in the future.\nYou may be given two adrenaline auto-injectors to use during any future episodes of anaphylaxis.\nRead more about\u00a0preventing anaphylaxis.\nWho is affected?\nAnaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. People with other allergic conditions, such as\u00a0asthma or the allergic skin condition\u00a0atopic eczema, are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis.\nAlthough the condition is life threatening, deaths are rare. There are around 20 deaths in the UK each year. With prompt and proper treatment, most people make a full recovery.\u00a0\n\n\nAnaphylaxis is caused by a problem with the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection.\nIn the case of anaphylaxis, your immune system overreacts to a harmless substance and releases a number of different chemicals, such as histamine, to deal with the mistaken threat.\nTriggers\nSome of the more common triggers for anaphylaxis are shown below.\nMost cases of anaphylaxis are caused by wasp and bee stings, although potentially any insect bite or sting can cause anaphylaxis.\nIt's estimated around\u00a01 in 100 people will experience an allergic reaction after a wasp or bee sting, but only a small number of these people will go on to develop severe anaphylaxis.\nMore than half of all cases of food-related anaphylaxis are caused by peanuts.\nOther foods known to trigger anaphylaxis include:\n\nnuts\u00a0\u2013 such as walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds, brazil nuts and hazelnuts\nmilk\nfish and shellfish\neggs\nsome types of fruit\u00a0\u2013 such as bananas, kiwi fruit, grapes and strawberries\n\nMedicines known to trigger anaphylaxis in a small amount of people include:\n\nantibiotics\u00a0\u2013 particularly penicillin-like antibiotics\ngeneral anaesthetic\u00a0\u2013\u00a0muscle-relaxant medicines used during surgery\u00a0\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0\u2013 a type of painkiller that includes\u00a0ibuprofen and\u00a0aspirin\n\nPeople sensitive to these types of medicines will usually develop anaphylaxis as soon as they begin a course of treatment, although they may have safely received them in the past.\nThe risk of anaphylaxis using these types of medicines is very small, so in most cases the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk.\nFor example, the risk of developing anaphylaxis is around:\n\n1 in 1,480\u00a0after taking a NSAID-type painkiller\u00a0\n1 in 5,000 after taking penicillin\n1 in 10,000 after being given a general anaesthetic\n\nContrast agents are a group of special dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of your body show up better on scans such as\u00a0X-rays.\nFor example, a contrast agent injected into a blood vessel will help show up any problems in the vessel, such as a blockage, on the X-ray. This is known as\u00a0angiography.\nThe risk of developing anaphylaxis after being injected with a contrast agent is thought to be less than\u00a01 in 10,000.\nLess than 1 in 100 people in the population has a\u00a0natural rubber latex allergy. Healthcare, hair, beauty, catering and motor industry workers are more likely to have a latex allergy.\nThose with a history of hayfever, asthma, eczema, and certain medical conditions, like spina bifida, are more likely to be affected.\nSometimes, despite extensive testing, no trigger can be found for anaphylaxis, and the cause remains unknown. This is known as idiopathic anaphylaxis.\n\n\nIf you think somebody is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, you should use an adrenaline injector if one is available. Dial 999 immediately afterwards.\nCall 999 straight away if an adrenaline injector is not available.\nIf you can see a potential trigger, such as a wasp or bee sting stuck in their skin, carefully remove it.\nAdrenaline injections\nAdrenaline causes the blood vessels to become narrower, which raises your blood pressure and reduces swelling. It also causes the airways to open, relieving breathing difficulties.\nAn adrenaline injection should be given as soon as a serious reaction is suspected.\nThe signs of suspected anaphylaxis are:\n\nproblems breathing\nfeeling faint or dizzy\nloss of consciousness\n\nThe injection\u00a0can be done by the person with anaphylaxis, but sometimes\u00a0\u2013 if it's a young child or someone who is unconscious, for example\u00a0\u2013 another person may need to do it.\nBefore attempting the injection, make sure you know what to do. You should read all of the instructions carefully when you, or the person you are responsible for, are first prescribed the injector.\nAfter injecting, the syringe should be held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Injections can be given through clothing.\nAfter injecting the adrenaline, you should immediately dial 999 for an ambulance, even if the person is starting to feel better.\nMost people should experience a rapid improvement in symptoms once the adrenaline has been used.\nIf there's no improvement after 5 to 10 minutes, you should inject a second dose of adrenaline, if one is available. This should be injected into the opposite thigh.\nRead Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 2014\u00a0guidelines on how to use an adrenaline auto-injector (PDF, 188kb).\nIn most cases, the person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table, to help maintain bloodflow to the head and heart.\nPregnant women should lie down on their left side to avoid putting too much pressure on the large vein that leads to the heart.\nIf the person is conscious but having trouble breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier.\nIf the person is unconscious, check that\u00a0their airways are open and clear, and also check their breathing. Then put them in the\u00a0recovery position to make sure they don't choke on their vomit.\nPlace the person on their side, making sure they are supported by one leg and one arm. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin.\nIf the person's breathing or heart stops,\u00a0cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed.\nEven if adrenaline is given, the person will need to go to hospital for observation\u00a0\u2013 usually for\u00a06 to 12 hours \u2013 as symptoms can occasionally return during this period.\nWhile in hospital, an oxygen mask can be used to help breathing, and fluids given by an intravenous drip directly into a vein can help increase blood pressure.\nAs well as adrenaline, additional medications such as\u00a0antihistamines and corticosteroids\u00a0can be used to help relieve symptoms. Blood tests\u00a0may also be carried out while you're in hospital to confirm anaphylaxis.\nYou should be able to leave hospital when the symptoms are under control and it's thought they will not return quickly. This may be after a few hours, but you may have to stay in hospital for a few days if the symptoms were severe.\nYou may be asked to take antihistamines and corticosteroid tablets 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days after leaving hospital to help stop your symptoms returning.\nYou will probably be asked to attend a follow-up appointment so you can be given advice about how you can avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.\nAn adrenaline auto-injector may be given to you for emergency use between leaving hospital and attending the follow-up appointment.\nRead more about preventing anaphylaxis.\n\n\nIf you have anaphylaxis, you should be offered advice and medication to help prevent further episodes.\nAllergy clinic\nYou should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic for tests to find out what caused the anaphylaxis. Knowing what allergen triggered the allergic reaction can help you avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis.\nSome of the tests commonly used to determine allergies include:\n\na skin prick test \u2013 your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of a suspected allergen to see if it reacts by becoming red, raised and itchy\na blood test \u2013 a sample of your blood is taken to test its reaction to a suspected allergen\n\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing allergies.\nAdrenaline auto-injectors\nYou may be prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector if you've had a previous episode of anaphylaxis and there's a risk of you having another episode in the future.\nThere are 3\u00a0types of auto-injector:\n\nEpiPen\nJext\u00a0\nEmerade\n\nEach type is slightly different, and you should make sure you know how to use your auto-injector correctly.\nYou can also ask for a \"trainer\" kit so you can practise giving yourself or your child injections.\nThe following points are important:\n\nCarry your auto-injector(s) at all times \u2013 there should be no exceptions. It may also be recommended that you get an emergency card or bracelet with full details of your allergy and doctor's contact details to alert others.\nExtremes of heat can make adrenaline less effective, so don't leave your auto-injector in\u00a0the fridge or your car's glove compartment.\nCheck the expiry date regularly. An out-of-date injector will offer limited protection.\nThe manufacturers offer a reminder service, where you can be contacted near the expiry date. Check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine for more information.\nIf your child has an auto-injector, they will need to change over to an adult dose once they reach 30kg (approximately\u00a04.5 stone).\nDon't delay injecting yourself if you think you may be experiencing the beginning of anaphylaxis, even if your initial symptoms are mild. It's better to use adrenaline early and then find out it was a false alarm than delay treatment until you're sure you are experiencing severe anaphylaxis.\n\nAvoid triggers\nIf a trigger has been identified as causing your episode of anaphylaxis, you will need to take steps to avoid it in the future.\nYou can reduce the chances of being exposed to a food allergen by:\n\nchecking food labels\nletting staff at a restaurant know what you're allergic to, so it's not included in your meal\nremembering that some types of food may contain small traces of potential allergens \u2013 for example, some sauces contain wheat and peanuts\n\nSee\u00a0our page on living with a food allergy\u00a0for more information.\nYou can reduce your risk of being stung by an insect by taking basic precautions, such as:\n\nmoving away from wasps, hornets or bees slowly without panicking \u2013 don't wave your arms around or swat at them\nusing an insect repellent if you spend time outdoors, particularly in the summer\n\nSome specialist allergy centres also offer special treatment to help desensitise you to insect stings if you are at a particularly high risk of a further sting\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you are\u00a0a beekeeper or gardener.\nRead more about\u00a0preventing insect stings.\nIf you're allergic to certain types of medicines, there are normally alternatives that can be safely used. For example, if you're allergic to:\n\npenicillin \u2013 you can normally safely take a different group of antibiotics known as\u00a0macrolides\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as\u00a0ibuprofen and aspirin \u2013 you can normally safely take\u00a0paracetamol, but read the ingredients of things like colds medicines carefully to make sure they don't contain NSAIDs\none type of\u00a0general anaesthetic \u2013 others are available, or it may be possible to perform surgery using a\u00a0local anaesthetic or an\u00a0epidural injection\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \u2013 alternative blood pressure medications, such as calcium channel blockers, can be used\n\nAlways tell any healthcare professional about medicine allergies you have, as they may not be aware of them.\nThere may be times when it's necessary to use contrast agents \u2013 for example, if you had bleeding inside your brain \u2013 even if this places you at risk of anaphylaxis.\nIn such circumstances, you can be given injections of\u00a0antihistamines and\u00a0corticosteroids before the contrast agents, which may help prevent symptoms occurring or at least make them less severe.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Angioedema is the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, caused by a build-up of fluid.\nThe symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but\u00a0swelling usually\u00a0affects the:\n\neyes\nlips\ngenitals\nhands\nfeet\n\nMany people with angioedema also experience urticaria (hives). This is a raised, red and itchy rash that appears on the skin.\nWhy does angioedema happen?\nThe cause of angioedema depends on the type you have. There are 4\u00a0main types of angioedema:\n\nallergic angioedema \u2013\u00a0the swelling is caused by an allergic reaction, such as a reaction to peanuts, and sometimes occurs in combination with anaphylaxis\nidiopathic angioedema \u2013\u00a0there is no known cause for the swelling (although certain factors, such as stress or infection, may trigger the symptoms)\ndrug-induced angioedema \u2013\u00a0the swelling is a side effect of certain medications,\u00a0most often\u00a0angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nhereditary angioedema \u2013\u00a0the swelling is caused by \"faulty\" genes that are inherited from a person\u2019s parents\n\nRead more about the causes of angioedema.\nWho is affected\nAngioedema is a common condition, affecting about 10-20% of people during their life, although\u00a0some types are more common than others.\nHereditary angioedema is rare, only affecting between 1 in 10,000\u00a0and 1 in 50,000 people worldwide.\nDiagnosis\nYour doctor can\u00a0diagnose angioedema by examining the affected skin and\u00a0discussing symptoms.\nHowever, further tests, such as blood tests\u00a0or allergy tests,\u00a0may be required to determine the type of angioedema.\nIdiopathic angioedema is only diagnosed if no cause can be found.\nRead more about diagnosing angioedema.\nHow is angioedema treated?\nAlthough most cases of angioedema get better without treatment after a few days, medication is often used.\nFor cases of allergic and idiopathic angioedema, antihistamines and\u00a0oral steroids (steroid tablets) can be used to relieve the swelling.\nDrug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by\u00a0using an alternative medication to treat whatever underlying condition you have.\nAlthough the condition cannot be cured, regular drug treatment can prevent attacks in people with hereditary angioedema.\nRead more about treating angioedema.\n\n\nThe main sign of angioedema is swelling that develops below the skin's surface.\nSwollen skin\nThe swelling is caused by a collection of fluid in the deep layers of the skin.\nIt most often affects the hands, feet, eyes, lips, or genitals. In severe cases, the inside lining of the throat and bowel can be affected (see below).\nThe swelling\u00a0usually appears suddenly, and is more severe than normal hives (nettle rash). It commonly lasts 1\u00a0to 3\u00a0days. There may be a prickling sensation in the affected area before swelling is visible.\nThe swelling is not itchy and the skin may look a normal colour; however, many people with allergic or idiopathic angioedema also develop\u00a0urticaria (hives), which is red and itchy.\nOther symptoms\nAs well as visible swellings, angioedema can cause other symptoms, including:\n\na hot or painful\u00a0sensation in the swollen areas\nswelling of the inside of the throat, the\u00a0windpipe and the tongue, making breathing difficult\nswelling of the conjunctiva (the transparent layer of cells that cover the white part of the eye), which affects\u00a0vision\n\nPeople with hereditary angioedema may also experience:\n\nabdominal (stomach) pain caused by swelling in the stomach and bowel, which can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea\nswelling of the bladder or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the genitals), which can cause bladder problems and difficulty passing urine\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nContact your GP if you have an episode of angioedema that does not affect your breathing and you have not previously been diagnosed with the condition. You will need to have tests to determine what type of angioedema you have.\nWhen to seek emergency medical advice\nDial 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you, or someone you know, is experiencing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction). Tell the operator that you suspect anaphylaxis.\nInitial symptoms of anaphylaxis include:\n\na feeling of tightness in the chest that leads to\u00a0breathing problems\u00a0\nswelling of the tongue and throat\n\nIf you, or the person in your care, has previously been prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector pen, you should use it while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.\n\n\nAngioedema is often caused by a problem with the immune system, although there are many cases where no cause can be identified.\nAllergic angioedema\nNormally, your immune system protects your body from illness and infection by attacking germs in your body.\nIn allergic angioedema, your immune system mistakenly attacks harmless substances in your blood. Your body produces the chemical histamine, which causes the blood vessels in the area to expand, leading to swelling of the skin.\nSubstances known to trigger allergic angioedema include:\n\ncertain types of food \u2013 particularly nuts, shellfish, milk and eggs\nsome types of medication\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as penicillin, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen\ninsect bites and stings \u2013 particularly wasp and bee stings\nlatex \u2013 a naturally occurring rubber used to make medical gloves, balloons and condoms\n\nIdiopathic angioedema\nCases of angioedema without an identifiable cause are known as idiopathic angioedema. It may be that a problem with the immune system sometimes causes it to \"misfire\".\nIn cases of\u00a0idiopathic angioedema, certain triggers may lead to swelling, such as:\n\nanxiety or stress\nminor infections\nhot or cold temperatures\nexercise\n\nAvoiding these triggers whenever possible may improve your symptoms.\nDrug-induced angioedema\nSome medications can cause angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), are usually responsible.\nIt's estimated that around\u00a01-5% of\u00a0people taking ACE inhibitors will develop drug-induced angioedema. Black people being treated with ACE inhibitors are 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0times more likely to develop this side effect than white people.\nAround 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0cases of drug-induced angioedema occurs during the first month of taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining cases develop many months or even years after treatment begins.\nWhile they are useful in lowering blood pressure, ACE inhibitors can sometimes disrupt the \"chemical balance\" and trigger an episode of severe swelling.\nLess common causes of drug-induced angioedema include:\n\nbupropion \u2013\u00a0a medication that helps people to give up smoking\nvaccines\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\u00a0\u2013 a type of antidepressant\nCOX-II inhibitors \u2013 a type of painkiller used to treat chronic pain conditions such as arthritis\nNSAIDs \u2013 a type of painkiller, such as aspirin or ibuprofen\nangiotensin-2 receptor antagonists \u2013\u00a0another medication used to treat high blood pressure\nstatins \u2013\u00a0used to treat people with high cholesterol levels\nproton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \u2013\u00a0used to treat\u00a0stomach ulcers\n\nHereditary angioedema\nHereditary angioedema is caused by a genetic mutation (a change in the DNA) in the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) gene. Genes are single units of genetic material that code for characteristics such as eye and hair colour.\nAs a result of the mutated C1-inh\u00a0gene, the body does not make enough C1-inh\u00a0protein. This protein plays an important role in regulating the immune system. Without enough C1-inh\u00a0protein, the immune system can misfire and trigger the symptoms of angioedema.\nCertain\u00a0things are thought to trigger hereditary angioedema, such as:\n\ntrauma\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including surgery or infection\nthe oral contraceptive pill\npregnancy\n\nThe mutated C1-inh gene is passed down through families. If you have hereditary angioedema, you have a\u00a050% chance of passing it on to your children.\n\n\nAngioedema is usually diagnosed by your doctor examining the affected skin and discussing your symptoms.\nIt can be difficult to find the exact cause and identify which type of angioedema you have. There is no single test available, but you may have allergy tests or\u00a0blood tests if a specific cause is suspected.\nAllergic angioedema\nYou're likely to be asked if\u00a0you have recently been exposed to any allergy-causing substances, such as nuts or latex.\u00a0You may also be asked whether you have a history of other allergic conditions, such as\u00a0urticaria (hives) or asthma. People with an allergic condition often develop other allergic conditions.\nTell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medication, such as painkillers, herbal supplements and vitamins.\nYour GP may recommend that you keep a diary of your exposure to possible irritants \u2013 or a food diary, if a food allergy is suspected.\nIf allergic angioedema is suspected, you are\u00a0likely to be referred to a specialist allergy or immunology clinic for further testing. Tests may include:\n\na skin prick test \u2013\u00a0your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of the suspected allergen to see whether there is a reaction\na\u00a0blood test \u2013 a sample of your blood is tested to determine whether your immune system reacts to a suspected allergen\n\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing allergies.\nDrug-induced angioedema\nIf you are taking a medication known to cause drug-induced angioedema, your GP will withdraw that medication and prescribe an alternative. You should not stop taking any prescribed medication without advice from a health professional.\nIf you don't have any further episodes of angioedema, a diagnosis of drug-induced angioedema can be made.\nHereditary angioedema\nHereditary angioedema can be diagnosed using a blood test to check the level of proteins regulated by the C1-inh gene. A very low level would suggest hereditary angioedema.\nThe diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema is highly specialised and should be carried out in a specialist immunology clinic.\nIdiopathic angioedema\nIdiopathic angioedema is usually confirmed by a \"diagnosis of exclusion\". This means a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema can only be made after all the above tests have been carried out and a cause has not been found.\u00a0\nAs angioedema can be associated with other medical problems \u2013 such as an iron deficiency, liver diseases and problems with the thyroid gland \u2013 your doctor or specialist will undertake some simple blood tests to check for these conditions.\n\n\nMedication is the main treatment for angioedema, although many cases get better after a few days without treatment.\nAllergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema are usually treated in the same way, using a combination of antihistamines and\u00a0corticosteroids to help relieve the swelling.\nDrug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to the one causing your symptoms.\nIf you also had symptoms of anaphylaxis during an episode of angioedema, you will probably be given an adrenaline auto-injector pen in case your symptoms return.\u00a0\nRead more about\u00a0treating anaphylaxis.\nHereditary angioedema cannot be cured and does not respond to adrenaline, antihistamines or steroids, so a preventative approach is taken.\u00a0A number of different medications are used to stabilise the protein levels in your blood to help prevent symptoms developing.\nAntihistamines\nAntihistamines work by blocking the effects of a protein called histamine, which is one of the chemicals responsible for causing your skin to swell.\nA 2-week course of\u00a0a non-sedating type of antihistamine (which does not cause drowsiness) is usually recommended \u2013 these include fexofenadine and cetirizine. Cetirizine can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription.\nAntihistamines can also be given by injection at hospital or your GP surgery.\nIf you also have\u00a0urticaria (hives)\u00a0and are being kept awake at night by itchy skin, your GP may prescribe an older type of antihistamine\u00a0to take before going to bed. These types\u00a0cause drowsiness and should help you sleep.\nA minority of people will still experience drowsiness after taking the newer type of antihistamines. If you find yourself feeling drowsy, you should avoid:\n\ndriving\ndrinking alcohol\noperating complex or heavy machinery\n\nOther side effects of the newer antihistamines include:\n\nheadache\ndry mouth\ndry nose\n\nThese side effects are usually short-lived and should pass quickly.\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids (steroids) work by blocking many of your immune system's actions. In most cases, a 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0day course of steroid tablets is recommended. A steroid called prednisolone is the preferred choice.\nSide effects of prednisolone include:\n\nnausea\nabdominal (stomach) pain\ntiredness\noral thrush\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a fungal infection inside your mouth\ndizziness\n\nIf you feel dizzy after taking prednisolone, avoid driving and operating heavy machinery. These side effects should pass once you finish the course of treatment.\nSteroid injections may be needed for more severe cases of angioedema. These are usually administered in hospitals or at specialist clinics\u00a0by an allergy specialist or immunologist (a doctor who specialises in treating conditions that affect the immune system).\nMedication for hereditary angioedema\nThe medication used to treat hereditary angioedema falls into 1\u00a0of 2\u00a0categories:\n\nmedication used to prevent angioedema\nmedication used to relieve symptoms\n\nDanazol is a synthetic hormone that is effective in preventing the symptoms of angioedema because it helps boost levels of the C1-inh protein.\nHowever, danazol can cause a number of unpleasant side effects if used on a long-term basis. For example, it may cause:\n\nweight gain\ndepression \ndisruption to the menstrual cycle\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0irregular periods or\u00a0absent periods\nhigh blood pressure\nin women, changes to the body that are usually associated with men\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as excessive\u00a0body hair growth, flattening of the chest, deepening of the voice and an increase in muscle tone\nliver problems\n\nDue to\u00a0these side effects, many people with hereditary angioedema are uneasy about using danazol on a long-term basis. Stanozolol is a similar medication that is slightly better tolerated.\nTranexamic acid is also an alternative medication to danazol. It can be as effective as danazol, but does not cause as many side effects and is preferred for use in women.\nIcatibant is a relatively new medication used to treat acute (short-lasting) episodes of swelling. It works by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals that are responsible for causing the swelling in cases of hereditary angioedema.\nIcatibant is given by injection under the skin, and a\u00a0second injection is often required.\nCommon side effects of icatibant include:\n\nadverse skin reactions at the site of the injection\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as pain, redness, swelling or itchiness\nitchiness in other areas of the skin\u00a0\u00a0\ndizziness\n\nPurified C1-inhibitor concentrate is widely used to replace the missing protein in the blood. It's needed for patients undergoing surgery, to prevent attacks caused by surgical trauma. It's used to treat acute attacks and is injected directly into the vein.\nMany patients will keep supplies of their concentrate at home for emergency use.\nIcatibant and C1-inhibitor concentrate will be prescribed by the specialist immunology unit caring for the patient with hereditary angioedema.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a long-term (chronic) condition in which the spine and other areas of the body become inflamed.\nThe\u00a0symptoms of AS can vary but usually involve:\n\nback pain and stiffness that improves with exercise and isn't relieved by rest\npain and swelling in other parts of the body, such as the hips, knees and ribs\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\n\nThese symptoms tend to develop gradually, usually over several months or years, and may come and go over time.\nIn some people, the condition gets better with time, but for others it can get slowly worse.\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis\u00a0\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS.\nIf your GP thinks you may have the condition, they\u00a0should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis.\nWhat causes ankylosing spondylitis?\nIn AS, various areas of the spine and other joints become inflamed.\nAs well as causing\u00a0pain, stiffness and swelling, this inflammation can damage affected areas of the body over time, and in some cases can lead to\u00a0some of the individual bones of the spine fusing (joining together). This fusing of the spine is known as ankylosis.\nIt is not known what causes the condition, but there is thought to be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27.\nRead more about the causes of ankylosing spondylitis.\nWho is affected\nAS tends to first develop in teenagers and young adults. Most cases first start in people aged 20-30, with only a minority of cases first affecting adults over 45.\nAS is around three times more common in men than in women.\nThere are around 200,000 people in the UK who have been diagnosed with the condition.\nHow ankylosing spondylitis is treated\nThere is no cure for AS and it is not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. However, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help prevent or delay its progression.\nIn most cases, treatment will involve a combination of:\n\nexercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness\nphysiotherapy \u2013 where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility\nmedication to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation \u2013 such as\u00a0painkillers and\u00a0a type of medicine called\u00a0anti-TNF medication\n\nSurgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon.\nRead more about treating\u00a0ankylosing spondylitis.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for AS is highly variable. For some people, the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others the condition can get progressively worse over time.\nAround 70-90% of people with AS\u00a0remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term. However,\u00a0some people eventually become severely disabled due to the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees.\nWith modern treatments, AS doesn't normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening\u00a0problems.\nFor example, AS can lead to osteoporosis (weakening of the bones), spinal fractures and cardiovascular disease (a group of conditions affecting the heart\u00a0and blood vessels).\nRead\u00a0more about the\u00a0complications of ankylosing spondylitis.\nInformation about you\nIf you have AS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register.\n\n\nThe symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can vary from person to person, but usually develop slowly, over several months or years.\nAS\u00a0usually first starts to develop\u00a0during\u00a0later teenage years or early adulthood. The symptoms may\u00a0come and go, and improve or get worse over many years.\nMain symptoms\nThe main symptoms of\u00a0AS are described below, although you may not develop all of these if you have the condition.\u00a0\nBack pain\u00a0and stiffness are usually the main symptoms of AS.\u00a0You may find:\n\nthe\u00a0pain gets better with exercise but doesn't improve, or gets worse, with rest\nthe pain and stiffness is worse in the morning and at night \u2013 you may wake up regularly during the night because of the pain\nyou have pain in\u00a0the area around your\u00a0buttocks\n\nAs well as causing symptoms in your back and spine, AS can\u00a0also cause inflammation of the joints (arthritis) in other parts of your body, such as your hips and knees. The main symptoms associated with arthritis are:\n\npain on moving the affected joint\ntenderness when the affected joint is examined\nswelling and warmth in the affected area\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEnthesitis is painful inflammation where a bone is joined to a tendon (a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) or a ligament (a band of tissue that connects bones to bones).\nCommon sites for enthesitis are:\n\nat the top of the shin bone\nbehind the heel (Achilles tendon)\nunder the heel\nwhere\u00a0the ribs join to the breast bone\n\nIf your ribs are affected, you may experience chest pain, and you may find it difficult to expand your chest when breathing deeply.\nFatigue is a common symptom of untreated AS. It can make you feel tired and lacking in energy.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS.\nIf your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n\nIn ankylosing spondylitis (AS), several parts of the lower spine become inflamed, including the vertebrae (bones in the spine) and spinal joints.\nOver time, this can damage the spine and lead to the growth of new bone, which in some cases can cause parts of the spine to join up (fuse) and lose flexibility. This is known as ankylosis.\nIt is not known exactly what causes AS, but in many cases there seems to\u00a0be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27.\nHLA-B27 gene\nResearch has shown that more than 9 out of 10 people\u00a0with AS carry a particular gene known as human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27).\nHaving this gene does not necessarily mean\u00a0you will develop AS. It is estimated that 8 in every 100 people in the general population have the HLA-B27 gene, but most do not have AS.\nIt is thought that having this gene may make you more vulnerable to developing AS, and the condition is triggered by one or more environmental factors \u2013 although it is not known what these are.\nTesting for this gene may be carried out if AS is suspected. However, this test\u00a0is not a very reliable method of diagnosing the condition because some people can have the HLA-B27 gene but not have ankylosing spondylitis.\nRead about how ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed.\nCan ankylosing spondylitis be inherited?\nAS\u00a0can run in families, and the HLA-B27 gene can be inherited from another family member.\nIf you\u00a0have\u00a0AS and tests have shown you carry the HLA-B27 gene, the chance of\u00a0any children you have developing the condition is less than 20%. If you have AS but don't carry the HLA-B27 gene,\u00a0the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 10%.\nIf you have a close relative who has AS, such as a parent or a sibling (brother or sister), you are three times more likely to develop the condition compared with someone who does not have a relative with the condition.\n\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) can be difficult to diagnose because the condition develops slowly and there is no definitive test to confirm a diagnosis.\nThe first thing you should do if you think you have AS is to see your GP. They will ask about your symptoms, including what symptoms you are experiencing, when they started and how long you have had them.\nBack pain associated with\u00a0AS can be\u00a0quite distinctive. For example, it usually doesn't improve with rest and may wake you up during the night.\nBlood tests\nIf your GP suspects AS, they may arrange blood tests\u00a0to check for signs of inflammation in your body.\u00a0Inflammation in your spine and joints is one of the main symptoms of the condition.\nIf your\u00a0results\u00a0suggest you do have inflammation, you\u00a0will be referred to a rheumatologist for further tests. A rheumatologist is a specialist in conditions that affect muscles and joints.\nFurther tests\nYour rheumatologist will carry out imaging tests to examine the appearance of your spine and pelvis, as well as further blood tests. These are described below.\nAn\u00a0X-ray\u00a0of your lower back can show\u00a0damage to the joints at the base of your spine (the sacroiliac joints) and\u00a0new bone forming between the vertebrae (bones in your spine), which are common signs of advanced AS.\nA\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may highlight changes in your sacroiliac joints that might not show up on an X-ray. It may also show any inflammation of ligaments in the spinal region.\nAn\u00a0ultrasound scan\u00a0can pick up inflammation of the tissues (tendons and ligaments) attached to your bones.\nA genetic blood test\u00a0may sometimes\u00a0be carried out to see if you carry the\u00a0HLA-B27 gene, which is found in most people with AS.\nThis can contribute towards a diagnosis of AS, but it is not entirely reliable as not everyone with\u00a0the condition\u00a0has this gene, and some people have the gene without ever developing AS.\nConfirming ankylosing spondylitis\nAlthough scans can sometimes show spinal inflammation and fusing of the spine (ankylosis), damage to the spine cannot always be picked up in the early stages of AS.\nThis is why\u00a0diagnosis is often difficult. In many cases, confirming a diagnosis is a long process that can take years.\nA diagnosis of AS can\u00a0usually\u00a0be confirmed if an X-ray shows sacroiliitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joints) and you have at least one of the following:\n\nat least three months of lower back pain that gets better with exercise and doesn't improve with rest\nlimited movement in your lumbar spine (lower back)\nlimited chest expansion compared to what is expected for your age and sex\n\nIf you have all three of these features but do not have sacroiliitis \u2013 or if you only have sacroiliitis \u2013 you will be diagnosed with \"probable ankylosing spondylitis\".\n\n\nThere is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis (AS), but treatment is available to help relieve the symptoms.\nTreatment can also help delay or prevent the process of the spine fusing (joining up) and stiffening.\nIn most cases, treatment will involve a combination of exercise, physiotherapy and medication, which are described below.\nPhysiotherapy and exercise\nKeeping active can improve your posture and range of spinal movement, along with preventing your spine from becoming stiff and painful.\nAs well as keeping active, physiotherapy is a key part of treating AS. A physiotherapist (a healthcare professional trained in using physical methods of treatment) can advise about the most effective exercises and draw up an exercise programme that suits you.\nTypes of physiotherapy recommended for AS include:\n\na group exercise programme \u2013 where you exercise with others\nan individual exercise programme \u2013 you are given exercises to do by yourself\nmassage \u2013 your muscles and other soft tissues are manipulated to relieve pain and improve movement (the bones of the spine should never be manipulated as this can cause injury in people with AS)\nhydrotherapy \u2013 exercise in water (usually a warm, shallow swimming pool or a special hydrotherapy bath); the\u00a0buoyancy of\u00a0the water helps make movement easier\u00a0by supporting you, and the warmth can relax your muscles\u00a0\n\nSome people prefer to swim or play sport to keep flexible. This is usually fine, although some daily stretching and exercise is also important.\nIf you're ever in doubt, speak to your physiotherapist or rheumatologist before taking up a new form of sport or exercise.\nThe National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS) provides detailed information about different types of exercise to help you manage your condition.\u00a0\nPainkillers\nYou may need painkillers to manage your condition while you are being referred to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist may continue prescribing painkillers, although not everyone needs them all the time.\nThe first type of painkiller usually prescribed is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). As well as helping to ease pain, NSAIDs can help relieve swelling (inflammation) in your joints.\nExamples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac.\nWhen prescribing NSAIDs, your GP or rheumatologist will try to find the one that suits you, and the lowest possible dose that relieves your symptoms. Your dose will be monitored and reviewed as necessary.\nIf NSAIDs are unsuitable for you, an alternative painkiller, such as paracetamol, may be recommended.\nParacetamol rarely causes side effects and can be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, paracetamol may not be suitable for people with liver problems or those dependent on alcohol.\nIf necessary, as well as paracetamol, you may also be prescribed a stronger type of painkiller called codeine.\nCodeine can cause side effects including\u00a0feeling sick, vomiting,\u00a0constipation and drowsiness.\nAnti-TNF medication\nIf your symptoms cannot be controlled using painkillers or exercising and stretching, anti-TNF (tumour necrosis factor) medication may be recommended. TNF is a chemical produced by cells when tissue is inflamed.\nAnti-TNF medications are given by injection and work by preventing the effects of TNF, as well as reducing inflammation in your joints caused by ankylosing spondylitis.\nExamples of anti-TNF medication include adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab.\nThese are relatively new treatments for AS, and their long-term effects are unknown.\nHowever, they have been used for longer in people with\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis,\u00a0and this is providing clearer information about their long-term safety.\nIf your rheumatologist recommends using anti-TNF medication, the decision about whether they are right for you must be discussed carefully and your progress will be closely monitored. This is because anti-TNF medication can interfere with the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system), increasing your risk of developing potentially serious infections.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance about the use of\u00a0anti-TNF medication for AS. NICE states that adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab may only be used if:\n\nyour diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis has been confirmed\nyour level of pain is assessed twice (using a simple scale that you fill in) 12 weeks apart and confirms your condition has not improved\nyour\u00a0Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is tested twice, 12 weeks apart, and confirms your condition\u00a0has not improved \u2013 BASDAI is a set of measures devised by experts to evaluate your condition, by asking a number of questions about your symptoms\ntreatment with two or more NSAIDs for four weeks at the highest possible dose has not controlled your symptoms\n\nAfter 12 weeks of treatment with anti-TNF medication, your pain score and BASDAI will be tested again to see whether they have improved enough to make continuing treatment worthwhile. If they have, treatment will continue and you will be tested every 12 weeks.\nIf there is not enough improvement after 12 weeks, you will be tested\u00a0again at a later date\u00a0or the treatment will be stopped.\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids have a powerful anti-inflammatory effect and can be taken as tablets or injections by people with AS.\nIf a particular joint is inflamed, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the joint. After the injection, you will need to rest the joint for up to 48 hours.\nIt is usually considered wise to have a corticosteroid injection up to three times in one year, with at least three months between injections in the same joint. This is because corticosteroids injections can cause a number of side effects, such as:\n\ninfection in response to the injection\nthe skin around the injection may change colour (depigmentation)\nthe surrounding tissue may waste away\na tendon (cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) near the joint may rupture (burst)\n\nCorticosteroids may also calm down painful swollen joints when taken as tablets.\nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are an alternative type of medication often used to treat other types of arthritis.\nDMARDs may be prescribed for AS, although they are only beneficial in treating pain and inflammation in joints in areas of the body other than the spine.\nTwo DMARDs sometimes used to treat inflammation of joints other than the spine include sulfasalazine and methotrexate.\nSurgery\nMost people with AS will not need surgery.\nHowever, in cases where a joint has become severely damaged,\u00a0joint replacement surgery may be recommended to improve pain and movement in the affect joint. For example, if the\u00a0hip joints are affected, a\u00a0hip replacement may be carried out.\nIn rare cases, corrective surgery may be needed\u00a0if the spine becomes badly bent.\nFollow-up\nAs the symptoms of\u00a0AS develop slowly and tend to come and go, you will need to see your rheumatologist or GP for regular check-ups.\nThey will make sure your treatment is working properly and may carry out physical assessments to assess how your condition is progressing. This may involve further sets of the same blood tests or X-rays you had at the time of your diagnosis.\nAny complications of ankylosing spondylitis that arise will be treated as they develop.\n\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) is a complex condition that can affect many parts of your body. It can cause complications in your day-to-day life and lead to additional health conditions.\nSome complications associated with AS are outlined below.\nReduced flexibility\nAlthough most people with AS remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term, around\u00a04 in every 10 people with the condition will eventually have severely restricted movement in their spine.\nThis usually only affects the lower back and is\u00a0the result of the bones in the spine fusing (joining up).\nFusing of the spine can make it difficult to move your back and can mean your\u00a0posture becomes fixed in one position,\u00a0although it doesn't\u00a0lead to severe disability in most cases.\nIn rare cases, surgery may be recommended to correct severe bends in the spine.\nJoint damage\nAS can cause joints such as the hips and knees to become inflamed.\u00a0This can damage\u00a0the affected joints over time, making them painful and difficult to move.\nIf a joint becomes particularly damaged, you may need surgery to replace it with an artificial one.\nIritis\nIritis, also known as anterior uveitis, is a condition sometimes associated with AS where the front part of the eye becomes red and swollen. It usually only affects one eye, rather than both.\nIf you have iritis, your eye may become red, painful and sensitive to light (photophobia). Your vision may also become blurred or cloudy.\nYou should visit your GP as soon as possible if you have AS and think you may have developed iritis, as the condition can cause the loss of some or all of your vision if not treated promptly.\nIf your GP thinks you have iritis, they will refer you urgently to an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specialises in eye problems) for treatment.\nIritis can usually be treated with corticosteroid eye drops.\nOsteoporosis and spinal fractures\nOsteoporosis\u00a0is where the bones become weak and brittle. In AS, osteoporosis can develop in the spine and can increase your risk of fracturing the bones in your backbone.\u00a0The longer you have the condition, the more this risk increases.\nIf you do develop osteoporosis, you will usually need to take medication to help strengthen your bones. There are a number of medications that can be used to treat osteoporosis, which can be taken by mouth (orally) as tablets or given by injection.\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0treating osteoporosis.\nCardiovascular disease\nIf you have AS, you may also have an increased risk of developing\u00a0cardiovascular disease (CVD).\u00a0CVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as\u00a0heart disease\u00a0and\u00a0stroke.\nDue to this increased risk, it is important to take steps to minimise your chances of developing\u00a0CVD.\nYour rheumatologist (a specialist in treating muscle and joint conditions) can advise about lifestyle changes you should make to minimise your risk of developing a CVD. These changes may include:\n\nstopping smoking \u2013 if you smoke\nlosing weight \u2013 if you are overweight or obese\ntaking regular exercise \u2013 150 minutes of exercise per week can greatly increase your health\nmaking changes to your diet to keep other conditions you may have under control \u2013 such as\u00a0diabetes or\u00a0high blood pressure\n\nYou may also be prescribed medication to reduce your blood pressure or blood cholesterol level.\nCauda equina syndrome\nCauda equina syndrome is a very rare complication of AS that occurs when nerves at the bottom of your spine become compressed (compacted).\nCauda equina syndrome causes:\n\npain or numbness in your lower back and buttocks\nweakness in your legs \u2013 which can affect your ability to walk\nurinary incontinence\u00a0or\u00a0bowel incontinence (when you cannot control your bladder or bowels)\n\nSee your GP as soon as possible if you have AS and you develop any of these symptoms.\nAmyloidosis\nIn very rare cases, it is possible to develop a condition called\u00a0amyloidosis as a complication of AS.\nAmyloid is a protein produced by cells in your bone marrow (the spongy material found in the centres of some hollow bones). Amyloidosis is a condition where amyloid builds up in organs such as your heart, kidneys and liver.\nAmyloidosis can cause a wide range of symptoms, including\u00a0fatigue, weight loss, fluid retention (oedema),\u00a0shortness of breath and numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.\nProblems with employment\nOver time,\u00a0AS\u00a0can increasingly affect your ability to work. Some people with the condition may be\u00a0unable to work at all and others\u00a0may need changes to their working life, such as working part-time, working from home\u00a0or avoiding physically demanding work.\nWhen at work, it is important to maintain a good posture when sitting or standing for long periods of time. You should get up, stretch and move around regularly. This could mean adjusting your work station or ensuring you take regular breaks.\u00a0\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder and a serious, potentially life-threatening, mental health condition.\nPeople who have anorexia are very anxious about their weight and body shape. They try to keep their weight as low as possible by strictly controlling and limiting what they eat. Many people with anorexia will also exercise excessively. They may also use other methods to try to control their weight, including using laxatives, vomiting after eating, and taking stimulant drugs.\nAnorexia causes people who have it to be afraid of being \u2018fat\u2019. This fear is what causes the other symptoms, leading to weight loss and potential health risks.\nRead more about anorexia symptoms\nEven when a person with anorexia becomes extremely underweight, they can still feel compelled to lose more weight, and see themselves as being \u2018fat\u2019.\nAnorexia causes people who have it to focus heavily on food, even when they won\u2019t eat it. For example, they might enjoy cooking for others, but avoid eating any of the meal themselves.\nSome people with anorexia binge eat, meaning they eat a lot of food (or what feels to them like a lot of food) in a short space of time. They then try to avoid digesting the food and gaining weight from it by \u2018purging\u2019 \u2013 either making themselves vomit or using laxatives (medication that causes you to poo).\nThe symptoms of anorexia usually begin gradually \u2013 someone might start a diet to help them lose a little bit of weight, but find that it spirals out of control.\nHow common is anorexia?\nDespite being an uncommon condition, anorexia is the leading cause of mental health-related deaths.\nAnorexia can affect anyone \u2013 it\u2019s more common in girls and women, with 1 in 100 women affected over the course of their lifetime. For men and boys, anorexia affects approximately 1 in 350 men over the course of their lifetime, and experts advise that it\u2019s becoming more common.\nSymptoms of anorexia usually first develop during the teenage years, on average at the age of 15, but it can develop at any time, including in childhood.\nThe cause of anorexia is unknown, but most experts believe the condition results from a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors.\nRead more about the causes of anorexia\nThe long-term malnutrition associated with anorexia can cause a range of serious complications, such as:\n\nosteoporosis (weakening of the bones)\nkidney disease\nheart failure\ninfertility\n\nRead more about the complications of anorexia\nTreating anorexia\nIt can be difficult for people with anorexia to recognise that they have a mental health condition. Because it\u2019s hard for them to get out of the habits they\u2019ve developed as a result of anorexia, recovery can take some time.\nMost people with anorexia respond to treatment, and the earlier it begins, the better the chances of a complete recovery. Treatment for anorexia usually involves talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which aim to change the person\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and behaviour around food. Nutritional support is also offered to help them gain weight safely.\nRead more about treating anorexia\n\n\nThere are 3 main symptoms of anorexia:\n\nfear of \u2018being fat\u2019 or gaining weight\nproblems with self-esteem and body image when it comes to food and weight\nrestricting food intake and keeping your body weight low, to the point it\u2019s unhealthy\n\nRestricting food intake means your body isn\u2019t getting enough energy or nutrition, which leads to other physical symptoms.\nHaving anorexia nervosa doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like food, or don\u2019t feel hungry \u2013 it means the mental health condition is preventing you from eating in a healthy way. People with anorexia are unable to think about food in the same way as people who don\u2019t have the condition. Instead of thinking about food as something you need to survive, someone with anorexia might be continually focused on how they can eat less, and think of different types of food as \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019.\nAnorexia can make it feel like you have to conceal your eating habits, for example by:\n\nhiding how much you\u2019ve eaten, or not eaten\navoiding eating around other people\ncoming up with reasons for not eating, like feeling ill, special dietary requirements, or telling people you ate before you saw them\n\nIn addition, you may find yourself thinking about food all the time.\nHow you feel about food and your body is very personal, so symptoms and thoughts related to anorexia aren\u2019t likely to be the same for everyone. However, there are certain ways of thinking that are common in people who have anorexia.\nAnorexia can cause you to think, for example:\n\nthat you\u2019re overweight or \u2018fat\u2019\nthat you\u2019re unattractive or ugly\nthat other people see you in a negative way \u2013 maybe that they\u2019ll find you ugly or judge you for the way you look\n\nAlso, people with anorexia often believe that they are worth more, and people will like them more, if they are thinner. They might wear baggy clothing to hide their bodies, and withdraw from social situations and hobbies.\nMany people will also do something called \u2018body-checking\u2019, which involves persistently and repeatedly:\n\nweighing themselves\nmeasuring themselves, such as their waist size\nchecking their body in the mirror\n\nMen with anorexia, in particular, can spend a lot of time focusing on their muscle mass, and trying to attain a specific body shape.\nAnorexia symptoms can make it difficult to concentrate, and cause you to have problems performing at school or work. People with anorexia often seem to lose interest in activities they used to enjoy, but they can seem very busy because of the time they spend thinking about food and weight.\nPeople with anorexia nervosa strictly control what they eat. For example, by:\n\nstrict dieting\ncounting the calories in food\navoiding food they think is fattening\neating only low-calorie food\nmissing meals (fasting)\nhiding food instead of eating it\ncutting food into tiny pieces \u2013 to make it less obvious that they\u2019ve eaten very little, and to make the food easier to swallow\ntaking appetite suppressants (which make you less hungry), or pills that claim to help your body digest food faster, or remove fat from food\n\nThey may also drink a lot of coffee, energy drinks, tea, and other fluids with caffeine to provide a short-term burst of energy without many calories.\nSome people with anorexia also use drugs known to cause weight loss, such as cocaine or amphetamines.\nThe compulsion to burn calories often draws people with anorexia to \u2018high-impact\u2019 activities, such as running, dancing or aerobics. Some people with anorexia will use any available opportunity to burn calories, such as pacing or preferring to stand rather than sit.\nPeople with anorexia may think they can avoid absorbing calories, and try to prevent it in various ways. This can involve making themselves vomit.\nSigns that someone is purging by vomiting can include:\n\nleaving the room immediately after eating\ndental problems, such as tooth decay or bad breath, caused by the acid in vomit damaging their teeth and mouth\nhard skin on their knuckles, caused by putting their fingers down their throat\n\nSomeone with anorexia might also try to make food pass through their body as quickly as possible. For example, by either taking:\n\nlaxatives (medication that helps to empty the bowels)\ndiuretics (medication that helps remove fluid from the body)\n\nIn reality, vomiting, laxatives and diuretics all have little effect on the calories absorbed from food.\nEating too little for a long time can result in physical symptoms, such as:\n\nfine downy hair (lanugo) growing on the body\nmore hair on the face\npubic hair becoming sparse and thin\nslow or irregular heartbeat\n\nPeople with anorexia may also:\n\nhave pain in their abdomen (tummy)\nfeel bloated or constipated\nhave swelling in their feet, hands or face\nfeel very tired\nhave low blood pressure (hypotension)\nfeel cold or have a low body temperature\nfeel light-headed or dizzy\n\nIn children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. They may gain less weight than expected for someone going through puberty, and they might be shorter than other people of the same age.\nWomen and older girls with anorexia may stop having their periods. Anorexia can also lead to infertility, for both men and women.\n\n\nThe exact causes of anorexia nervosa are unclear, but most specialists believe it's likely to be the result of a combination of factors.\nMany people who develop anorexia share certain patterns of thinking and behaving that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include:\n\na tendency towards depression and anxiety\nfinding it difficult to handle stress\nfrequently worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future\nperfectionism \u2013 setting strict, demanding goals or standards\nfinding it hard to express feelings\nexperiencing unwanted thoughts, images or urges that make them feel they have to behave in certain ways\n\nEnvironmental factors are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.\nPuberty can be an important factor contributing to anorexia. This is likely due to the combination of hormonal changes and feelings of stress, anxiety and low self-esteem during puberty.\nWestern culture and society may also play a part. People of all ages are exposed to a wide range of media messages promoting the idea that only certain body shapes are desirable, and that not having the \u2018ideal\u2019 body is something to be ashamed of. Even health advice that\u2019s intended to be helpful can have a focus on the risks of being overweight, which can add to feelings of pressure and low self-esteem.\nThe media also places significant focus on celebrities\u2019 bodies, pointing out things like cellulite or slight weight gain. This can make people feel insecure about these parts of their own bodies.\nOther environmental factors that can contribute towards anorexia include:\n\npressure and stress at school, such as exams or bullying \u2013 particularly if someone is bullied about body weight or shape\noccupations or hobbies where being thin is seen as the ideal, such as dancing or athletics\nhaving a family that places high value on being thin and physically active, and praises or rewards weight loss\na stressful life event, such as losing a job, the breakdown of a relationship, or bereavement\ndifficult family relationships\nphysical or sexual abuse\n\nExperts have suggested changes in brain function or hormone levels may also have a role in anorexia, although it's not clear if these lead to anorexia or if they develop later as a result of malnutrition.\nThese changes may affect the part of the brain that controls appetite, or may lead to feelings of anxiety and guilt when eating. These feelings are then eased when meals are missed, or after excessive exercise.\nThe risk of someone developing anorexia is also thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders, depression, or substance misuse, which suggests higher chances of developing these conditions could run in the family.\n\n\nWhen making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your weight and eating habits. For example, they could ask:\n\nif you\u2019ve lost a lot of weight recently or quite quickly\nhow you feel about your weight, and if you\u2019re concerned about it\nif you think you\u2019re overweight, even though other people think you\u2019re thin\nif you make yourself vomit regularly\nif you have periods, whether your periods have stopped and if so, for how long\n\nIt\u2019s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn\u2019t trying to judge you or \u2018catch you out\u2019. They just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are.\nYour GP may check your weight. If someone has anorexia nervosa, their weight is generally at least 15% below average for their age, sex and height.\nYour GP may also calculate your body mass index (BMI). A healthy BMI for adults in Scotland is 20-25. People with anorexia generally have a BMI below 17.5.\nFind out how to calculate your BMI\nYour GP may not need to carry out any tests to diagnose anorexia nervosa, but they\u2019ll probably check your pulse and blood pressure.\nIf you have anorexia, you have a higher risk of developing some heart conditions, such as irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Sometimes an ECG (electrocardiogram) may be needed to check how well your heart is working.\nYour GP may do blood tests to check the level of:\n\nfluids in your body\nchemicals or minerals, such as potassium in your blood\n\nBlood tests look for the complications of anorexia, so even if they come back as \u2018normal\u2019, it\u2019s still likely you\u2019ll benefit from a referral to a specialist if you\u2019re experiencing anorexia symptoms.\nRead more about the complications of anorexia\nIf your GP thinks you may have anorexia, they\u2019ll refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment. Your GP sometimes carries out this assessment.\nRead more about treating anorexia\n\n\nBefore your treatment begins, you will probably have an overall assessment of your health. This may be done by your GP or another healthcare professional, such as one that specialises in eating disorders.\nThe assessment will help your healthcare professional draw up a plan for your treatment and care. For example, they may assess:\n\nyour overall health and any medical needs\nyour social situation, such as how much support you have from family and friends\nyour mood and any risks that affect you, such as whether you're at risk of harming yourself\nwhether there are any physical risks as a result of anorexia that mean urgent treatment is needed\n\nIf you are diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, your GP will probably be involved in your ongoing treatment and care. Other healthcare professionals may also be involved in your treatment, such as:\n\na specialist counsellor\na psychiatrist (doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions)\na psychologist or psychotherapist\na nurse\na dietician (specialist in nutrition)\n\nIf a child or teenager has anorexia, a paediatrician (doctor who specialises in children) may also be involved in their treatment.\nWhere you are treated may depend on how mild or severe your condition is. For example, you may be treated:\n\nas an outpatient (this is most common)\nas a day patient or in a day unit\nas in inpatient in hospital, if your weight loss or symptoms are severe\n\nIn some areas, eating disorders such as anorexia are treated by community mental health teams, which are made up of different health and social care professionals.\nIn other areas, there are units that specialise in treating eating disorders. Some services that treat eating disorders also specialise in treating young people.\nIt\u2019s important to start treatment as early as possible, especially if someone has already lost a lot of weight.\nTreatment for anorexia usually includes:\n\npsychological treatment \u2013 talking to a therapist or counsellor\nadvice on eating and nutrition to help you gain weight safely\n\nThese treatments work better when combined, rather than on their own.\nYour physical health will be monitored closely during your treatment. For example:\n\nyour weight will be checked regularly\nyou may have regular health checks with your GP or another healthcare professional\n\nIn children and young people with anorexia, their growth, development and weight will be monitored closely. Their height will also be checked regularly against the average for their age and sex.\nOther health problems caused by anorexia will also be treated. For example, if you vomit regularly, you\u2019ll be encouraged to stop. You\u2019ll be given advice on dental hygiene to help prevent stomach acid damaging the enamel on your teeth. You\u2019ll also be advised to visit a dentist regularly. If you take laxatives or diuretics, you\u2019ll be advised to reduce them gradually so your body can adjust. Stopping them suddenly can cause side effects like nausea and constipation.\nYour care team will give you advice on how to increase the amount you eat so you can gain weight safely.\nThey\u2019ll ask about your current eating habits and how much fluid you drink, as well as habits like smoking and drinking alcohol. This will determine what advice they give you, and help them identify any deficiencies in your diet, such as a lack of vitamins.\nYour care team will help you to develop healthy eating habits, such as eating more, eating more healthily, and increasing the nutritional benefits you get from food.\nYour body will likely need time to adjust to eating more. You may need to start by eating small amounts of food, and then gradually increasing what you eat.\nYou may need to take supplements, such as multivitamins or multiminerals, to adjust the chemical balance in your body. Some experts think this should be done before you start gaining weight.\nYou and your care team will work towards establishing a regular pattern of eating, with three meals a day and regular snacks. Your care team might agree a target weight with you, so you have a minimum healthy weight to aim for.\nIf your weight loss is severe, treatment in hospital may be needed to help you start to gain weight. Your health will be closely monitored to avoid any side effects, particularly in the first few days.\nVarious types of psychological treatment can be used to treat anorexia, such as:\n\ncognitive analytic therapy (CAT)\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\ninterpersonal therapy (IPT)\nfocal psychodynamic therapy (FPT)\nfamily therapy\n\nThese different types of psychological treatments are discussed below.\nCAT is based on the theory that mental health conditions like anorexia are caused by unhealthy patterns of behaviour and thinking, which a person has developed in their past, usually in their childhood.\nCBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. If anorexia is causing someone to behave in an unhealthy way, CBT helps them to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how they think about food, eating, and weight.\nIPT is based on the idea that relationships with other people and the outside world in general have a range of effects on your mental health, both positive and negative. IPT explores the way you interact with other people and the relationships you have, with the goal of improving them.\nPrevious experiences, particularly from childhood, can influence the way you think and feel now in ways you\u2019re not aware of. The aim of FPT is to help you become aware of those effects, so you can understand why you think and feel the way you do about food, eating, and weight.\nAnorexia doesn\u2019t just affect one person \u2013 it can also have a big impact on their family.\nFamily therapy involves the person with anorexia and close members of their family discussing how anorexia has affected them, and the positive changes the person and their family can make.\nLearn more about talking therapies\nThe types of therapy available can vary depending on where you live. Although different types of therapy take different approaches, the most important part of any talking therapy is the relationship you build with your therapist.\nMedication alone isn\u2019t usually effective in reducing anorexia symptoms. For some people it can be helpful to prescribe medication in combination with psychological treatment.\nYour treatment team might prescribe nutritional or vitamin supplements for you to help your overall health.\nIf treatment isn\u2019t improving your symptoms, or you start to get worse, your healthcare professional may consider changing your treatment. This may include treatment in hospital if your health is seriously at risk.\nSometimes the physical health issues caused by anorexia mean a person has to be admitted to hospital. If their life is at risk and they refuse treatment, there are some circumstances when they might be admitted under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2015. This is sometimes called \u2018being sectioned\u2019.\nSomeone can only receive compulsory treatment if their condition is preventing them from making informed decisions about their care.\nIt\u2019s quite common for anorexia to return after treatment \u2013 this is often referred to as relapse. It can happen, for example:\n\nif someone\u2019s weight starts to fall again\nafter having a baby, when a woman tries to lose the weight she gained during pregnancy\nduring stressful times in a person\u2019s life\n\nSometimes, anorexia can lead to another eating disorder called bulimia nervosa, where the person binge eats, then immediately makes themselves sick or uses laxatives to rid their body of the food.\n\n\nIf someone has anorexia for a long time, it can lead to severe complications and health problems that can sometimes be permanent.\nPeople with anorexia have an increased risk of:\n\npoor circulation and cardiovascular problems\nheart conditions, such as coronary heart disease and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\nhealth problems caused by malnutrition \u2013 a lack of vitamins and minerals\n\nAnorexia can cause an imbalance of minerals in the blood, such as potassium, calcium and sodium. These minerals play an important part in keeping you healthy. When there\u2019s an imbalance, it can cause symptoms like:\n\ntiredness\nweakness\ndehydration\nfits\nirregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)\nmuscle spasms\nconfusion\n\nOther conditions that can be caused by anorexia and malnutrition can include:\n\nlow blood pressure (hypotension)\nanaemia\ndental problems, such as tooth decay caused by regular vomiting (stomach acid affects the enamel on the teeth)\nlow blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia)\nacute kidney (renal) failure\nliver damage\nheart failure\nosteoporosis (fragile bones) and loss of muscle strength, particularly in women and girls\nloss of sex drive (libido) and impotency in men\n\nMisuse of laxatives can damage the bowels and cause permanent constipation.\nIf you have anorexia and another health condition, you\u2019ll need to take extra care of your health.\nIf you have diabetes, you\u2019ll need regular health checks to help avoid problems with your eyes or other serious complications. This is particularly important if you have type 1 diabetes.\nIf you have a bone condition, such as osteoporosis, your GP will probably advise you to avoid any physical activities that may lead to falls.\nAnorexia can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, or cause your periods to stop altogether. This doesn\u2019t mean anorexia makes you infertile \u2013 if you have anorexia, even if your periods are irregular or have stopped, you should continue to use birth control if you aren\u2019t planning a pregnancy.\nIf you have anorexia and are trying to become pregnant, you should discuss your plans with your GP and care team.\nIf you are pregnant, your midwife will monitor your health closely during your pregnancy and after your baby is born. You may need extra health checks as part of your antenatal and postnatal care.\nAnorexia during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications, such as:\n\nmiscarriage\ngiving birth early (premature birth)\nhaving a baby with a low birth weight\n\nHaving anorexia during pregnancy can also increase the chances that you\u2019ll need to have a caesarean section (C-section).\nYou\u2019re also likely to need extra care and support during pregnancy if you have previously had anorexia and recovered from it.\n\n\nIf someone has anorexia, the most important step towards diagnosis and treatment is for them to:\n\nrecognise they need help\nwant to get better\n\nHowever, to take this first step they may need lots of support and encouragement. Because one of the main symptoms of anorexia is a fear of gaining weight, it\u2019s understandable that people who have the condition can be anxious about seeking treatment that might mean eating more.\nIf you have eating problems or think you may have anorexia, it\u2019s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:\n\ntalking to someone you trust, such as a friend or member of your family\ngoing to see your GP \u2013 you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support\n\nIf someone close to you is showing signs of anorexia, you can offer help and support.\nYou could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.\nIf you\u2019d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own GP, can provide information on:\n\nhow to help the person recognise that they have a problem\nthe treatments available\nhow you can support them during their treatment\n\nYou could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders. Your own GP or Scotland\u2019s Service Directory can help you find services near you.\nA leading charity for people with eating disorders is Beat, which has a range of information on the help and support available for people with eating disorders, and their friends and families.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe.\nEveryone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal.\nHowever, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily life.\nAnxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including panic disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nHowever, the information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).\nGeneralised anxiety disorder (GAD)\nGAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event.\nPeople with GAD feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. GAD can cause both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. These vary from person to person, but can include feeling restless or worried and having trouble concentrating or sleeping.\nRead about the symptoms of GAD\nAlthough feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, you should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.\nYour GP will ask you about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions to try to find out if you could have GAD.\nRead more about diagnosing GAD\nThe exact cause of GAD is not fully understood, although it's likely that a combination of several factors plays a role. Research has suggested these may include:\n\noveractivity in areas of the brain involved in emotions and behaviour\nan imbalance of the brain chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline, which are involved in the control and regulation of mood\nthe genes you inherit from your parents \u2013 you're estimated to be five times more likely to develop GAD if you have a close relative with the condition\nhaving a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, such as domestic violence, child abuse or bullying\nhaving a painful long-term health condition, such as arthritis\nhaving a history of drug or alcohol misuse\n\nHowever, many people develop GAD for no apparent reason.\nGAD is a common condition estimated to affect about 1 in every 25 people in the UK.\nSlightly more women are affected than men, and the condition is more common in people between the ages of 35 and 55.\nGAD can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different treatments are available that can help ease your symptoms. These include:\n\npsychological therapy\u2013 such as\u00a0cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\nmedication \u2013 such as a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n\nThere are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, such as going on a self-help course, exercising regularly, stopping smoking and cutting down on the amount of alcohol and caffeine you drink.\nWith treatment, many people are able to control their levels of anxiety. However, some treatments may need to be continued for a long time and there may be periods where your symptoms worsen.\nRead more about treating GAD and self-help tips for GAD\n\n\nGeneralised anxiety disorder (GAD) can affect you both physically and mentally.\nHow severe the symptoms are varies from person to person. Some people have only one or two symptoms, while others have many more.\nYou should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.\nPsychological symptoms of GAD\nGAD can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things, resulting in symptoms such as:\n\nrestlessness\na sense of dread\nfeeling constantly \"on edge\"\ndifficulty concentrating\nirritability\n\nYour symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact (seeing your family and friends) to avoid feelings of worry and dread.\nYou may also find going to work difficult and stressful and may take time off sick. These actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem.\nPhysical symptoms of GAD\nGAD can also have a number of physical symptoms, including:\n\ndizziness\ntiredness\na noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)\nmuscle aches and tension\ntrembling or shaking\ndry mouth\nexcessive sweating\nshortness of breath\nstomach ache\nfeeling sick\nheadache\npins and needles\ndifficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia)\n\nAnxiety triggers\nIf you are anxious as a result of a specific phobia or because of panic disorder, you will usually know what the cause is. For example, if you have claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed spaces), you know that being confined in a small space will trigger your anxiety.\nHowever, if you have GAD, it may not always be clear what you are feeling anxious about. Not knowing what triggers your anxiety can intensify it and you may start to worry that there will be no solution.\n\n\nSee your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.\nGeneralised anxiety disorder (GAD) can be difficult to diagnose. In some cases, it can also be difficult to distinguish from other mental health conditions, such as depression.\nTalking to your GP about anxiety\nYour GP may ask you questions about your worries, fears and emotions. They may also ask about your personal life. Tell your GP about all your symptoms \u2013 physical and psychological \u2013 and explain how long you have had them for.\nYou may find it difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life. However, it is important that your GP understands your symptoms and circumstances so that the correct diagnosis can be made.\nYou are most likely to be diagnosed with GAD if you have had the symptoms for six months or more. Finding it difficult to manage your feelings of anxiety is also an indication that you may have the condition.\nTo help with the diagnosis, your GP may carry out a physical examination or blood tests to rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms, such as anaemia (a deficiency in iron or vitamin B12 and folate) or an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).\nDo you have GAD?\nYou may have generalised anxiety disorder if:\n\nyour worrying significantly affects your daily life, including your job and social life\nyour worries are extremely stressful and upsetting\nyou worry about all sorts of things and have a tendency to think the worst\nyour worrying is uncontrollable\nyou have felt worried nearly every day for at least six months\n\n\n\nGeneralised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a long-term condition, but a number of different treatments can help.\nBefore you begin any form of treatment, your GP should discuss all your treatment options with you. They should outline the pros and cons of each and make sure you are aware of any possible risks or side effects.\nWith your GP, you can make a decision on the treatment most suited to you, taking into account your personal preferences and circumstances.\nIf you have other problems alongside GAD, such as depression and drug or alcohol misuse, these may need to be treated before having treatment specifically for GAD.\nInitial treatment\nAt first, your GP may suggest trying an individual self-help course for a month or two to see if it can help you learn to cope with your anxiety.\nThis will usually involve working from a book or computer programme on your own (you will be given advice about how to use the book or programme before you start), with only occasional contact with your doctor.\nAlternatively, you may prefer to go on a group course where you and a few other people with similar problems meet with a therapist every week to learn ways to tackle your anxiety.\nRead more\u00a0about these treatments\nIf these initial treatments do not help, you will usually be offered either a more intensive psychological treatment or medication. These are described below.\nPsychological treatment\nIf you have been diagnosed with GAD, you will usually be advised to try psychological treatment before you are prescribed medication.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for GAD. Studies of different treatments for GAD have found that the benefits of CBT may last longer than those of medication, but no single treatment is best for everyone.\nCBT helps you to understand how your problems, thoughts, feelings and behaviour affect each other. It can also help you to question your negative and anxious thoughts, and do things you would usually avoid because they make you anxious.\nCBT will usually involve meeting with a specially trained and accredited therapist for a one-hour session every week for three to four months.\nYour therapist should carry out CBT in a standardised way according to a treatment manual, and they should receive regular supervision to support them in providing the most effective treatments.\nApplied relaxation is an alternative type of psychological treatment that can be as effective as CBT in treating GAD.\nApplied relaxation focuses on relaxing your muscles in a particular way during situations that usually cause anxiety. The technique needs to be taught by a trained therapist, but generally involves:\n\nlearning how to relax your muscles\nlearning how to relax your muscles quickly and in response to a trigger, such as the word \"relax\"\npractising relaxing your muscles in situations that make you anxious\n\nAs with CBT, applied relaxation therapy will usually mean meeting with a therapist for a one-hour session every week for three to four months.\nMedication\nIf the psychological treatments above have not helped you or you would prefer not to try them, you will usually be offered medication.\nYour GP can prescribe a variety of different types of medication to treat GAD. Some medication is designed to be taken on a short-term basis, while other medicines are prescribed for longer periods.\nDepending on your symptoms, you may require medicine to treat your physical symptoms as well as your psychological ones.\nIf you are considering taking medication for GAD, your GP should discuss the different options with you in detail, including the different types of medication, length of treatment, side effects and possible interactions with other medicines, before you start a course of treatment.\nYou should also have regular appointments with your doctor to assess your progress when you are taking medication for GAD. These will usually take place every two to four weeks for the first three months, then every three months after that.\nTell your GP if you think you may be experiencing side effects from your medication. They may be able to adjust your dose or prescribe an alternative medication.\nThe main medications you may be offered to treat GAD are described below.\nIn most cases, the first medication you will be offered will be a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This type of medication works by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain.\nExamples of SSRIs you may be prescribed include sertraline, escitalopram and paroxetine.\nSSRIs can be taken on a long-term basis but, as with all antidepressants, they can take several weeks to start working. You will usually be started on a low dose, which will gradually be increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.\nCommon side effects of SSRIs include:\n\nfeeling sick\nlow sex drive\nblurred vision\ndiarrhoea or constipation\ndizziness\ndry mouth\nloss of appetite\nsweating\nfeeling agitated\nproblems sleeping (insomnia)\n\nSome of the side effects \u2013 such as feeling sick, an upset stomach, problems sleeping and feeling agitated or more anxious \u2013 are more common in the first one or two weeks of treatment, but these will usually settle as your body adjusts to the medication.\nIf you or your GP feels that your medication is not helping after about two months of treatment, or if it is causing unpleasant side effects, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI to see if that has any effect.\nWhen you and your GP decide that it is appropriate for you to stop taking your medication, you will normally have your dose slowly reduced over the course of a few weeks to reduce the risk of withdrawal effects. Never stop taking your medication unless your GP specifically advises you to.\nIf SSRIs do not help ease your anxiety, you may be prescribed a different type of antidepressant known as a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). This type of medicine increases the amount of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.\nExamples of SNRIs you may be prescribed include venlafaxine and duloxetine.\nCommon side effects of SNRIs include:\n\nfeeling sick\nheadaches\ndrowsiness\ndizziness\ndry mouth\nconstipation\ninsomnia\nsweating\n\nSNRIs can also increase your blood pressure, so your blood pressure will be monitored regularly during treatment.\nAs with SSRIs, some of the side effects \u2013 such as feeling sick, an upset stomach, problems sleeping and feeling agitated or more anxious \u2013 are more common in the first one or two weeks of treatment, but these will usually settle as your body adjusts to the medication.\nIf SSRIs and SNRIs are not suitable for you, you may be offered pregabalin. This is a medication known as an anticonvulsant, which is used to treat conditions such as epilepsy (a condition that causes repeated seizures). However, it has also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety.\nSide effects of pregabalin can include:\n\ndrowsiness\ndizziness\nincreased appetite and weight gain\nblurred vision\nheadaches\ndry mouth\nvertigo (the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning)\n\nPregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs or SNRIs.\nBenzodiazepines are a type of sedative that may sometimes be used as a short-term treatment during a particularly severe period of anxiety because they help ease the symptoms within 30 to 90 minutes of taking the medication.\nExamples of benzodiazepines you may be prescribed include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and lorazepam.\nAlthough benzodiazepines are very effective in treating the symptoms of anxiety, they cannot be used for long periods of time because they can become addictive if used for longer than four weeks. Benzodiazepines also start to lose their effectiveness after this time.\nFor these reasons, you will not usually be prescribed benzodiazepines for any longer than two to four weeks at a time.\nSide effects of benzodiazepines can include:\n\ndrowsiness\ndifficulty concentrating\nheadaches\nvertigo\ntremor (an uncontrollable shake or tremble in part of the body)\nlow sex drive\n\nAs drowsiness is a particularly common side effect of benzodiazepines, your ability to drive or operate machinery may be affected by taking this medication. You should therefore avoid these activities during treatment.\nReferral to a specialist\nIf you have tried the treatments mentioned above and have significant symptoms of GAD, you may want to discuss with your GP whether you should be referred to a mental health specialist.\nA referral will work differently in different areas of the UK, but you will usually be referred to your community mental health team. These teams include a range of specialists, including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers.\nAn appropriate mental health specialist from your local team will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. They will ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it.\nThey may also ask about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends.\nYour specialist will then be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to effectively treat your symptoms.\nAs part of this plan, you may be offered a treatment you have not tried before, which might be one of the psychological treatments or medications mentioned above.\nAlternatively, you may be offered a combination of a psychological treatment with a medication, or a combination of two different medications.\n\n\nIf you have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), there are many ways you can help ease the symptoms of anxiety yourself.\nAnxiety self-help guide\nOur mental health self-help guides are based on\u00a0Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)\u00a0and have proven highly successful in helping people with\u00a0anxiety and other mental health issues.\nWork through a self-help guide for anxiety that uses Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).\nTry a book or online course\nWhen you are diagnosed with GAD, your GP may recommend trying self-help treatments before having more intensive psychological therapy or medication.\nThis will usually involve working from a book or computer programme for around six weeks or longer. In some cases, you may be closely supported by a trained therapist who you will speak to every week or two, although some treatments only involve minimal or occasional contact with a therapist who will monitor your progress.\nThere are a number of different books and courses available that can help you learn to cope with your anxiety, but the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends trying treatments based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nCBT is a type of psychological treatment that can help you understand your condition better and how your problems, thoughts, feelings and behaviour affect each other. The aim of CBT-based treatments is to help you learn ways to manage your anxiety by modifying negative or unhelpful behaviour and thoughts.\nFind out more about\u00a0Living Life\u00a0- a service which offers appointment-based telephone support based upon cognitive behavioural therapy.\nExercise regularly\nRegular exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, may help you combat stress and release tension. It also encourages your brain to release the chemical serotonin, which can improve your mood.\nExamples of good aerobic exercises to try include:\n\nwalking\u00a0fast or\u00a0jogging\nswimming\ncycling\ntennis\nhiking\nfootball\u00a0or rugby\naerobics\n\nYou should aim to do a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week. Moderate-intensity exercise should raise your heart rate and make you breathe faster.\nLearn to relax\nAs well as getting regular exercise, learning how to relax is important.\nYou may find relaxation and breathing exercises helpful, or you may prefer activities such as yoga or pilates to help you unwind.\nAvoid caffeine\nDrinking too much caffeine can make you more anxious than normal. This is because caffeine can disrupt your sleep and also speed up your heartbeat. If you are tired, you are less likely to be able to control your anxious feelings.\nAvoiding drinks containing caffeine \u2013 such as coffee, tea, fizzy drinks and energy drinks \u2013 may help reduce your anxiety levels.\nAvoid smoking and drinking\nSmoking and alcohol have been shown to make feelings of anxiety worse. Only drinking alcohol in moderation or\u00a0stopping smoking\u00a0if you smoke may help reduce your anxiety.\nThe Department of Health recommends that men should not drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women no more than two to three units.\nContact support groups\nSupport groups can give you useful advice about how to effectively manage your anxiety. They are also a good way to meet other people with similar experiences.\nExamples of support groups you may find useful include:\n\nAnxiety Alliance\nAnxiety UK\nMind\nRethink Mental Illness\n\nSupport groups can often arrange face-to-face meetings, where you can talk about your difficulties and problems with other people. Many support groups also provide support and guidance over the phone or in writing.\nAsk your GP about local support groups for anxiety in your area or search our support service directory for mental health information and support services near you.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix.

If these options aren't available, call NHS 24 111 Service for advice.\nYou should call 999 for an ambulance if you have sudden pain that continues to get worse and spreads across your abdomen.\nThese are signs your appendix may have burst, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.\nRead more about:\u00a0\ndiagnosing appendicitis\u00a0\ncomplications of appendicitis\nHow appendicitis is treated\nIn most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible.\nRemoval of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent.\nThe operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted.\nOpen surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult.\nMost people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6\u00a0weeks after open surgery.\u00a0\nRead more\u00a0about treating appendicitis.\nWhat causes appendicitis?\nIt's not exactly clear what the causes of appendicitis are. Most cases are thought to occur when something\u00a0blocks the entrance of the appendix.\nFor example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of\u00a0faeces or an upper\u00a0respiratory tract infection\u00a0could lead to\u00a0a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel.\nThis obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting.\nAs the causes aren't fully understood, there's no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis.\nWho's affected?\nAppendicitis is a common condition. Around 40,000 people are admitted to hospital with appendicitis each year in England.\nIt's estimated around\u00a01 in every 13 people develop it at some point in their life.\nAppendicitis can develop at any age, but it's most common in young people aged from 10 to 20 years old.\n\n\nAppendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.\nWithin hours, the pain travels to your lower right-hand side, where the appendix is usually located, and becomes constant and severe.\nPressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse.\nIf you have appendicitis, you may also have other symptoms, including:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nbeing sick\nloss of appetite\ndiarrhoea\na high temperature (fever) and a flushed face\n\nWhen to get medical help\nIf you're experiencing\u00a0abdominal pain that's gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local\u00a0out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren't available, call NHS 24 111 Service for advice.\nAppendicitis can easily be confused with something else, such as:\n\ngastroenteritis\nsevere\u00a0irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nconstipation\nbladder or\u00a0urine infections\nCrohn's disease\npelvic infection\n\nIn young women, these symptoms can sometimes have a gynaecological cause, such as an ectopic pregnancy or menstrual pain.\nHowever, any condition that causes constant stomach pain requires urgent medical attention.\nYou should call 999 for an ambulance if you get a pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst.\nIf the appendix bursts, it can cause\u00a0peritonitis, a potentially serious infection of the inner lining of the abdomen.\nRead more about the complications of appendicitis.\n\n\nAppendicitis can be tricky to diagnose unless you have the typical symptoms, which are only present in about half of all cases.\nAlso, some people's appendixes may be located in a slightly different part of their body, such as:\n\nthe pelvis\nbehind the large intestine\naround the small bowel\nnear the right lower part of the liver\n\nSome people develop pain similar to appendicitis, but it's caused by something else, such as:\n\ngastroenteritis\nsevere\u00a0irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nconstipation\na bladder or\u00a0urine infection\n\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms, examine your abdomen, and see if the pain gets worse when pressure is applied to the appendix area (your lower right-hand side).\nIf your symptoms are typical of appendicitis, this is normally enough for your GP to make a confident diagnosis. In\u00a0this case, you'll immediately be referred to hospital for treatment.\nFurther tests\nIf your symptoms aren't typical, further tests may be required in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\nFurther tests may involve:\u00a0\n\na\u00a0blood test to look for signs of infection\na pregnancy test\u00a0for women\na urine test to rule out other conditions, such as a bladder infection\nan ultrasound scan\u00a0to see if the appendix is swollen\na\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan\n\nIt can sometimes take\u00a0time to get test results. Your surgeon may recommend a laparoscopy to inspect your appendix and pelvic organs if the diagnosis is still uncertain.\nYou'll usually\u00a0be advised to have your appendix removed if appendicitis is suspected, rather than run the risk of it bursting. This means some people will have their appendix removed even though it's eventually found to be normal.\nIn some cases where a diagnosis is not certain, a doctor may recommend waiting up to 24 hours to see if your symptoms improve, stay the same, or get worse.\nIf your doctor suspects your appendix has burst, you'll be sent to hospital immediately for treatment.\nRead more about\u00a0treating appendicitis.\n\n\nIf you have appendicitis, your appendix usually needs to be removed as soon as possible. This operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy.\nSurgery is usually\u00a0also recommended if there's a chance you have appendicitis but it's not been possible to make a clear diagnosis.\nThis is because it's considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting.\nIn humans, the appendix doesn't perform any important function and having it removed doesn't cause any long-term problems.\nThe procedure\nAppendectomies are carried out under\u00a0general anaesthetic using either a keyhole or open technique.\nKeyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is usually the preferred method of removing the appendix because the recovery tends to be quicker than with open surgery.\nThis operation involves making 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0small cuts (incisions) in your tummy (abdomen). Special instruments are then inserted, including:\n\na tube that gas is pumped through\u00a0to inflate your abdomen \u2013 this allows the surgeon to see your appendix more clearly and gives them more room to work\na laparoscope\u00a0\u2013 a small tube containing a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen to a television monitor\nsmall surgical tools used to remove the appendix\n\nOnce the appendix has been removed, the incisions will usually be closed with dissolvable\u00a0stitches.\u00a0Regular stitches\u00a0may also be used, which need to be removed at your GP surgery 7 to 10 days later.\nIn some circumstances, keyhole surgery isn't recommended and open surgery is performed instead. These include:\n\nwhen the appendix has already burst and formed a lump called an appendix mass\nwhen the surgeon isn't very experienced in laparoscopic removal\npeople who have previously had open abdominal surgery\n\nIn these cases, the operation involves making a single larger cut in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen to remove the appendix.\nWhen there's widespread peritonitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0infection of the inner lining of the abdomen\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it's sometimes necessary to operate through a long cut along the middle of the abdomen in a procedure called a laparotomy.\nAs with keyhole surgery, the incision\u00a0is closed using either dissolvable stitches or regular stitches\u00a0that need to be removed at a later date.\u00a0\nAfter both types of surgery, the removed appendix is routinely sent to a laboratory to check there are no signs of cancer. This is a precautionary measure, although it's rare for a serious problem to be found.\nRecovery\nOne of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation.\nIf the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. With open or complicated surgery\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have peritonitis\u00a0\u2013 it may\u00a0take up to\u00a0a week before you're well enough to go home.\nFor the first few days after the operation you're likely to experience some pain and bruising. This improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary.\nIf you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. This is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation.\nYou may also experience some short-term constipation. You can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and\u00a0staying well hydrated. Your GP can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome.\nBefore leaving hospital, you'll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid.\nIn most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks after open surgery.\nWhile you recover, it's important to keep an eye out for signs of any problems.\nContact the hospital unit where the appendectomy was performed or your GP for advice if you notice:\n\nincreasing pain and swelling\nyou start vomiting repeatedly\na high temperature (fever)\nany discharge coming from the wound\nthe wound is hot to touch\n\nThese symptoms could be a sign of infection.\nRisks\nAppendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the UK, and serious or long-term complications are rare.\nHowever, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. These include:\n\nantibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections\nbleeding under the skin that causes a firm swelling (haematoma) \u2013 this usually gets better on its own, but you should see your GP if you're concerned\nscarring \u2013 both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made\na collection of pus (abscess) \u2013 in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery\nhernia \u2013 at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approach\n\nThe use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading to pneumonia. However, serious complications like this are very rare.\nAlternatives to emergency surgery\nIn some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass.\nThis lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself.\nIf an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it's not necessary to operate immediately.\nInstead, you'll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled.\nAnother possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis.\nHowever, studies have looked into whether antibiotics could be an alternative to surgery and as yet there isn't enough clear evidence to suggest this is the case.\n\n\nIf appendicitis isn't treated, the appendix can burst and cause potentially life-threatening infections.\nCall 999 for an ambulance if you have abdominal (tummy) pain that suddenly gets much worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst.\nPeritonitis\nIf your appendix bursts, it releases bacteria into other parts of the body. This can cause a condition called peritonitis if the infection spreads to the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen.\nSymptoms of peritonitis can include:\n\nsevere continuous abdominal pain\nfeeling sick or being sick\na high temperature (fever)\na rapid heartbeat\nshortness of breath\u00a0with rapid breathing\nswelling of the abdomen\n\nIf peritonitis isn't treated immediately, it can cause long-term problems and may even be fatal. Treatment for peritonitis usually involves antibiotics and the surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy).\nAbscesses\nSometimes an\u00a0abscess forms around a burst appendix. This is a painful collection of pus that occurs as a result of the body's attempt to fight the infection.\u00a0\nIt can also occur as a complication of surgery to remove the appendix in about 1 in 500 cases.\nAbscesses can sometimes be treated using antibiotics, but in the vast majority of cases the pus needs to be drained from the abscess.\nThis can be carried out under ultrasound or computerised tomography (CT) guidance using local anaesthetic and a needle inserted through the skin, followed by the\u00a0placement of a drain.\nIf an abscess is found during surgery, the area is carefully washed out and a course of antibiotics is given.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint.\nIn the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people\u00a0of all ages, including children (see below).\nTypes of arthritis\nThe two most common types of arthritis are:\n\nosteoarthritis\nrheumatoid arthritis\n\nOsteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people.\nIt most often develops in\u00a0adults who are in their late 40s or older. It's also more common in women and\u00a0people with a family history of\u00a0the condition.\u00a0However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other\u00a0joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.\nOsteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.\nOnce the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes.\nSevere loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.\nThe most commonly affected joints\u00a0are those in the:\n\nhands\nspine\nknees\nhips\n\nIn the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men.\nRheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.\u00a0\nThe outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This\u00a0may cause the\u00a0bone and cartilage to break down.\nPeople with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.\u00a0\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis \u2013 a long-term inflammatory\u00a0condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together.\u00a0Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints.\nCervical spondylosis \u2013 also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness.\nFibromyalgia \u2013 causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons.\nLupus \u2013 an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues.\nGout \u2013 a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe) but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness\u00a0and swelling.\nPsoriatic arthritis \u2013 an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with\u00a0psoriasis.\nEnteropathic arthritis \u2013 a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the two best-known types being ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. About one in\u00a0five people with Crohn's or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. The most common areas affected by inflammation are\u00a0the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine.\nReactive arthritis \u2013 this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through).\u00a0It develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection.\nSecondary arthritis \u2013 a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica \u2013 a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and\u00a0stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause\u00a0joint inflammation.\n\nSymptoms of arthritis\nThe\u00a0symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have.\nThis is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have:\n\njoint pain, tenderness and stiffness\ninflammation in and around the joints\nrestricted movement of the\u00a0joints\nwarm, red skin over the affected joint\nweakness and\u00a0muscle wasting\n\nArthritis and children\nArthritis is often associated with older people, but\u00a0it can also\u00a0affect children. In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis.\nMost types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and\u00a0inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks.\nAlthough the exact cause of JIA is\u00a0unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life.\nThe main types of JIA are discussed below. Arthritis Research UK has more information about the different types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\nOligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body\u00a0\u2013\u00a0most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists.\nOligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there's a risk that children\u00a0with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular\u00a0eye\u00a0tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended.\nPolyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood.\nThe symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above.\nSystemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can\u00a0become swollen and inflamed.\nLike polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age.\nEnthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone.\nTreating arthritis\nThere's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition.\nFor osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including:\n\npainkillers\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\ncorticosteroids\n\nIn severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended:\n\narthroplasty (joint replacement)\narthodesis (joint fusion)\nosteotomy (where a\u00a0bone is cut and re-aligned)\n\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0how osteoarthritis is treated.\nTreatment for\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis aims\u00a0to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is\u00a0to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include:\n\nanalgesics (painkillers)\ndisease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a combination of treatments is often recommended\nphysiotherapy\u00a0\nregular exercise\u00a0\n\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0how rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0is treated.\n\n\nLiving with arthritis isn't easy and carrying out simple, everyday tasks can often be painful and difficult.\nHowever, there are many things you can do to make sure you live a healthy lifestyle.\u00a0A range of services and benefits are also available.\nWork\nMany people with arthritis want to continue working for many reasons, including better\u00a0financial security and higher self-esteem.\nBetter treatment options have helped to ensure that many people return to work after being diagnosed with arthritis.\u00a0This is particularly the case if arthritis is diagnosed and treated at an early stage.\nYou may find work challenging, but your employer should help you with the training and support you need.\nHelp is also available if your arthritis is so severe that you're unable to work. Find out more about the Personal Independence Payment (formerly known as the Disability Living Allowance).\nHealthy eating\nIt's very important to eat a\u00a0healthy, balanced\u00a0diet if you have arthritis. Eating healthily will give you all the nutrients you need and help you maintain a healthy weight.\nYour diet should consist of a variety of foods from all\u00a05 food\u00a0groups. These are:\n\nfruit and vegetables\nstarchy foods \u2013 like bread, rice, potatoes and pasta\nmeat, fish,\u00a0eggs and beans\nmilk and dairy foods\nfoods containing\u00a0fat and sugar\n\nFurther information\u00a0about how to have a healthy, balanced diet.\nWeight\nIf you're overweight, losing weight can really help you cope with arthritis. Too much weight places excess pressure on the joints in your hips, knees, ankles and feet, leading to increased pain and mobility problems.\nFurther information\u00a0about\u00a0how you can lose weight.\nExercise\nIf your arthritis is painful, you may not feel like exercising. However, being active can help reduce and prevent pain. Regular exercise\u00a0can also:\n\nimprove your range of movement and joint mobility\nincrease muscle strength\nreduce stiffness\nboost your energy\n\nAs long as you do the right type and level of exercise for your condition, your arthritis won't get any worse. Combined with a healthy, balanced diet (see above), regular exercise will\u00a0help you lose weight and place less strain on your joints.\nYour GP can advise about the type and level of exercise that's right for you.\u00a0\nVersus Arthritis also has further information about exercising with arthritis.\u00a0\nJoint care\nIf you have arthritis, it's important to look after your joints so there's no further damage. For example, try to reduce the stress on your joints while carrying out everyday tasks like moving and lifting.\nSome\u00a0tips for protecting your joints,\u00a0particularly if you have arthritis, include:\n\nuse larger, stronger joints as levers\u00a0\u2013 for example,\u00a0take the pressure of opening a heavy door on your shoulder rather than on your hand\nuse several joints to spread the weight of an object\u00a0\u2013 for example, use both hands to carry your shopping or distribute the weight evenly in a shoulder bag or rucksack\ndon't grip too tightly\u00a0\u2013 grip as loosely\u00a0as possible or use a padded handle\u00a0to widen your grip\n\nIt's also important to\u00a0avoid sitting in the same position for long periods of time and to take regular breaks so you can move around.\nAt home\nIf you have arthritis, carrying out tasks around the home can be a challenge. However, making some practical changes to your home and changing the way you work should make things easier.\nPractical tips that could help include:\n\nkeeping things in easy\u00a0reach\nusing a hand rail to help you get up and down the stairs\nusing long-handled tools to pick things up or to clean\nfitting levers to\u00a0taps to make them easier to turn\nusing electric kitchen equipment,\u00a0like tin openers, when preparing food\n\nVersus Arthritis has further information and tips for living with arthritis.\nAn occupational therapist can help if you have severe\u00a0arthritis that's affecting your ability to move around your home and carry out everyday tasks,\u00a0like cooking and cleaning.\nThey can advise about equipment you may need to help you live independently.\nDepending on the exact nature of your condition, your GP may be able to refer you to an NHS occupational therapist.

In the past, it was widely used in construction.\nAsbestos can\u00a0be very dangerous.\u00a0It does not present a health risk if it is undisturbed, but if material containing asbestos\u00a0is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate,\u00a0it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres.\nWhen the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage\u00a0them over time. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary.\u00a0However, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure.\nRead more about the causes of asbestosis.\nSymptoms of asbestosis\nBreathing in asbestos fibres may eventually scar the lungs of some people, which can lead to a number of symptoms, including:\n\nshortness of breath \u2013 this may only occur after physical\u00a0activity at first, but it\u00a0can eventually become a more constant problem\na persistent\u00a0cough\nwheezing\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nchest pain\nin more advanced cases,\u00a0clubbed (swollen) fingertips\n\nNowadays, most people who are diagnosed with asbestosis were exposed many years ago, before there were effective controls on exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace.\nSee your GP if you have the above symptoms and you think you may have been exposed to asbestos in the past.\nRead more about diagnosing asbestosis.\nTreating asbestosis\nThere is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs.\nOne of the\u00a0most important things someone with the condition can do is to\u00a0stop smoking,\u00a0if they smoke. This is because\u00a0the symptoms\u00a0are more\u00a0likely to get worse in people who smoke, and\u00a0smoking also increases the risk of lung cancer\u00a0in people with asbestosis.\nIf necessary, treatments such as oxygen therapy\u00a0can improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis.\nRead more about treating asbestosis.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for asbestosis can vary significantly, depending on the extent of damage to the lungs and whether any other conditions are present.\nAsbestosis can get worse over time and severe cases can place a significant strain on a person's health and shorten their life expectancy,\u00a0but in many cases the condition progresses very slowly or not at all.\nHowever, people with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:\n\npleural disease \u2013 where the membrane covering the lungs (pleura) becomes thicker, which can further contribute to breathlessness and chest discomfort\nmesothelioma \u2013 a type of cancer that affects the membrane that covers the lungs, heart and gut\nlung cancer\n\nOverall, more people with asbestosis die as a result of one of the cancers mentioned above, or from natural causes, than from asbestosis itself.\nCompensation\nIf you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, you may be able to claim compensation. This can be done through:\n\nindustrial injuries disablement benefit \u2013 this is\u00a0a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed)\na civil claim for compensation through the courts \u2013\u00a0you will need to obtain legal advice about how to do this\na claim for a lump compensation sum under the\u00a0Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 \u2013\u00a0if you have asbestosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and\u00a0you haven't been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you (or the person on whose behalf you are claiming) has ceased trading\n\nRead more about industrial injuries disablement benefit on the GOV.UK website.\nPreventing asbestosis\nThere are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. Two of these \u2013 called crocidolite and amosite \u2013 were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999.\nHowever, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings.\nIt's therefore\u00a0important to take precautions to reduce your risk of inhaling asbestos fibres if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos.\nIf you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos,\u00a0you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. Do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself.\nIf your job means\u00a0you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of what you can do to reduce your risk. Do not\u00a0attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely.\nRead about preventing asbestosis.\nWho is affected\nAsbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years.\nHowever, in 2011 there were 178 deaths directly caused by asbestosis and 429 where the condition was thought to have played a role. 980 new cases were assessed for industrial injuries disablement benefit during 2012.\n\n\nAsbestosis is caused by breathing in asbestos fibres. People working in certain trades are more likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the past.\nWhat is asbestos?\nAsbestos is a general term\u00a0for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres.\u00a0Materials containing asbestos used to be widely used in construction, because they are strong, durable and fire-resistant.\nThere were three main types of asbestos in commercial use:\n\ncrocidolite ('blue asbestos')\namosite ('brown asbestos')\nchrysotile ('white asbestos')\n\nAll these types of asbestos are hazardous if a material containing them becomes damaged and the fibres are released into the air.\nNo crocidolite was imported into the UK after 1970, and both amosite and crocidolite were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans on the industrial use of both these materials came into force earlier than this). Chrysotile was not banned until 1999.\nThis means that, although asbestos is no longer used, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.\nHow asbestos fibres affect the lungs\nWhen you inhale a foreign body, such as a dust particle, cells in the lungs called macrophages\u00a0usually hunt and break the particle down before it gets into your lung tissues and bloodstream.\nHowever, asbestos fibres are too difficult for the macrophages to break down. In an attempt to break down the fibres, the macrophages release substances that are intended to destroy the fibres, but actually cause the tiny air sacs in your lungs (alveoli) to become damaged and permanently scarred over time. This scarring is what is known as asbestosis.\nAlveoli are crucial in transferring oxygen from the air into your bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide from your bloodstream. If they become damaged and scarred, these processes will be affected, resulting in symptoms such as breathlessness.\nFor asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure \u2013 usually over many years \u2013 to relatively high numbers of\u00a0asbestosis fibres is necessary.\nOccupations associated with asbestos exposure\nThe use of asbestos increased significantly after World War II. It\u00a0peaked during the 1970s, before declining during the 1980s and 1990s. You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, where asbestos was used during this time period.\nOccupations particularly associated with exposure to asbestos during this period\u00a0include:\n\ninsulation workers\nboilermakers\nplumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters\nshipyard workers\nsheet metal workers\nplasterers\nchemical technicians\u00a0\nheating, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics\n\nNow that asbestos is\u00a0no longer used,\u00a0those most at risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres include people whose jobs put them at risk of damaging any asbestos remaining in older buildings, such as caretakers,\u00a0electricians and demolition workers.\nThe\u00a0Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website has further information about when you are most likely to be at risk of asbestos exposure.\n\n\nWhen diagnosing asbestosis, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs).\nIf your lungs have been affected by asbestos, they will usually make a crackling noise when you breathe in.\nYour GP will also ask about your work history, particularly\u00a0about periods when you may have been exposed to asbestos, how long you may have been exposed, and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working.\nReferral to a specialist\nIf\u00a0asbestosis is\u00a0suspected,\u00a0you\u00a0will be referred to a specialist in lung diseases for tests to confirm any lung scarring. These may include:\u00a0\n\na chest X-ray\u00a0\u2013 to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs that could be caused by asbestosis\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0of the lungs \u2013 which produces more detailed images of\u00a0the lungs and the membrane covering the lungs and can help identify less obvious abnormalities\nlung function tests \u2013 to assess the impact of damage of the lungs, determine how much air your lungs can hold and assess\u00a0how well oxygen crosses the membrane of the lungs into your bloodstream\n\nBefore confirming a diagnosis of asbestosis, the chest specialist will also consider and rule out other possible causes of lung inflammation and scarring, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nThere is no cure for asbestosis, as the damage to the lungs is irreversible. However, you can take steps to reduce your symptoms and improve your quality of life.\nNot smoking\nIf you have been diagnosed with asbestosis and you smoke, it's very important to stop as soon as possible.\nSmoking can make your symptoms of\u00a0breathlessness worse and significantly increase your risk of developing lung cancer\u00a0at a later stage.\nSpeak to your GP for help with giving up smoking. They can advise about nicotine replacement therapies and prescription medicines that\u00a0can greatly increase your chances of quitting successfully. Your GP can also\u00a0put you in touch with local support groups in your area.\nYou can also phone Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0on 0800 84 84 84 to get more help and advice about quitting smoking.\nRead more about\u00a0stopping smoking.\nVaccinations\nIf you have asbestosis, your lungs will be more vulnerable to infection.\nIt's recommended that you have the\u00a0influenza (flu) vaccination to protect against flu, and the pneumococcal vaccination to protect you from the bacteria that can cause serious conditions, such as pneumonia. Your GP\u00a0can arrange for you to have these vaccinations.\nYou will need the flu vaccine every year to ensure you stay protected. Most people only require one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine, although additional booster shots may be recommended if your general health is poor.\nLong-term oxygen therapy\nIf you have severe asbestosis, your body may not be getting all\u00a0the oxygen it needs to function properly.\u00a0Oxygen therapy may be recommended\u00a0if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood.\nOxygen therapy\u00a0is supplied through a machine called an oxygen concentrator, which purifies oxygen from the air in the room and produces a more oxygen-rich supply of air.\nThis oxygen-rich air is breathed in through a mask or a small, soft plastic tube\u00a0placed just inside your nostrils (nasal cannula).\nYou may be given a small, portable oxygen tank and mask, to be used when you're out of the house. This is known as ambulatory oxygen.\nIt's very important not to smoke when you are using an oxygen concentrator. This is because high concentrations of oxygen\u00a0are highly flammable, and a lit cigarette or flame could cause a fire or an explosion.\nMedication\nMost people with asbestosis will not benefit from any specific medication for the condition, unless you have another condition also affecting the lungs,\u00a0such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nMore severe cases may benefit\u00a0from medicines, such as small doses of\u00a0morphine to reduce breathlessness and a\u00a0cough.\nSerious side effects are uncommon, because the dose is so small. The most common problem is constipation,\u00a0and a laxative will usually be given at the same time to help you pass stools.\n\n\nAlthough asbestos is no longer widely used in the UK, it's still important to take precautions to reduce your risk of exposure, because it's still found in many old buildings.\nStrict regulations were introduced in 1970 to regulate the use of asbestos in the workplace.\nHowever, the import, supply and use of brown (amosite) and blue (crocidolite) asbestos was not banned in the UK until 1985. White asbestos (chrysotile) was banned in 1999, except for a small number of specialist uses of the material.\nThis means that buildings that were built or refurbished before the year 2000 could still contain asbestos.\nAsbestos in your home\nIf you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos, you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council.\nIn these circumstances, it may be best to leave any asbestos-containing materials\u00a0where they are \u2013 especially if they are in good condition and unlikely to get damaged. You should check the condition of the materials from time to time to make sure they haven't been damaged or started to deteriorate.\nSlightly damaged asbestos-containing materials can sometimes be repaired by sealing or enclosing them. However, this should only be done by someone with the necessary training. Any badly-damaged asbestos material that cannot be protected should be removed by someone who is appropriately trained. Your local environmental health officer can advise you about this.\nIf you are planning any home improvements, repairs or maintenance, and you intend to bring in any additional workers or contractors, you should inform them of any asbestos materials in your home before they start work. This will help reduce the risks of any\u00a0asbestos-containing material\u00a0being disturbed.\nYou can search for\u00a0who to contact about asbestos in your home on the GOV.UK website.\nAsbestos in your workplace\nIf your job doesn't directly put you at risk of asbestos exposure, but you are concerned about asbestos in your workplace, speak to the building duty holder about what they are doing to monitor and manage the situation.\nA duty holder is someone who is responsible for maintaining and repairing non-domestic premises.\nIf any asbestos-containing materials in your workplace are assessed as being in good condition, and not in a position where they are likely to be damaged, they will usually be left in place and monitored.\nHowever,\u00a0asbestos-containing materials that are in a poor condition or\u00a0are likely to be damaged during the normal use of the building should be sealed, enclosed or removed as appropriate.\nWorking with asbestos\nIf your job means that you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure the appropriate precautions are taken before and during any work you do.\nThe Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has drawn up the following checklist for employers,\u00a0managers and traders to go through before carrying out work on a building that may contain asbestos:\nSteps that may help reduce your exposure to asbestos during your work include wearing protective equipment (such as a suitable face mask),\u00a0cleaning up as you go (using a\u00a0vacuum cleaner or wet rags, rather than sweeping) and not using power tools whenever possible.\nThe HSE website has more information about:\n\nmanaging and working with asbestos\ndos and don'ts when working with asbestos\ntask sheets\u00a0outlining\u00a0how to carry out non-licensed work with asbestos\n\nYou may also find it useful to read the\u00a0Control of Asbestos Regulations (2012), which outline the measures that should be in place to reduce the risk of asbestos exposure.\nRead the full\u00a0Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 (PDF, 143 KB).\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness.\nThe severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems.\nOccasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an 'asthma attack', although doctors sometimes use the term 'exacerbation'.\nSevere\u00a0attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual.\nRead more about the symptoms of asthma\u00a0and diagnosing asthma\nWhat causes asthma?\nAsthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal.\nWhen you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs \u2013 known as a trigger \u2013 your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).\nCommon asthma triggers include:\n\nhouse dust mites\nanimal fur\npollen\ncigarette\u00a0smoke\nexercise\nviral infections\n\nAsthma may also be triggered by substances (allergens or chemicals) inhaled while at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday.\nThe reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition.\nAsthma can develop at any age,\u00a0including in young children and elderly people.\nRead more about the causes of asthma\nWho is affected?\nIn the UK, around 5.4 million people are currently receiving treatment for asthma.\nThat's the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and\u00a01 in every 11 children. Asthma in adults is more common in women than men.\nHow\u00a0asthma is treated\nWhile there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition.\nTreatment is based on two important goals, which are:\n\nrelieving symptoms\u00a0\npreventing future symptoms and attacks\n\nFor most people, this will involve the occasional \u2013 or, more commonly, daily \u2013 use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. However, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important.\nYou should have a personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse that includes information about the medicines you need to take, how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse, and what steps to take when they do so.\nRead more about treating asthma\u00a0and\u00a0living with asthma\nOutlook\nFor many people, asthma is a long-term condition \u2013 particularly if it first develops in adulthood.\nAsthma symptoms are usually controllable and reversible with treatment, although some people with\u00a0long-lasting asthma may\u00a0develop permanent narrowing of their airways and more persistent problems. \u00a0\nFor children diagnosed with asthma, the condition may disappear or improve during the teenage years, although it can return later in life. Moderate or severe childhood asthma is more likely to persist or return later on.\n\n\nThe symptoms of asthma can range from mild to severe. Most people will only experience occasional symptoms, although a few people will have problems most of the time.\nThe main symptoms of asthma are:\n\nwheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe)\nshortness of breath\na tight chest \u2013 which may feel like\u00a0a band is tightening around\u00a0it\u00a0\ncoughing\n\nThese symptoms are often worse at night and early in the morning, particularly if the condition is not well controlled. They may also develop or become worse in response to a certain trigger, such as exercise or exposure to an allergen.\nRead our page on the\u00a0causes of asthma for more information about potential triggers.\nSpeak to your GP if you think you or your child may have asthma. You should also talk to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have been diagnosed with asthma and you are finding it difficult to control the symptoms.\nAsthma attacks\nWhen asthma symptoms get significantly worse, it is known as an asthma attack or 'acute asthma exacerbation'.\nAsthma attacks often develop slowly, sometimes taking a couple of days or more to become serious, although some people with asthma are prone to sudden, unexpected severe attacks. It is important to recognise attacks early and take appropriate action.\nDuring an asthma attack, the symptoms described above may get worse and \u2013 if you're already on treatment \u2013 your inhaler medication may not work\u00a0as well as it normally does.\nYou might be monitoring your asthma using a device called a peak flow meter, and there\u00a0may be a drop in your peak expiratory flow. Read about diagnosing asthma for more information.\nSigns of a particularly severe asthma attack can include:\n\nyour reliever inhaler (which is usually blue) is not helping symptoms as much as usual, or at all\nwheezing, coughing and chest tightness becoming severe and constant\nbeing too breathless to eat, speak or sleep\nbreathing faster\na rapid heartbeat\nfeeling drowsy, exhausted or dizzy\nyour lips or fingers\u00a0turning blue (cyanosis)\n\nPhone 999 to seek immediate help if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe asthma attack.\n\n\nIt's not clear exactly what causes asthma, although it is likely to be a combination of factors.\nSome of these may be genetic. However, a number of environmental factors are thought to\u00a0play a role in the development of asthma. These include air pollution, chlorine in swimming pools and modern hygiene standards (known as the 'hygiene hypothesis').\nThere is currently not enough evidence to be certain whether any of these can cause asthma, although a variety of environmental irritants, such as dust, cold air and smoke, may make it worse.\nWho is at risk?\nAlthough the cause of asthma is unknown, a number of things that can increase your chances of developing the condition have been identified. These include:\n\na family history of asthma or other related allergic conditions (known as atopic conditions) such as eczema,\u00a0food allergy or hay fever\nhaving\u00a0another atopic condition\nhaving bronchiolitis (a common childhood lung infection) as a child\nchildhood exposure to tobacco smoke, particularly if your mother also smoked during pregnancy\u00a0\nbeing born prematurely, especially if you needed a ventilator to support your breathing after birth\nhaving a low birth weight as a result of restricted growth within the womb\n\nSome people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job.\nAsthma triggers\nIn people with asthma, the small tubes (bronchi) that carry air in and out of the lungs become inflamed and more sensitive than normal.\nThis means that when you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs (a trigger), your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm).\nAsthma symptoms can have a range of triggers, such as:\n\nrespiratory tract infections \u2013 particularly infections affecting the upper airways, such as\u00a0colds and the flu\nallergens \u2013 including pollen, dust mites, animal fur or feathers\nairborne irritants \u2013 including cigarette smoke, chemical fumes and atmospheric pollution\nmedicines \u2013 particularly the class of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which includes aspirin and ibuprofen, and\u00a0beta-blockers sometimes given for\u00a0high blood pressure or some types of\u00a0heart disease\nemotions \u2013 including stress or laughing\nfoods containing sulphites \u2013 naturally occurring substances found in some food and drinks, such as concentrated fruit juice, jam, prawns and many processed or pre-cooked meals\nweather conditions \u2013 including\u00a0a sudden change in temperature, cold air, windy days, thunderstorms, poor air quality and hot, humid days\nindoor conditions \u2013 including mould or damp, house dust mites and chemicals in carpets and flooring materials\nexercise\nfood allergies \u2013 including allergies to nuts or other food items\n\nOnce you know your asthma triggers, you\u00a0may be able to\u00a0help control your condition by trying\u00a0to avoid them.\n\nAsthma UK: asthma triggers A-Z\n\nOccupational asthma\nIn some cases, asthma is\u00a0associated with substances\u00a0you may be exposed to\u00a0at work. This is known as \"occupational asthma\".\nSome of the most commonly reported\u00a0causes of occupational asthma include exposure to:\n\nisocyanates (chemicals often found in spray paint)\nflour and grain dust\ncolophony (a substance\u00a0often found in solder fumes)\nlatex\nanimals\nwood dust\n\nYou may be at an increased risk of developing occupational asthma if you are regularly exposed to substances such as these through\u00a0your work.\nOccupations that are commonly associated with the condition include paint sprayers, bakers and pastry makers, nurses, chemical workers, animal handlers, welders, food processing workers and timber workers.\n\nAsthma UK:\u00a0occupational asthma\nHealth and Safety Executive: asthma\n\n\n\nIf you have typical asthma symptoms, your GP will often be able to make a diagnosis.\nThey\u00a0will want to know when\u00a0the symptoms happen and how often, and if you have noticed anything that might trigger them.\nYour GP may also ask whether\u00a0you have any allergic (atopic) conditions such as\u00a0eczema and\u00a0hay fever, which often occur alongside asthma.\nA number of tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. These are described below.\nIn children, asthma can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions can cause similar symptoms in infants. The tests outlined below are also not always suitable for\u00a0children.\nYour GP therefore may sometimes suggest\u00a0that your child uses\u00a0an asthma inhaler as a trial treatment. If this helps improve your child's symptoms, it is likely\u00a0they have asthma.\nSpirometry\nA breathing test called\u00a0spirometry will often be carried out to assess how well your lungs work. This involves taking a deep breath and exhaling as fast as you can through a mouthpiece attached to a machine called a spirometer.\nThe spirometer takes two measurements \u2013 the volume of air you can breathe out in the first second of exhalation (the forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1) and the total amount of air you breathe out (the forced vital capacity or FVC).\nYou may be asked to breathe into the spirometer a few times to get an accurate reading.\nThe readings are then compared with average measurements for people your age, sex and height, which can show if your airways are obstructed.\nSometimes an initial set of measurements is taken, and you are\u00a0then given a medicine to open up your airways (a reliever inhaler) to see if this improves your breathing when another reading is taken.\nThis is known as reversibility testing, and it can be useful in distinguishing asthma from other lung conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nPeak expiratory flow test\nA small hand-held device known as a peak flow meter can be used to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs in one breath. This is your peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the test is usually called a peak flow test.\nThis test requires a bit of practise to get it right, so your GP or nurse will show you how to do it and may suggest you take the best of two or three readings.\nYou may be given a peak flow meter to take home and a diary to record measurements of your peak flow over a period of weeks. This is because asthma is variable and your lung function may change throughout the day.\nYour diary may also have a space to record your symptoms. This helps to diagnose asthma and, once diagnosed, will help you recognise when your asthma is getting worse and aid decisions about what action to take.\nTo help diagnose asthma that may be related to your work (occupational asthma), your GP may ask you to take measurements of your peak expiratory flow both at work and when you are away from work. Your GP may then refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis.\nOther tests\nSome people may also need a\u00a0number of more specialised tests. The tests may confirm the diagnosis of asthma or help diagnose a different condition. This will help you and your doctor to plan your treatment.\nThis test is sometimes used to diagnose asthma when the diagnosis is not clear from the more simple tests discussed above. It measures how your airways react when they come into contact with a trigger.\nYou will be asked to breathe in a medication that deliberately irritates or constricts your airways slightly if you have asthma, causing a small decrease in your FEV1 measured using spirometry and possibly triggering mild asthma symptoms. If you do not have asthma, your airways will not respond to this stimulus.\nThe test often involves inhaling progressively increasing amounts of the medication at intervals, with spirometry measurement of FEV1 in between to see if it falls below a certain threshold. In some cases, however, exercise may be used as a trigger.\nIt may also be useful in some cases to carry out tests to check for inflammation in your airways. This can be done in two main ways:\n\na\u00a0mucus sample \u2013 the doctor may take a sample of mucus (phlegm)\u00a0so it can be tested for signs of\u00a0inflammation in the airways\nnitric oxide concentration \u2013 as you breathe out, the level of nitric oxide in your breath is measured using a special machine;\u00a0a high level of nitric oxide can be a sign of airway inflammation\n\nSkin testing or a blood test can be used to confirm whether your asthma is associated with specific allergies,\u00a0such as\u00a0dust mites, pollen or foods.\nTests can also be carried out to see if you are allergic or sensitive to certain substances known to cause occupational asthma.\nRead more about diagnosing allergies\n\n\nReliever inhalers\nReliever inhalers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0usually blue\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are taken to relieve asthma symptoms quickly.\nThe inhaler usually contains a medicine called a short-acting beta2-agonist, which works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. This allows the airways to open wider, making it easier to breathe again.\nReliever inhalers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways, so they do not make asthma better in the long term \u2013 they are intended only for the relief of symptoms.\nExamples of reliever medicines include salbutamol and terbutaline. They are generally safe medicines with few side effects, unless overused.\nHowever, they should rarely, if ever, be necessary if asthma is well controlled, and anyone needing to use them three or more times a week should have their treatment reviewed.\nEveryone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler, also known simply as a 'reliever'.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK: relievers\n\nPreventer inhalers\nPreventer inhalers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0usually brown, red or orange\u00a0\u2013\u00a0work over time to reduce the amount of inflammation and sensitivity of the airways, and reduce the chances of asthma attacks occurring.\nThey must be used regularly (typically twice or occasionally once daily) and indefinitely to keep asthma under control.\nYou will need to use the preventer inhaler daily for some time before you gain the full benefit. You may still occasionally need the blue reliever inhaler to relieve your\u00a0symptoms, but your treatment should be reviewed\u00a0if you continue to need them often.\nThe preventer inhaler usually contains a medicine called an inhaled corticosteroid. Examples of preventer medicines include beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide and mometasone.\nPreventer treatment should be taken regularly if you have anything more than occasional symptoms from your asthma, and certainly if you feel the need to use a reliever inhaler more than twice a week.\nSome inhaled corticosteroids can occasionally cause a mild fungal infection (oral thrush) in the mouth and throat, so make sure you rinse your mouth thoroughly after inhaling a dose. The use of a spacer device also reduces this risk.\nSmoking can reduce the effects of preventer inhalers.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK:\u00a0preventer inhalers\n\nOther treatments and 'add-on' therapy\nIf your asthma does not respond to initial treatment, the dose of preventer inhaler you take may be increased in agreement with your healthcare team.\nIf this does not control your asthma symptoms, you may be given an inhaler containing a medicine called a long-acting reliever (long-acting bronchodilator/long-acting beta2-agonist, or LABA) to take as well.\nThese work in the same way as short-acting relievers. Although they take slightly longer to work, their effects can last for up to 12 hours. This means that taking them regularly twice a day provides 24-hour cover.\nRegular use of long-acting relievers can also help reduce the dosage of preventer medication needed to control asthma. Examples of long-acting relievers include formoterol and salmeterol, and recently vilanterol, which may last up to 24 hours.\nHowever, like short-acting relievers, long-acting relievers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways. If they are taken without a preventer, this may allow the condition to get worse while masking the symptoms, increasing the chance of a sudden and potentially life-threatening severe asthma attack.\nYou should therefore always use a long-acting reliever inhaler in combination with a preventer inhaler, and never by itself.\nIn view of this, most long-acting relievers are prescribed in a 'combination' inhaler, which contains both an inhaled steroid (as a preventer) and a long-acting bronchodilator in the one device.\nExamples of combination inhalers include Seretide, Symbicort, Fostair, Flutiform and Relvar. These are usually (but not always) purple, red and white, or maroon.\nIf regular efficient administration of treatment with a preventer and a long-acting reliever still fails to control asthma symptoms, additional medicines may be tried. Two possible alternatives include:\n\nleukotriene receptor antagonists \u2013\u00a0tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways\ntheophyllines \u2013\u00a0tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agents\n\nIf your asthma is still not under control, you may be prescribed regular steroid tablets. This treatment is usually monitored by a respiratory specialist (an asthma specialist).\nOral steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory preventers, which are generally used in two ways:\n\nto regain control of asthma when it is temporarily upset\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, by a lapse in regular medication or an unexpected chest infection; in these cases, they are typically given for one or two weeks, then stopped\nwhen long-term control of asthma remains a problem, despite maximal dosages of inhaled and other medications\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in these cases, oral steroids may be given for prolonged periods, or even indefinitely, while maintaining maximum treatment with inhalers as\u00a0this maximises the chance of being able to stop the oral steroids again in the future\n\nLong-term use of oral steroids has serious possible\u00a0side effects, so they are only used once other treatment options have been tried, and after discussing the risks and benefits with your healthcare team.\nOmalizumab, also known as Xolair, is the first of a new category of medication that binds to one of the proteins involved in the immune response and reduces its level in the blood. This lowers the chance of an immune reaction happening and causing an asthma attack.\nIt is licensed for use in adults and children over six years of age with asthma.\nThe National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that omalizumab can be used in people with allergy-related asthma who\u00a0need continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids.\nOmalizumab is given as an injection every two to four weeks. It should only be prescribed in a specialist centre. If omalizumab does not control asthma symptoms within 16 weeks, the treatment should be stopped.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK:\u00a0other treatments and 'add-on' therapies\nAsthma UK:\u00a0steroid tablets\nNICE: omalizumab for severe persistent allergic asthma\n\nBronchial thermoplasty is a relatively new procedure\u00a0that can be used\u00a0in some cases of severe asthma. It works\u00a0by destroying some of the muscles surrounding the airways in the lungs, which can\u00a0reduce their ability to narrow the airways.\nThe procedure is carried out either with sedation or under general anaesthetic. A bronchoscope (a long, flexible tube) containing a probe is inserted into the lungs through the mouth or nose\u00a0so it touches the airways.\nThe probe then uses controlled heat to damage the muscles around the airways. Three treatment sessions are usually needed, with at least\u00a0three weeks between each session.\nThere is some evidence to show\u00a0this procedure may reduce asthma attacks and improve the quality of life of someone with severe asthma.\nHowever, the long-term risks and benefits are not yet fully understood. There is a small risk it will trigger an asthma attack, which sometimes requires hospital admission.\nYou should discuss this procedure fully with your clinician if the treatment is offered.\nRead further information:\n\nNICE:\u00a0bronchial thermoplasty for severe asthma\n\nSide effects of treatments\nRelievers are a safe and effective medicine, and have\u00a0few side effects as long as they are not used too much. The main side effects include a mild shaking of the hands (tremors),\u00a0headaches and muscle cramps. These usually only happen with high doses of reliever inhaler and usually only last for a few minutes.\nPreventers are\u00a0very safe at usual doses, although they can cause a range of side effects at high doses, especially with long-term use.\nThe main side effect of preventer inhalers is a fungal infection of the mouth or throat (oral candidiasis). You may also develop a hoarse voice and sore throat.\nUsing a spacer can help prevent these side effects, as can rinsing your mouth or cleaning your teeth after\u00a0using\u00a0your preventer inhaler.\nYour doctor or nurse will discuss with you the need to balance control of your asthma with the risk of side effects, and how to keep\u00a0side effects to a minimum.\nLong-acting relievers may cause similar side effects to short-acting relievers. You should be monitored at the beginning of your treatment and reviewed regularly. If you find there is no benefit to using the long-acting reliever, it should be stopped.\nTheophylline tablets have been known to cause side effects in some people, including nausea, vomiting, tremors and noticeable heartbeats (palpitations). These can usually be avoided by adjusting the dose according to periodic measurement of the theophylline concentration in the blood.\nSide effects of leukotriene receptor agonists can include tummy (abdominal) pain and headaches.\nOral steroids carry a risk if they are taken for more than three months or if they are taken frequently (more than three or four courses of steroids a year). Side effects can include:\n\nosteoporosis (fragile bones) \u00a0\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\u00a0\ndiabetes\u00a0\nincreased appetite, leading to weight gain\ncataracts and\u00a0glaucoma (eye disorders)\u00a0\u00a0\nthinning of the skin \u00a0\neasy bruising \u00a0\nmuscle weakness\n\nWith the exception of increased appetite, which is very commonly experienced by people taking oral steroids, most of these unwanted effects are uncommon.\nHowever, it is a good idea to keep an eye out for them regularly, especially side effects that are not immediately obvious, such as high blood pressure, thinning of the bones, diabetes and glaucoma.\nYou will need regular appointments to check for these.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK:\u00a0side effects of asthma medicines\n\nAsthma attacks\nA\u00a0personal asthma action plan will help you recognise the initial symptoms of an asthma attack, know how to respond, and when to seek medical attention.\nIn most cases, the following actions will be recommended:\nIf your symptoms improve and you do not need to phone 999, you still need to see a doctor or asthma nurse within 24 hours.\nIf you are admitted to hospital, you will be given a combination of oxygen, reliever and preventer medicines to bring your asthma under control.\nYour personal asthma action plan will need to be reviewed after an asthma attack, so reasons for the attack can be identified and avoided in future.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK: what to do in an asthma attack\n\nPersonal asthma action plan\nAs part of your initial assessment, you should be encouraged to draw up a personal asthma action plan with your GP or asthma nurse.\nIf you've been admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack, you should be offered an action plan (or the opportunity to review an existing action plan) before you go home.\nThe action plan should include information about your asthma medicines, and will help you recognise when your symptoms are getting worse and what steps to take. You should also be given information about what to do if you have an asthma attack.\nYour personal asthma action plan should be reviewed with your GP or asthma nurse at least once a year, or more frequently if your symptoms are severe.\nAs part of your asthma plan, you may be given a peak flow meter. This will give you another way of monitoring your asthma, rather than relying only on symptoms, so you can recognise deterioration earlier and take appropriate steps.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK: personal asthma action plan\n\nWhat is good asthma care?\nYour doctor or nurse will tailor your asthma treatment to your symptoms. Sometimes you may need to be on higher levels of medication than at others.\nYou should be offered:\n\ncare at your GP surgery provided by doctors and nurses trained in asthma management\nfull information about your condition and how to control it\ninvolvement in making decisions about your treatment\nregular checks to ensure your asthma is under control and your treatment is right for you (this should be at least once a year)\na written personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse\n\nIt is also important that your GP or pharmacist teaches you how to properly use your inhaler, as this is an important part of good asthma care.\nOccupational asthma\nIf it is possible you have asthma associated with your job (occupational asthma), you will be referred to a respiratory specialist to confirm the diagnosis.\nIf your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer.\nYour employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma. It may\u00a0sometimes be possible to substitute or remove the substance triggering your occupational asthma from your workplace, to redeploy you\u00a0to another role within the company, or to wear protective breathing equipment.\nHowever, you may need to consider changing your job or relocating away from your work environment, ideally within 12 months of your symptoms developing.\nSome people with occupational asthma may be entitled to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK: occupational asthma\nGOV.UK: Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit\nHealth and Safety Executive: asthma\n\nComplementary therapies\nA number of complementary therapies have been suggested for the treatment of asthma, including:\n\nbreathing exercises\ntraditional Chinese herbal medicine\nacupuncture\nionisers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0devices that use an electric current to charge (ionise) molecules of air\nmanual therapies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as chiropractic\nhypnosis\nhomoeopathy\ndietary supplements\n\nHowever, there is little evidence that any of these treatments, other than breathing exercises, are effective.\nThere is some evidence that breathing exercises\u00a0can improve symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medicines in some people. These include\u00a0breathing exercises taught by a physiotherapist, yoga and the Buteyko method (a technique involving slowed, controlled breathing).\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK: complementary therapies\n\n\n\nWith the right treatment and management, asthma shouldn't restrict your daily life (including your sleep) in any way. You should work with your healthcare professionals and strive to achieve this goal.\nYou should also be confident about how to recognise when your asthma is getting out of control, and what to do if it does.\nSleeping\nAsthma symptoms are often worse at night. This means you might wake up some nights coughing or with a tight chest.\nIf your child has asthma, poor sleep can affect their behaviour and concentration, as well as their ability to learn.\nEffectively controlling asthma with the treatment your doctor or nurse recommends will reduce the symptoms, so you or your child\u00a0should sleep better.\nRead about living with insomnia\u00a0for more tips on getting better sleep.\nExercise\nVery occasionally, people with asthma develop symptoms only during exercise. However, usually this is a sign that your asthma could be better controlled generally.\nIf you or your child have asthma symptoms during or after exercise, speak to your doctor or asthma nurse. It is likely they will review your general symptoms and personal asthma plan to make sure\u00a0the condition\u00a0is under control.\nYour doctor or asthma nurse may also advise that:\n\nyou make sure the people you are exercising with know you have asthma\nyou increase your fitness levels gradually\nyou always have your reliever inhaler (usually blue) with you when you exercise\nyou use your reliever inhaler immediately before you warm up\nyou ensure that you always warm up and down thoroughly\nif you have symptoms while you are exercising, stop what you're doing, take your reliever inhaler and wait until you feel better before starting again\n\nRead about health and fitness for more information on simple ways to exercise.\nDiet\nMost people with asthma can eat a normal, healthy diet. Occasionally, people with asthma may have food-based allergic triggers and will need to avoid foods such as cows' milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, yeast products, nuts, and some food colourings and preservatives. However, this is uncommon.\nRead more about eating well\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK: exercise\nAsthma UK: diet and food\n\nKnow your triggers\nIt's important to identify possible asthma triggers by making a note of any worsening symptoms or by using your\u00a0peak flow meter during exposure to certain situations.\nRead our page on the\u00a0causes of asthma for more information about potential triggers.\u00a0\nSome triggers, such as air pollution, illnesses and certain weather conditions, can be hard to avoid. However, it may be possible to avoid other triggers, such as dust mites, fungal spores, pet fur and certain medications that trigger your symptoms.\nMake sure your healthcare team knows about and investigates triggers for your symptoms that you may have noticed yourself.\nRead further information:\n\nAllergy prevention\nAsthma UK: asthma triggers A-Z\n\nComplications of asthma\nQuality of life\nBadly controlled asthma can have an adverse effect on your quality of life. The condition can result in:\n\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nunderperformance or absence from work or school\npsychological problems \u2013 including stress, anxiety and depression\ndisruption of your work and leisure because of unexpected visits to your GP or hospital\nin children, delays in growth or puberty\n\nChildren may also feel excluded from their school friends if they cannot take part in games, sports and social activities.\nRespiratory complications\nIn rare cases, asthma can lead to a number of serious respiratory complications, including:\n\npneumonia\nthe\u00a0collapse of part or all of the lung\nrespiratory failure \u2013 where levels of oxygen in the blood become dangerously low, or levels of carbon dioxide become dangerously high\nstatus asthmaticus (severe asthma attacks that do not respond to normal treatment)\n\nAll these complications are life threatening and will need medical treatment.\nDeath\nAlthough most people are able to effectively control their symptoms, asthma can be a life-threatening condition.\nOften, people who die from asthma do so at home because they do not recognise when their condition is getting worse or leave it too long to take action.\nDo not let this happen to you. Be confident in recognising deterioration of your asthma and what action to take. Take action promptly \u2013 never ignore severe asthma.\nAsthma and pregnancy\nAs a result of\u00a0changes that take place in the body during pregnancy, many women find their asthma symptoms change when they are pregnant. Some women find their asthma improves during pregnancy, while others see it\u00a0worsen. For others, it stays the same.\nThe most severe asthma symptoms experienced by pregnant women tend to occur between the 24th and 36th week of pregnancy. Symptoms then decrease significantly during the last month of pregnancy.\nOnly 10% of women experience asthma symptoms during labour and delivery, and these symptoms can normally be controlled through the use of reliever medicine.\nIt's important to ensure your\u00a0condition is well controlled during pregnancy, because poorly controlled asthma can lead to complications such as pre-eclampsia,\u00a0premature birth and restricted growth of the baby in the womb. Good asthma control also minimises the chance of problems during labour and delivery.\nYou should manage your asthma in the same way you did before you were pregnant. The medicines used for asthma \u2013\u00a0particularly those that are inhaled\u00a0\u2013 are generally considered to be safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding your child.\nThe one exception is leukotriene receptor antagonists. These are not known to be harmful, but there is insufficient experience of their use in pregnancy to be absolutely certain.\nIf, however, you do need to take leukotriene receptor antagonists to control your asthma, you may decide (in discussion with your GP or asthma clinic and obstetrician) that you should carry on taking them and\u00a0that the potential risks to you and your child from uncontrolled asthma are likely to be far higher than any potential risk from this medicine.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK:\u00a0pregnancy\n\nAsthma at school\nMost children with well-controlled asthma can learn and participate in school activities completely unaffected by their condition.\nHowever, it is important to ensure the school has up-to-date written information about your child's asthma medicines, how much they take, and when they need to take them.\nYou may also need to supply the school with a spare reliever inhaler for your child to use if they experience symptoms during the school day.\nStaff at the school should be able to recognise worsening asthma symptoms and know what to do in the event of an attack, particularly staff supervising sport or physical education.\nYour child's school should have an asthma policy in place, which you can ask to see.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK: your child at school\n\nFinancial support\nDepending on how severely asthma affects you on a daily basis, you may be entitled to some benefits, such as:\n\nEmployment and Support Allowance (ESA) \u2013 a benefit paid to people who are not able to work\u00a0because of\u00a0ill health or disability\nAttendance Allowance \u2013 a benefit for help with the extra costs you may have if you're 65 or over and have a physical or mental disability, and need someone to help look after you\n\nRead further information:\n\nGOV.UK: benefits\nAsthma UK: financial help\n\nOccupational asthma\nIf you develop asthma because of your work, and this is fully documented by your doctor and your employer, you can make a claim for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit from the Benefits Agency.\nThis is a weekly amount paid to people with asthma caused by exposure to a specific substance through their work and is known to be associated with asthma (a complete list is available from the Health and Safety Executive).\nIf you want to take legal action against your employer because of occupational asthma, your lawyer must act within three years of diagnosis.\nRead further information:\n\nAsthma UK: occupational asthma\nGOV.UK: Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit\nMoney Advice Service\n\nGet in touch with others\nMany people with a long-term health condition experience feelings of stress, anxiety and depression.\nYou may find it helpful to talk about your experience of asthma with others in a similar position. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others who have been diagnosed with asthma and have undergone treatment.\nIf you experience feelings of depression, talk to your GP. They will be able to give advice and support. Alternatively, find depression support services in your area.\nChat about asthma online at Asthma UK's forum\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Atopic eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common form of eczema. It mainly affects children, but can also affect adults.\nEczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. It is a long-term (chronic) condition in most people, although it can improve over time, especially in children.\nAtopic eczema\u00a0can affect any part of the body,\u00a0but the most common areas to be affected are:\n\nbacks or fronts of\u00a0the knees\noutside or inside of the elbows\naround the neck\nhands\ncheeks\nscalp\n\nPeople with atopic eczema usually\u00a0have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of atopic eczema\u00a0and\u00a0diagnosing atopic eczema.\nWhat causes atopic eczema?\nThe exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it's not down to one single thing. It often occurs in people who get\u00a0allergies\u00a0\u2013 \"atopic\" means sensitivity to allergens.\nIt\u00a0can run in families, and often\u00a0develops alongside other conditions, such as\u00a0asthma\u00a0and\u00a0hay fever.\nThe symptoms of atopic eczema\u00a0often have certain\u00a0triggers, such as\u00a0soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.\u00a0Sometimes\u00a0food allergies\u00a0can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.\nRead\u00a0more about the\u00a0causes of atopic eczema.\nTreating atopic eczema\u00a0\nThere is currently no cure for atopic eczema, but treatment can\u00a0help relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time.\nHowever, severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life and may be difficult to\u00a0cope with physically and mentally. There is also an increased risk of skin infections.\u00a0\nMany different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:\n\nself care techniques,\u00a0such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers\nemollients\u00a0(moisturising treatments)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0used on a daily basis for dry skin\u00a0\ntopical corticosteroids\u2013\u00a0used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups\n\nWhen to get professional advice\nIf you have atopic eczema or symptoms of atopic eczema you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory.\nAtopic eczema isn't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.\nRead more about\u00a0treating\u00a0atopic eczema\u00a0and the\u00a0complications of atopic eczema.\nWho is affected?\nAbout 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0children in the UK has atopic eczema. In 8 out of 10 cases, the condition develops before a child reaches the age of 5. Many children develop it before their first birthday.\nAtopic eczema can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. About half of all cases improve a lot by the time a child reaches 11 years, and around two-thirds improve\u00a0by the age of 16.\nHowever, the condition can continue into adulthood and can sometimes develop for the first time in adults.\n\n\nAtopic eczema causes areas of skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red.\nThere will usually be periods where the symptoms improve, followed by periods where they get worse (flare-ups). Flare-ups may occur as often as 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0times a month.\nAtopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. The face is more commonly involved in adults.\nThe severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching.\nScratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.\nAreas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin. It's not\u00a0a result of\u00a0scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a \"footprint\" of old inflammation\u00a0and will eventually return to its normal colour.\nSigns of an infection\nOccasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include:\n\nyour eczema getting a lot worse\nfluid oozing from the skin\na yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema\nthe skin becoming swollen and sore\na high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell\n\nSee your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child's skin may have become infected.\nRead more about infections and other\u00a0complications of atopic eczema.\n\n\nAtopic eczema is likely to be caused by a combination of things.\nPeople with atopic eczema often have very dry skin because their skin is unable to retain\u00a0much moisture.\nThis dryness may make\u00a0the skin more likely to react to certain triggers, causing it to become red and itchy.\nYou may be born with an increased likelihood of developing atopic eczema because of the genes you inherit from your parents.\nResearch has shown children who have 1\u00a0or both parents with atopic eczema, or who have other siblings with eczema, are more likely to develop it themselves.\nAtopic eczema is not infectious, so it cannot be passed on through close contact.\nEczema triggers\nThere are a number of things that may trigger your eczema symptoms. These can vary from person to person.\nCommon\u00a0triggers include:\n\nirritants \u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0soaps and detergents, including shampoo, washing up liquid\u00a0and bubble bath\nenvironmental factors or\u00a0allergens\u2013 such as cold and dry weather, dampness, and more specific things such as house dust mites, pet fur, pollen and moulds\nfood allergies\u2013 such as allergies to\u00a0cows' milk, eggs, peanuts, soya or wheat\ncertain\u00a0materials worn next to the skin \u2013 such as wool and synthetic fabrics\nhormonal changes \u2013 women may find their symptoms get worse in the days before their period or during pregnancy\nskin infections\n\nSome people also report their symptoms get worse when the air is dry or dusty, or when they are stressed,\u00a0sweaty, or too hot or too cold.\nIf you are diagnosed with atopic eczema, your pharmacist or GP will work with you to try to identify any triggers for your symptoms. Read more about\u00a0diagnosing atopic eczema.\n\n\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions about your symptoms.\nThese questions may include asking:\n\nwhether the rash is itchy and where it appears\nwhen the symptoms first began\nwhether it comes and goes over time\nwhether there is a history of atopic eczema in your family\nwhether you have any other conditions, such as\u00a0allergies\u00a0or\u00a0asthma\n\nYou should tell your pharmacist or GP if your condition is affecting your quality of life\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you\u00a0have difficulty sleeping because of itching, or\u00a0your eczema limits your everyday\u00a0activities.\nChecklist for diagnosing atopic eczema\nTypically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3\u00a0or more of the following:\n\nvisibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin, such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional\na history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above\ngenerally dry skin in the last 12 months\na history of asthma or\u00a0hay fever\u2013 children under 4\u00a0must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions\nthe condition started before the age of 2\u00a0(this does not apply to children under the age of 4)\n\nEstablishing triggers\nYour pharmacist should work with you to establish if any triggers make your eczema worse.\u00a0\nYou may be asked about your diet and lifestyle to see if something obvious may be contributing to your symptoms. For example, you may have noticed some soaps or shampoos make the eczema worse.\nYou may also be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse.\nA food diary involves writing down everything you eat and making a record of any eczema flare-ups you have. Your pharmacist can then use the diary to see if there is a pattern between your symptoms and what you eat.\nAllergy tests\u00a0are not usually needed to identify triggers, although they are sometimes helpful in identifying food allergies that may be triggering symptoms in young children or in those where a food allergy is suspected.\nRead more about\u00a0triggers and causes of atopic eczema.\n\n\nThere is no cure for atopic eczema, but treatments can ease the symptoms. Many children find their symptoms naturally improve as they get older.\nThe main treatments for atopic eczema are:\n\nemollients\u00a0(moisturisers) \u2013 used every day to stop the skin becoming dry\ntopical corticosteroids\u2013\u00a0creams and ointments used to reduce swelling and redness during flare-ups\n\nOther treatments include topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus for eczema in sensitive sites not responding to simpler treatment,\u00a0antihistamines for severe itching, bandages or special body suits to allow the body to heal underneath, or more powerful treatments offered by a dermatologist (skin specialist).\nThe various treatments for\u00a0atopic eczema are outlined below.\u00a0\nSelf care\nAs well as the treatments mentioned above, there are things\u00a0you can\u00a0do yourself to help ease\u00a0your symptoms and prevent further problems.\u00a0\nEczema is often itchy and it can be very tempting to scratch the affected areas of skin. But scratching usually damages the skin, which can itself cause more eczema to occur.\nThe skin eventually thickens into leathery areas as a result of chronic scratching. Deep scratching also causes bleeding and increases the risk of your skin becoming infected or scarred.\nTry to reduce scratching whenever possible. You could try gently rubbing your skin with your fingers instead. If your baby has atopic eczema, anti-scratch mittens may stop them scratching their skin.\nKeep your nails short and clean to minimise damage to the skin from unintentional scratching. Keep your skin covered with light clothing to reduce damage from habitual scratching.\nYour pharmacist will work with you to\u00a0establish what might\u00a0trigger the eczema flare-ups, although\u00a0it may get better or worse for no obvious reason.\nOnce you know\u00a0your triggers, you can try to avoid them.\u00a0For example:\n\nif certain fabrics irritate your skin, avoid wearing these and stick to soft, fine-weave clothing or natural materials such as cotton\nif heat aggravates your eczema, keep the rooms in your home cool, especially the bedroom\navoid using soaps or detergents that may affect your skin\u00a0\u2013 use soap substitutes instead\n\nAlthough\u00a0some people with eczema are allergic to house dust mites, trying to rid your home of them isn't recommended\u00a0as it can be difficult and there is no clear evidence that it helps.\nRead more about\u00a0preventing allergies.\nSome foods, such as eggs and cows' milk, can trigger eczema symptoms. However, you should not make significant changes to your diet without first speaking to your pharmacist or GP.\nIt may not be healthy to cut these foods from your diet, especially in young children who need the calcium, calories and protein from these foods.\nIf your GP suspects you have a\u00a0food allergy, you may be referred to a dietitian (a specialist in diet and nutrition), who can help work out a way to avoid the food you're allergic to while ensuring you still get all the nutrition you need.\nAlternatively, you may be referred to a hospital specialist such as an immunologist, dermatologist or paediatrician.\nIf you are breastfeeding a baby with atopic eczema, get medical advice before making any changes to your regular diet.\nEmollients\nEmollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as atopic eczema.\nIn addition to making the skin feel less dry, they may also have a mild anti-inflammatory role, and can help reduce the number of flare-ups you have.\nSeveral different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as:\n\nan ointment for very dry skin\na cream or lotion for less dry skin\nan emollient to use instead of soap\nan emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower\none emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body\n\nThe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin.\nLotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.\nIf you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin.\nIf this is the case, your pharmacist will be able to recommend another product that suits you better. The best emollient is the one you feel happy using every day.\nUse your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school, or a tub in the bathroom and one in a living area.\nTo apply the emollient:\n\nuse a large amount\ndon't rub it in\u00a0\u2013 smooth it into the skin in the same direction the hair grows instead\nafter a bath or shower, gently pat the skin dry and\u00a0apply the emollient while the skin is still moist to keep the moisture in\n\nYou should use an emollient at least twice a day if you can, or more often if you have very dry skin.\nDuring a flare-up, apply generous amounts of emollient more frequently, but remember to treat inflamed skin with a topical corticosteroid\u00a0as emollients used\u00a0on their own\u00a0are not enough to control it.\nDon't put your fingers into an emollient pot \u2013 use a spoon or pump dispenser instead, as this reduces the risk of infection. And never share your emollient with other people.\nTopical corticosteroids\nIf your skin is sore and inflamed, your pharmacist may recommend a topical corticosteroid (applied directly to your skin), which can reduce the inflammation within a few days.\nTopical corticosteroids can be prescribed in different strengths, depending on the severity of your atopic eczema and the areas of skin affected.\nThey can be very mild (such as hydrocortisone), moderate (such as clobetasone butyrate), or even stronger (such as mometasone).\nIf you need to use corticosteroids frequently, see your GP regularly so they can check the treatment is working effectively and you are using the right amount.\nDon't be afraid to apply the treatment to affected areas to control your eczema. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. This will give details of how much to apply.\nMost people will only have to apply it once a day as there is no evidence there is any benefit to applying it more often.\nWhen using a topical corticosteroid:\n\napply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes until the emollient has soaked into your skin, or apply the corticosteroid at a different time of day (such as at night)\napply the recommended amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area\ncontinue to use it until 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared so the inflammation under the skin surface is treated\n\nOccasionally, your doctor may suggest using a topical corticosteroid less frequently, but over a longer period of time. This is designed\u00a0to help prevent flare-ups.\nThis is sometimes called \"weekend treatment\", where a person who has already gained control of their eczema uses the topical corticosteroid every weekend on the trouble sites to prevent them becoming active again.\nTopical corticosteroids may cause a mild stinging sensation for less than a minute as you apply them.\nIn rare cases, they may also cause:\n\nthinning of the skin\u00a0\u2013 especially if the strong steroids are used in the wrong places, such as the face, for too long (for example, several weeks)\nchanges in skin colour\u00a0\u2013 usually, skin\u00a0lightening after many months of using very strong steroids, but most lightening\u00a0after eczema is a \"footprint\" of old inflammation and nothing to do with treatments\nacne(spots)\u00a0\u2013 especially when used on the face in teenagers\nincreased hair growth\n\nMost of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.\nGenerally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for many months,\u00a0using them in sensitive areas such as the\u00a0face, armpits or groin, or using a large amount will increase your risk of side effects. For this reason, you should be prescribed the weakest effective treatment to control your symptoms.\nAntihistamines\u00a0\nAntihistamines are a type of medicine that blocks the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. They\u00a0can help relieve the itching associated with atopic eczema.\nThey can either\u00a0be sedating, which cause drowsiness,\u00a0or\u00a0non-sedating. If you have severe itching, your pharmacist may suggest trying\u00a0a non-sedating antihistamine.\nIf itching during a flare-up affects your sleep, your pharmacist may suggest taking a sedating\u00a0antihistamine. Sedating\u00a0antihistamines can cause drowsiness into the following day, so it may be helpful to let your child's school know they may not be as alert as normal.\nBandages and wet wraps\nIn some cases, your GP may prescribe special medicated bandages, clothing or wet wraps to wear over areas of skin affected by eczema.\u00a0\nThese can either be used over emollients or with topical corticosteroids to prevent scratching, allow the skin underneath to heal, and stop the skin drying out.\nCorticosteroid tablets\nCorticosteroid tablets\u00a0are rarely used to treat atopic eczema nowadays, but may occasionally be prescribed for short periods of 5\u00a0to 7\u00a0days to help bring particularly severe flare-ups under control.\nLonger courses of treatment are generally avoided because of the risk of potentially serious side effects.\nIf your GP thinks your condition may be severe enough to benefit from repeated or prolonged treatment with corticosteroid tablets, they will probably refer you to a specialist.\nSeeing a specialist\nIn some cases, your GP may refer you to a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist).\nYou may be referred if your GP is not sure what type of eczema you have, normal treatment is not your eczema, your eczema is affecting your daily life, or it's not clear what is causing it.\nA dermatologist may be able to offer the following:\n\na thorough review of your existing treatment \u2013 to make sure you are using enough of the right things at the right times\ntopical calcineurin inhibitors \u2013 creams and ointments that suppress your immune system, such as\u00a0pimecrolimus and tacrolimus\nvery strong topical corticosteroids\nbandages or wet wraps\nphototherapy \u2013 ultraviolet (UV) light that reduces inflammation\nimmunosuppressant tablets \u2013 to suppress your immune system, such as azathioprine, ciclosporin and methotrexate\nalitretinoin \u2013 medicine to treat severe eczema affecting the hands in adults\n\nA dermatologist may also offer additional support to help you use your treatments correctly, such as demonstrations from nurse specialists, and they may be able to refer you for psychological support if you feel you\u00a0need it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nPeople with atopic eczema can sometimes develop further physical and psychological problems.\nBacterial skin infections\nAs atopic eczema can cause your skin to become cracked and broken, there is a risk of the skin becoming infected with bacteria. The risk is higher if you scratch your eczema or do not use your treatments correctly.\nSigns of a bacterial infection can include:\n\nfluid oozing from the skin\na yellow crust on the skin surface\nsmall yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema\nthe skin becoming swollen and sore\na high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell\n\nYour normal symptoms may also get rapidly worse and your eczema may not respond to your regular treatments.\nYou should see your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child's skin may have become infected.\nThey will usually prescribe antibiotic tablets, capsules or cream to treat the infection, as well as making sure the skin inflammation that led to the infection is well controlled.\nSpeak to your pharmacist or GP if these don't help or your symptoms get worse.\nOnce your infection has cleared, your GP should prescribe new supplies of any creams and ointments you're using to avoid contamination. Old treatments should be disposed of.\nViral skin infections\nIt's also possible for eczema to become infected with the herpes simplex virus, which normally causes\u00a0cold sores. This can develop into a serious condition called eczema herpeticum.\nSymptoms of eczema herpeticum include:\n\nareas of painful eczema that quickly get worse\ngroups of fluid-filled blisters that break open and leave small, shallow open sores on the skin\na high temperature and generally feeling unwell, in some cases\u00a0\n\nContact your\u00a0doctor immediately if you think you or your child may have eczema herpeticum. If you cannot contact your GP, call NHS 111 or go to your nearest hospital.\nIf you are diagnosed with\u00a0eczema herpeticum, you will be given an antiviral medication called aciclovir.\nPsychological effects\nAs well as affecting you physically, atopic eczema may also affect you psychologically.\nPreschool children with atopic eczema may be more likely to have behavioural problems such as hyperactivity than children who do not have the condition. They are also more likely to be more dependent on their parents.\nSchoolchildren may experience teasing or bullying if they have atopic eczema. Any kind of bullying can be\u00a0traumatic and difficult for a child to deal with.\nYour child may\u00a0become quiet and withdrawn. Explain the situation to your child's teacher and encourage your child to tell you how they are feeling.\nThe National Eczema Society provides information about\u00a0regional support groups, where you may be able to meet other people living with atopic eczema.\nSleep-related problems are common among people with eczema.\nA lack of sleep may affect mood and behaviour. It may also make it more difficult to concentrate at school or work.\u00a0\nIf your child has problems sleeping\u00a0because of their\u00a0eczema,\u00a0they may fall behind with their schoolwork. It\u00a0might help\u00a0to let\u00a0their teacher know about their condition so it can be taken into consideration.\nDuring a severe\u00a0eczema flare-up, your child may need time off from school. This may also affect their ability to keep up with their studies.\nAtopic eczema can affect the self-confidence of both adults and children. Children may find it particularly difficult to deal with their condition, which may\u00a0lead to\u00a0them having a poor self-image.\nIf your child is severely lacking in confidence, it may affect their ability to develop social skills. Support and encouragement will help boost your child's self-confidence and give them a more positive attitude about their appearance.\nSpeak to your GP if you are concerned your child's eczema is severely affecting their confidence. They may benefit from specialist psychological support.\n\u00a0\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), usually called autism, is something you\u2019re born with. Autism means that the way you think about and experience the world is different to most people. This means you can behave differently to most people, and have different strengths and difficulties. For example, some autism characteristics (things you think, feel and do) can make it hard to express yourself in social situations, but you may also be particularly knowledgeable and passionate about topics that interest you.\nRead more about characteristics of autism here\nAutism is highly variable \u2013 the word \u2018spectrum\u2019 refers to how autism is experienced differently by different people. Autism is considered a spectrum because it\u2019s different for every autistic person \u2013 some autistic people might need more support than others to live the lives they want to lead. The way autism affects you can change as you grow and develop, and experience different environments.\nRead more about support here\nMany people who have been diagnosed with autism prefer using the term \u2018autistic\u2019 to describe themselves \u2013 this is known as identity-first language (for example, \u201cI\u2019m autistic\u201d). They consider autism to be part of their identity, not a condition to be treated.\nFor a long time people used the term \u2018person on the autism spectrum\u2019, known as person-first language (for example, \u201cI\u2019m on the autism spectrum\u201d), and some people still prefer this.\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll mostly use the term \u2018autistic\u2019.\nIf in doubt, you can always ask an autistic person what term they\u2019d prefer.\nIn the past, autism was broken down into several different diagnoses, including:\n\nAsperger\u2019s Syndrome\nautistic disorder\nKanner\u2019s Syndrome\nchildhood autism\natypical autism\nPervasive Development Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)\n\nBecause these diagnoses all had the characteristics of autism, they were removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism for short. People also use the term \u2018autism spectrum condition\u2019 (ASC).\nLearn more about autism from autistic people\nAt least 1 in 100 people in Scotland are autistic. Currently, between 1 in 3 and 1 in 4 people diagnosed with autism are assigned female at birth (AFAB).\nRead more about autism and gender\nAutism is always present from birth, but it might not be recognised or diagnosed until adulthood. Early intervention, in the form of support for their individual needs, can be helpful for autistic children.\nEven if you aren\u2019t diagnosed until adulthood, getting a diagnosis can be very helpful for identifying your strengths and the things you struggle with, and finding support.\nRead more about characteristics of autism\n\n\nEvery autistic person is different and has different experiences. However, there are some characteristics that are common in autistic people.\nThe way these characteristics show themselves can change with age, and also with the situation you\u2019re in.\nFor example:\n\nthe way you use language and talk might be different to most people\nyou may use facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures (hand and body movements) differently to most people\nmaking and maintaining friendships might be difficult for you\nyou may be good at seeing patterns or solutions, and be good at seeing solutions to problems that other people might not\nyou might have set ways of doing things, and find it difficult to do them differently\nautistic people are often very good at understanding and working with structured systems, for example languages, music, and computers\nyou may have good attention to detail, and be good at spotting mistakes\nyou might be passionately interested in certain things, and as a result learn a large amount about them in a short time \u2013 these interests can change throughout your life\nyou might avoid or seek out certain sensations, like loud noises or specific textures, more than most people, and experience them more strongly\nthere might be some foods you particularly enjoy and eat a lot of, and others that you can\u2019t be around due to their texture or smell\nwhen working on projects, you might find it difficult to think about the project as a whole \u2013 you may do a great job on your part of a group project, but struggle to imagine how it fits in with everyone else\u2019s part\nwhile autistic people can be good at paying attention to detail, you might find it difficult to leave out details that are accurate but not needed when talking to people or working on projects\nautistic people can be very determined and driven, and keep going with tasks or problems when other people may give up\nyou might find you\u2019re always determined to make sure things are \u2018perfect\u2019, and sometimes forget to eat or sleep if you\u2019re working on something\nit can be difficult for autistic people to work in groups where there isn\u2019t clear communication about what they\u2019re expected to do\n\nThere are a number of other possible signs that a healthcare professional will look for when assessing if someone is autistic.\nRead more about diagnosing autism here\nAt the moment, men and those assigned male at birth (AMAB) are diagnosed with autism more often than women and those assigned female at birth (AFAB). As more healthcare professionals now know what characteristics to look for, it\u2019s becoming more common for women and AFAB people to receive an autism diagnosis. However, recognising autism can take longer for women and AFAB people. This is because the signs healthcare professionals look for are the same for everyone, but women and AFAB people can often show different characteristics.\nWomen and AFAB people can be more likely to \u2018mask\u2019 autism \u2013 hiding\u00a0autism characteristics and copying what other people without autism do - in order to fit into groups. This can make it harder to recognise that they might be autistic, and to receive a diagnosis.\nSome environments can be very difficult for autistic people, due to the way they experience and interact with the world. Every autistic person finds different things difficult, but common examples are:\n\nsocial situations with no timetable or clear \u2018rules\u2019 on things like who speaks when \u2013 for example, parties and nights out\nbusy environments like concerts, supermarkets, and school playgrounds, where there might be a lot of different loud noises at once\n\nMany environments allow autistic people to feel more comfortable and be themselves. When autistic people are in an environment with people who understand their individual needs and characteristics, they\u2019re likely to:\n\nfeel more relaxed\nperform better at tasks\nfind it easier to learn\nuse less time and energy trying to fit in with their environment\n\nBecause every autistic person is different, it can take time to understand how you experience different environments. It may also take time to find the environments that suit your needs, and to learn which ones to avoid.\nIf there\u2019s an autistic person in your life, it\u2019s important to ask them what they\u2019d prefer and if there\u2019s anything you can do to make a new environment more comfortable for them.\nIf you\u2019re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, you can ask how they felt in situations, or look for signs that they\u2019re uncomfortable during or after being in different environments. Autistic children are often able to communicate best with those closest to them about what they enjoy and don\u2019t enjoy.\nRead more about finding the right environment\n\n\nThe signs of autism can be different depending on the person and how old they are.\nBecause autism is present from birth, it can usually be diagnosed in childhood. However, it may only be recognised later in life. Understanding of autism has grown over time, so more people are now being diagnosed when they\u2019re older if the signs weren\u2019t recognised when they were children.\nThese are signs of autism that health professionals look for when making a diagnosis, but an autistic person may not have all of these signs. For example, delayed speech (learning to speak later than most children), or a child not speaking at all, can be a sign of autism. However, many autistic children talk at the same age a child without autism would.\nIt\u2019s also possible that these signs are there, but they aren\u2019t caused by autism.\nIf you think you or your child might be autistic, talk to your GP or health visitor.\nThe signs of autism can change as children grow \u2013 babies and toddlers show different signs of autism than children aged 4 and older.\u00a0\nSigns of autism in babies and toddlers can include a number of things that affect different parts of their life and behaviour.\nAs children grow and experience different environments, such as nursery and school, the characteristics of autism can appear differently.\nThe characteristics of autism can affect you differently as you get older \u2013 you may also recognise some of the signs of autism in children in yourself as an adult. Many people are diagnosed with autism as teenagers or adults based on noticing that they think and behave differently from most other people.\nAs you age and experience different environments, you might notice different signs of autism.\nAs you age and experience different environments, life events, and circumstances, you might notice different signs of autism. You might also have developed coping strategies for environments you find difficult, changing the way you manage them.\nAutistic traits \u2013 meaning things that autistic people often do, think, and feel \u2013 are often shared by people who don\u2019t have autism too. This doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is \u2018a little bit autistic\u2019, or that autistic people don\u2019t need support.\nTo be diagnosed with autism, a person has to have a lot of autistic traits from birth, and those traits need to have a big effect on their life. In order to be diagnosed with autism, those traits must cause what a healthcare professional would call \u2018clinically significant difficulties\u2019 in their day-to-day life. This means that they have difficulties with day-to-day life due to their autistic traits and need to use their own ways of overcoming those difficulties, or the people in their life need to help them to overcome them, or both.\nBeing in a supportive environment makes a big difference to an autistic person\u2019s wellbeing and quality of life.\nLearn more about how autism is diagnosed\nPeople who have these conditions can be more likely to also have autism:\n\ndevelopmental disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or learning disability\nmuscular dystrophy\nDown's syndrome\ncerebral palsy\nepilepsy\nneurofibromatosis \u2013 a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves (the main types are neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2)\nrare genetic conditions, including fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis and Rett syndrome\n\nThe exact cause of autism is unknown, but researchers think it\u2019s at least partly genetic \u2013 that autism can run in the family. However, autism can also develop when there\u2019s no family history. There\u2019s no way to predict whether a child will be autistic, even if one or both of their parents are autistic.\nMore research is being done to find out which genes cause autism \u2013 it\u2019s thought to be caused by more than one.\n\n\nLike everyone else, autistic people can be happy and healthy in the right environment \u2013 however, the right environment for an autistic person can be different to the right environment for a non-autistic person.\nAutism doesn\u2019t mean that a person will need additional support to work, have relationships, or enjoy hobbies. However, many autistic people do need additional understanding or support to overcome the challenges caused by having autistic characteristics in a society where most people don\u2019t have them.\nThere\u2019s no cure for autism, and most autistic people wouldn\u2019t want to be \u2018cured\u2019 even if it was possible. Many autistic people feel autism is part of their identity, and not something to be cured or treated.\nBecause of the difficulties they can experience, autistic people may need treatment or support for other conditions, including:\n\nlow mood\nanxiety\nsleep problems\n\nPsychological therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are often used to treat depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, both in people who have autism and people who don\u2019t.\nPsychological therapies can help to manage conditions linked with autism, like anxiety, but psychological therapies aren\u2019t a treatment for autism itself. Therapy techniques might need to be adapted to work for an autistic person.\nDepending on what\u2019s offered by your NHS board and local organisations, there are therapies to help overcome the challenges that autistic people can experience.\nPossible therapies include:\n\nhelp with communicating, both for autistic people and the people in their lives\ngroups for autistic people to share experiences and advice\nsensory assessments and support with an occupational therapist to help find ways of managing and improving your environment and how you experience the world\ntraining courses for loved ones, to help them understand autism and offer the best possible support\n\nInterventions that aim to \u2018train out\u2019 behaviours (like repetitive movements, for example) or force autistic people to behave like non-autistic people are unethical and often harmful. However, many autistic people can benefit from support in learning skills to overcome some of the difficulties they experience \u2013 this is different to forcing someone to change their behaviour.\nFor example, an autistic adult might want to learn extra social skills to improve their relationships at work, or a therapist may work with a child and parent to help them to develop their communication skills.\nThese therapies don\u2019t aim to change a person\u2019s autism, but to give them skills they can use. If you\u2019re an autistic adult, the decision to have therapies for things like social skills should be yours. If you have an autistic child, any therapy they have should be with the aim of meeting their needs.\nLearn about avoiding harmful and unhelpful therapies for autism\nSometimes, when a situation is too much to cope with due to sensory input (things you see, hear, feel, smell or taste), or being asked to do things that cause stress or distress, an autistic person can become overwhelmed.\nWhen an autistic person becomes overwhelmed and isn\u2019t able to use or benefit from their coping strategies, they might have \u2018meltdowns\u2019 or \u2018shutdowns\u2019.\nIt\u2019s important, for parents of autistic children in particular, to be aware that a meltdown isn\u2019t a tantrum. A tantrum is something that a child can control, and tantrums often happen because a child wants something. A meltdown or shutdown isn\u2019t something an autistic person can control, and it\u2019s caused by being overwhelmed.\nDuring a meltdown, an autistic person might try to make themselves feel less overwhelmed. This can include doing things like:\n\ntrying to get away from people \u2013 for example by running away or hiding\ntrying to get people away from them \u2013 for example by shouting, screaming, hitting, or acting aggressively\u00a0\n\nDuring a shutdown, an autistic person might try to block everything out \u2013 for example by not responding to anything or anyone around them.\nRead more about meltdowns\nLike everyone else, autistic people can display challenging behaviour if they\u2019re in the wrong environment. While it can be challenging for the people around them, this behaviour is often a result of distress or frustration, particularly if an autistic person has difficulty with communicating.\nBehaviour that challenges others is usually a way for someone to get their needs met when they don\u2019t have any other way to do so. It\u2019s not \u2018bad\u2019 behaviour, or intended to cause harm. This kind of behaviour is most common in children, or people who find it hard to communicate their needs \u2013 for example, people with a learning disability.\nIf you\u2019re autistic, effective communication about your needs, and finding ways to have those needs met, can be helpful in reducing the distress that can lead to behaviour that challenges.\nIf someone in your life is autistic, or you\u2019re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, finding the right strategies for supporting their needs is important and helpful, and can be done if there\u2019s effective support for everyone involved.\nBehaviour that challenges can also be caused by:\n\ntrying to meet sensory needs \u2013 for example, wanting to do something because it feels nice, like rubbing soaps and creams all over themselves and the walls\nwanting something \u2013 for example, being hungry or wanting to play with a toy\nneeding assistance or attention \u2013 for example, because they're bored or want help with a project at school\ntrying to escape an environment or the people around them, but doing so in a way that can be dangerous or harmful, such as running into the road\n\nBehaviour that people can find challenging includes:\n\nbeing destructive \u2013 breaking things, for example\nbeing disruptive \u2013 making noise in class or throwing things, for example\nself-harm\naggression\n\nHelp is available for anyone experiencing distress that might result in behaviour that challenges. Finding support can help you identify the reasons behind this behaviour and find other ways of communicating and meeting needs. Contact your GP or the healthcare professional who usually supports you for\u00a0advice.\nEnvironment is important to quality of life for autistic people. There are ways you can adapt (change) and improve your environment to make it as comfortable and supportive as possible for you or your child.\nThe social model of disability is a way of looking at the world that treats the difficulties people with disabilities have as being caused by barriers in society, rather than just the disabilities themselves. These barriers can be physical \u2013 for example, buildings not having accessible toilets. Barriers can also be caused by people\u2019s attitudes \u2013 for example, many people will assume someone is lying because they don\u2019t make eye contact while talking.\nThe social model of disability can be a helpful way of considering the difficulties someone faces, and how to adapt their environment so it works for them.\nLearn more about the social model of disability\nAutism is covered by the Equality Act (2010), which means that schools and employers are required to make \u201creasonable adjustments\u201d to ensure autistic people are comfortable in their environment and able to learn or work.\nLearn more about the Equality Act (2010)\nCommon changes to an environment that can help autistic people include:\n\nsensory changes \u2013 for example, being given a quiet space to work, being able to use sensory toys like fidget spinners, or being allowed to make noises while working\ncommunication changes \u2013 for example, using email or apps to communicate, using very clear language, allowing additional time to ask questions, or using visual communication such as photos or pictures as well as written words\nroutine \u2013 keeping to a regular routine and giving warning of any changes as far in advance as possible\n\nEvery autistic person is likely to benefit from different changes \u2013 the best way to find the right ones is to ask an autistic person, or in the case of a child, their parents or caregivers.\nLearn more about autism from autistic people\n\n\nThere are many incorrect beliefs about autism, particularly the causes of autism or the best ways to overcome the challenges often faced by autistic people.\nThese things do not cause autism:\n\nbad parenting\nvaccines, or any ingredients in vaccines\ntrauma or distress at a young age\ndiet\ninfections\n\nThere\u2019s no cure for autism, but many people incorrectly believe there are ways to cure it, or to change the way autistic people experience and interact with the world.\nSome fake treatments are dangerous \u2013 even the ones that aren\u2019t dangerous are unethical, and none of them are helpful.\nHarmful and dangerous fake treatments include:\n\nany treatment that aims to \u2018train out\u2019 autistic behaviours, like forcing someone to stop making repetitive movements\nany treatment that aims to train autistic people to do things that cause them distress, in an attempt to change their behaviour and remove autistic characteristics\nhyperbaric oxygen therapy \u2013 treatment with oxygen in a pressurised chamber\nchelation therapy, which uses medication or other methods to remove metal from the body\nchlorine dioxide (CD), also called Mineral Miracle Solution (MMS) \u2013 this is a bleach solution given via enema which can cause severe distress and physical harm\nneurofeedback \u2013 where an autistic person\u2019s brain activity is monitored, usually by placing electrodes on their head, so they can see their brain activity on a screen and be told how to change it\nfacilitated communication \u2013 where a therapist or another person supports and guides an autistic person's hand or arm while using a device such as a computer keyboard or mouse\nauditory integration training \u2013 this involves an autistic person listening to music that has changes in tone, pitch, and volume\n\nThere are some treatments that don\u2019t have any evidence to suggest they\u2019re helpful, but also don\u2019t have evidence to suggest they\u2019re harmful as long as they\u2019re done safely. These include special diets, such as gluten-free or casein-free diets. Any special diet should only be done under the supervision of a dietician or nutritionist.\nIf you hear about a treatment that you want to try, always talk to your GP or the healthcare professional who usually supports you or your child first.\nThere are a number of ways to identify a fake treatment. People, organisations, or websites that promote fake treatments usually:\n\nclaim to \u2018cure\u2019 autism or help people \u2018recover\u2019 from autism\nclaim the treatment works quickly or instantly\nclaim the treatment can be done at home by anyone, and you don\u2019t need training or qualifications\nclaim you can\u2019t trust doctors to be honest with you, or say \u201cdoctors don\u2019t want you to know about this\u201d\nask autistic people, or parents of children with autism, to rely on their knowledge of their body or their child\u2019s body instead of considering scientific evidence that can tell you whether a treatment is harmful or helpful\nhave no scientific evidence to prove they work, such as peer-reviewed studies or information from the NHS\nmainly use personal stories as evidence that they work, which makes it hard to tell if the stories are true\nadvertise themselves with words like \u2018miracle\u2019, \u2018faith\u2019, and \u2018trust\u2019, or use religious phrases\ncharge a lot of money, and often require money to be paid on a regular basis\npromote treatments for autism that aren\u2019t available on the NHS, or claim to be \u2018experimental\u2019\n\nHealthcare professionals have put together information on what treatments are safe and unsafe, and on ways to support autistic people effectively.

It's involved in the production of semen.\nThe prostate produces a thick, white fluid that's made into a thinner\u00a0liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen.\nIf the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can\u00a0affect how you pass urine and may cause:\n\ndifficulty starting urination\na frequent need to urinate\ndifficulty fully emptying the bladder\n\nIn some men and anyone with a prostate, the symptoms are mild and don't require treatment. In others, the symptoms can be very troublesome and have a major impact on a person's quality of life.\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of benign prostate enlargement\nMany people worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.\u00a0This isn't the case. The risk of prostate cancer is no greater for people with an enlarged prostate than it is for those without an\u00a0enlarged prostate.\nWhat causes benign prostate enlargement?\nThe cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it's linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older.\nRead more about the causes of benign prostate enlargement\nHow is benign prostate enlargement diagnosed?\nIf your GP suspects that you have an enlarged prostate, you'll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms.\nEach question has five possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score indicates the severity of your symptoms.\nYour GP will also want to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to prostate enlargement.\u00a0\nYou may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a\u00a0blood test that measures PSA.\nRead more about diagnosing benign prostate enlargement\nTreating benign prostate enlargement\nTreatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms.\nIf you have mild to moderate\u00a0symptoms, you won't receive any immediate medical treatment, but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate.\nYou'll probably also be advised to make\u00a0lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine and\u00a0alcohol intake, and exercising regularly,\u00a0to see if they improve your symptoms.\nAs well as\u00a0lifestyle changes, medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.\u00a0Finasteride and dutasteride are medications\u00a0that are commonly used. They block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve associated symptoms.\nAlpha blockers may also be prescribed. They help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement.\nSurgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication.\nRead more about treating benign prostate enlargement\nComplications of benign prostate enlargement\nBenign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as a\u00a0urinary tract infection (UTI) or acute urinary retention. Serious complications are rare.\nRead more about the complications of benign prostate enlargement\nHow common is benign prostate enlargement?\nBenign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age.\n\n\nThe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are caused by the enlarged prostate placing pressure on the bladder and urethra (which carries urine from the bladder to the penis).\nThis can affect urination in a number of ways. For example, it can:\n\nmake it difficult for you to start urinating\nweaken the\u00a0flow of urine or cause \"stopping and starting\"\ncause you to strain to pass urine\ncause you to need to urinate\u00a0frequently\ncause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate\ncause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result in\u00a0urinary incontinence if you can't find a toilet quickly enough\ncause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully\ncause blood in the urine (haematuria)\n\nIn the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as\u00a0bladder stones,\u00a0bladder infections and kidney damage.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee\u00a0your GP if you notice any problems with, or changes to,\u00a0your usual pattern of urination. Even if the symptoms are mild, they could be caused by a condition that needs to be investigated.\nAny\u00a0blood in the urine must be investigated by your GP to rule out other more serious conditions.\n\n\nThe exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown, but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition's development.\nHormones are powerful chemicals that can have a wide range of effects on the cells of the body.\nOne theory is that as some men and anyone with a prostate gets older, the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increases, which may stimulate the growth of the prostate.\nAnother theory suggests that two hormones, testosterone and oestrogen, play a role. Younger men and anyone with a prostate produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as they get older, levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It's been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth.\nRisk factors\nResearch has shown that rates of benign prostate enlargement are higher among men and anyone with a prostate with high blood pressure and diabetes. However, both diabetes and high blood pressure are associated with the natural ageing process, so there may not be a direct connection between the three conditions.\n\n\nTo find out whether your prostate gland is enlarged, you'll need to have a few tests.\nSome tests will be carried out by your GP and others will be carried out by a urologist (a doctor who specialises in urinary problems).\nFirst, your GP will ask about your symptoms. If it seems that you have symptoms of benign prostate enlargement, the next stage is to calculate your\u00a0International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).\nInternational Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)\nYou'll be asked to complete\u00a0a\u00a0questionnaire\u00a0to assess your symptoms. Each question has\u00a0five possible answers that carry a score, and\u00a0your overall score\u00a0is used to assess the severity of your symptoms.\nThe checklist includes the following questions.\nOver the past month:\n\nHow often have you had the sensation of not completely emptying your bladder after urinating?\nHow often have you had to urinate again less than two hours after finishing urinating?\nHow often have you found that you stopped and started again when urinating?\nHow often have you found it difficult to postpone urination?\nHow often have you had a weak stream of urine?\nHow often have you had to push or strain to begin urinating during the course of one night?\nHow\u00a0often have\u00a0you had to\u00a0get up during the night to urinate?\n\nAfter your GP has assessed the severity your symptoms, they'll aim to rule\u00a0out other conditions\u00a0with similar symptoms using certain tests.\nRuling out other conditions\nThe\u00a0symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are similar to those of other conditions, including prostate cancer. Therefore, your GP will need to be completely sure that your symptoms aren't caused by cancer.\nA urine test can be used to check whether your symptoms are caused by an infection in your urinary system, such as a\u00a0kidney infection or bladder infection.\nYou may need\u00a0a\u00a0rectal examination to check whether you might have prostate cancer. Prostate cancer can cause the prostate gland to become hard and bumpy.\nYour GP will put on a glove and lubricate one of their fingers, before gently pushing this finger into your bottom and up into your rectum. As the rectum is close to the prostate gland, they'll be able to check whether the surface of the gland has changed. The procedure will feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn't usually painful.\nProstate cancer doesn't always cause changes to the prostate gland, so you may need to have some more specialised tests to rule it out. You will probably be referred to a urologist for these tests.\nA blood test can be used to measure the amount of the PSA protein that's produced by the prostate.\nA raised PSA level indicates enlargement of the prostate, and a significantly raised level may indicate prostate cancer. However, as with a rectal examination, a PSA test can't provide a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nA TRUS is a type of ultrasound scan specifically designed to study the prostate and the surrounding area.\nAn ultrasound probe is placed into your rectum and uses soundwaves to build a detailed image of your prostate.\nThis type of scan measures the size of your prostate and can be used to either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of prostate cancer.\nA CT urogram is used to study the urinary tract (the bladder and the tubes through which urine passes, also known as the ureter and urethra).\nA CT urogram can be used to check for blockages in your urinary system that could be causing your symptoms, such as a\u00a0kidney stone or bladder stone. It can also be used to detect any damage in the urinary tract.\nDuring a CT urogram, you\u2019ll be injected with a harmless radioactive dye, which will be visible on X-rays. After 30-60 minutes, the dye should have passed into your urinary tract and a series of X-rays will be taken. In some cases, you may be asked to pass urine before the final X-ray is taken.\nA voiding chart is a urination diary, which you may be asked to keep for 24 hours. You'll be asked to record how often you urinate, as well as details about how you urinate \u2013 for example, whether your urination is stopping and starting, or whether it's difficult to start urinating.\nA voiding chart is a good way of finding out more information about your symptoms and can be used to determine the type of treatment that would be most effective in controlling your symptoms.\nUroflowmetry measures the pressure of your bladder and how well your bladder works when you urinate.\nYou'll be given a\u00a0local anaesthetic and a small flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted into your urethra and moved up into your bladder.\nWater will then be injected through the catheter and into your bladder. A computer connected to the catheter measures the pressure inside your bladder and can assess how well your bladder is working.\nAs with voiding charts, uroflowmetry is a good way of determining what type of treatment will help to control your symptoms.\n\n\nThe treatment for an enlarged prostate gland will depend on how severe your symptoms are.\nThe three main treatments are:\n\nlifestyle changes\nmedication\nsurgery\n\nIf your symptoms are mild to moderate, you may not receive any immediate medical treatment, but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate gland. This is often referred to as \"watchful waiting\".\nYou may also be advised to make lifestyle\u00a0changes to see whether they improve your symptoms.\nThe various treatments for prostate enlargement\u00a0are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons\u00a0of the treatments for prostate enlargement, allowing you to compare your treatment options.\nLifestyle changes\nIf your prostate gland is enlarged, you may be advised to:\n\navoid drinking any liquids for one to two hours before going to bed \u2013 this will reduce your chances of waking up during the night to pass urine (nocturia)\nexperiment with the time you take prescribed medication \u2013 for example, taking it\u00a0at 7pm may help prevent nocturia\nstop drinking\u00a0alcohol and caffeine, or limit your consumption of them \u2013 these drinks\u00a0can irritate your bladder and make your symptoms worse\nexercise regularly\u00a0\u2013 research shows moderate exercise, such as walking for 30 to 60 minutes a day, can improve symptoms, although it's unclear exactly why this is the case\u00a0\njoin a patient support group \u2013 your doctor should be able to recommend one, which\u00a0may help you manage mild symptoms without the need for medication\n\nBladder training\nBladder training is an exercise programme that aims to increase the time between urination and the amount of urine your bladder can hold.\nYou'll be given a target, such as waiting at least two hours between each time you urinate.\nIt's a good idea to use a bladder training chart, which allows you to record each time you pass urine and the volume of urine passed\u00a0\u2013 you'll need a plastic jug to measure this. Your doctor should give you a chart to take home.\nYou'll also be taught a number of exercises, such as breathing, relaxation and muscle exercises, to help take your mind off the need to urinate.\nOver time your target time will be increased, and at the end of the programme you should find that you're able to go for longer without urinating.\nBladder training should only be carried out under medical supervision.\nMedication\nMedication, in combination with the lifestyle changes above, is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.\nFinasteride\u00a0and\u00a0dutasteride are widely used to treat benign prostate enlargement.\nThey block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve your associated symptoms.\nFind out about the\u00a0causes of prostate enlargement\nIf you're prescribed one of these medications, you may experience an immediate improvement in symptoms.\nHowever, you'll need to take it for at least six months to get the maximum benefit, and your doctor will need to monitor you every year.\nUse\u00a0condoms\u00a0if you're sexually active\u00a0\u2013\u00a0both finasteride and dutasteride can have an adverse effect on your sperm. If you get a woman pregnant, there's a risk the baby could develop birth defects.\nOther possible side effects can also\u00a0include\u00a0impotence and little or no\u00a0sperm when you ejaculate.\nIn many cases, these side effects will improve as your body gets used to the medication. See your GP if the side effects are troubling you.\nAlpha blockers help relax the muscles of your bladder, making it easier to pass urine. You may be prescribed alpha blockers as your primary treatment or in combination with finasteride.\nTamsulosin\u00a0and\u00a0alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Side effects of tamsulosin and alfuzosin are uncommon and usually mild.\nThey include:\n\ndizziness\u00a0\nheadaches\u00a0\nweakness\nlittle or no sperm when you ejaculate\n\nYou should only begin taking alpha blockers over a restful weekend when you're not planning to drive, as there's a risk they could cause low blood pressure (hypotension) and fainting.\nGenerally, if you experience dizziness while taking this medication, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until it's passed.\nSurgery\nSurgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement\u00a0that have failed to respond to medication.\nVarious procedures can be used to reduce the pressure on your bladder.\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)\u00a0involves inserting a small instrument called a resectoscope into your urethra, the\u00a0tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis.\nA wire loop heated by an electric current\u00a0is used to remove excess tissue from your prostate.\nTURP is carried out using either a general anaesthetic, where you're asleep, or a spinal anaesthetic, where you're awake, but the lower half of your body is numbed.\nThe procedure can take up to an hour, depending on how much tissue needs to be removed. Most people are well enough to leave hospital two to three days after the operation.\nAfter\u00a0surgery, you'll be unable to urinate normally at first\u00a0because of your swollen urethra.\u00a0\nA thin tube called a\u00a0catheter will be inserted into your urethra and up into your bladder to allow urine to drain away. This will usually be removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery.\nA common complication of TURP is you'll no longer produce semen when you ejaculate. This is known as retrograde ejaculation.\nIt causes sperm to go into your bladder rather than out of your penis during ejaculation. However, you'll still experience the physical pleasure associated with ejaculation (the climax).\nBladder neck incision\u00a0involves widening the urethra so it is easier to pass urine. It is also known as\u00a0transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP).\nLike TURP, the surgeon will insert a resectoscope into your urethra. The resectoscope has a heated wire loop at the end and is used to make small cuts (incisions) in the muscle where the prostate meets the bladder.\nThis type of surgery relaxes the opening to the bladder, helping urine flow out of it. As with TURP, TUIP\u00a0is carried out under a spinal or general anaesthetic.\nAfter surgery, you may not be able to urinate and a catheter may be needed to empty your bladder. Like TURP, you'll only need to use a catheter for a short time until you're able to urinate normally.\nThere's less of a risk of retrograde ejaculation with TUIP compared with TURP, although it can sometimes still occur.\nHolmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is similar to a TURP. Excess prostate tissue is removed using an instrument inserted through the urethra. However, it uses\u00a0a laser, rather than a wire loop.\nThere are some advantages to using this technique rather than a TURP, but also some disadvantages.\nIf you have been offered a HoLEP, you may want to ask your surgeon to explain why this was chosen for you, and the risks and benefits compared\u00a0with TURP.\nThe insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants is a new surgical procedure that can help relieve urinary symptoms.\nThe procedure can be carried out under\u00a0local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia.\nIt involves inserting tiny implants through the urethra.\u00a0The implants are then positioned to hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra so it isn't blocked.\nOne of the big advantages\u00a0of prostatic urethral lift implants compared with TURP\u00a0and TUIP is a reduced risk to your sexual function\u00a0\u2013 there is less chance of erectile dysfunction and ejaculation problems.\nThere's also less tissue injury, which means your recovery will be quicker and you won't need to stay in hospital as long.\nHowever, prostatic urethral lift implants\u00a0are unlikely to provide permanent symptom relief in all cases. And as it's a new procedure, the long-term outcomes are unknown and availability may be limited.\nRead more about the use of\u00a0prostatic urethral lift implants\u00a0to relieve symptoms of\u00a0prostate\u00a0enlargement.\nTransurethral vaporisation of the prostate (TUVP)\u00a0is similar to a TURP, but parts of the prostate are destroyed (vaporised) rather than cut away.\nStudies have shown that TUVP is as effective as TURP at improving symptoms. But some men and anyone with a prostate may need more treatment in the future.\nA laser can sometimes be used to destroy the prostate tissue. This particular form of TUVP is called photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (PVP), or Greenlight laser surgery.\nA thin, flexible instrument called a cytoscope is inserted into the urethra. A laser fibre is then passed through the\u00a0cytoscope to destroy the excess prostate tissue that is blocking the urine flow.\nThe procedure is recommended for those\u00a0who don't have a high risk of developing complications from treatment, such as men and anyone with a prostate who:\n\ndoesn't have urinary retention\ndoesn't have an increased risk of bleeding\nhas a prostate smaller than 100ml\n\nIn these \"low-risk\" groups,\u00a0Greenlight laser surgery is thought to be as effective as TURP, but also has several benefits.\nThese include:\n\na shorter hospital stay\u00a0\u2013 the procedure is often carried out as a day case\nthe catheter can be removed sooner\u00a0\nrecovery is quicker\nthere's a lower risk of complications\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website has more information about GreenLight XPS for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia.\nAn open prostatectomy is a procedure that may be more effective than TURP if you have severe benign prostate enlargement.\nHowever, it's now rarely used, even for larger prostates,\u00a0because other techniques have been\u00a0developed, such as HoLEP.\nDuring an open prostatectomy, an\u00a0incision will be made in your tummy and the outer portion of your prostate will be removed.\nThe procedure carries a higher risk of complications, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. There's also a greater chance that these complications will become permanent than if they occur after TURP.\n\n\nBenign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications, such as a urinary tract infection or acute urinary retention.\nUrinary tract infections\nIf you're unable to empty your bladder properly, there's a risk that bacteria in your urinary system won't get flushed out and will spread through the urine to cause a\u00a0urinary tract infection (UTI).\nSymptoms of a UTI\u00a0include:\n\ncloudy, bloody or bad-smelling urine\npain in your lower abdomen (tummy)\u00a0\nnausea\nvomiting\nshaking and chills\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\u00a0\n\nUTIs can be treated with antibiotics. A single UTI isn't usually serious, but repeated UTIs can damage your kidneys and bladder. If you have a history of repeated UTIs, you may need to have surgery.\nAcute urinary retention\nAcute urinary retention (AUR) is the sudden inability to pass any urine. AUR should be treated as a medical emergency, because without prompt treatment urine may be passed back up into the kidneys, which can damage them.\nSymptoms of AUR include:\n\nthe sudden inability to pass urine\nsevere lower abdominal pain\nswelling of the bladder that you can feel with your hands\n\nDial 999 and ask for an ambulance if you or someone you know experiences the symptoms of AUR.\nAUR can be treated using a thin tube (catheter) to drain the urine out of your bladder. In very serious cases, surgery may be required to empty the bladder.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a rare but aggressive type of cancer.\nThe bile duct system, or 'biliary' system, is made up of a series of tubes that begin in the liver and end in the small intestine. Bile is a fluid the digestive system uses to help break down fats and digest foods.\nSymptoms of bile duct cancer\nIn most cases, there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages, when symptoms can\u00a0include:\n\njaundice\u00a0\u2013 yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine\u00a0\nunintentional weight loss\nabdominal pain\n\nSpeak to your GP if you have signs of jaundice or are worried about other symptoms. While it is unlikely you have bile duct cancer, it is best to get it checked.\nRead more about the symptoms of bile duct cancer\nWhy does bile duct cancer happen?\nThe exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. However, some things\u00a0may increase your chances of developing the condition. The most common\u00a0include being over 65 years old or having\u00a0a\u00a0rare chronic liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).\nRead more about the causes of bile duct cancer\nTypes of bile duct cancer\nThere are 2 main types of bile duct cancer,\u00a0depending on where the cancer begins:\n\ncancer that starts in a part of the bile duct inside the liver is known as intrahepatic bile duct cancer\ncancer that starts in part of the bile duct outside the liver is known as extrahepatic bile duct cancer\n\nDiagnosis\nCancer of the bile duct can be difficult to diagnose, so you may need several tests, including:\u00a0\n\nblood tests\nultrasound scans\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scans\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\n\nFor some of these tests, you\u00a0may need to be injected with a special dye that highlights your bile ducts.\nYou may also\u00a0need a\u00a0biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of tissue so\u00a0it can be studied under a microscope. However, in some cases, your surgeon may prefer to remove the suspected tumour based on the results of your scans alone.\nRead more about diagnosing bile duct cancer\nHow is bile duct cancer treated?\nCancer of the bile duct\u00a0can usually only be cured if cancerous cells haven't spread. If this is the case, some or all of the bile duct\u00a0may be removed.\nOnly a small proportion of bile duct cancer cases are diagnosed early enough to be suitable for surgery. This is\u00a0because symptoms usually develop at a late stage.\nDespite this, treatment\u00a0such as\u00a0chemotherapy can relieve\u00a0the symptoms of bile duct cancer and improve the quality of life of people in the advanced stages of the condition.\nRead more about\u00a0treating bile duct cancer\nWho is affected?\nMost cases of bile duct cancer occur in people\u00a0over the age of 65. The condition affects men and women almost equally.\nCan bile duct cancer be prevented?\nThere are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, but you can reduce your chances of developing it.\nThe\u00a0most effective\u00a0ways of\u00a0achieving this are reducing your alcohol intake, as\u00a0cirrhosis is a risk factor,\u00a0and trying to ensure that you don't become infected with\u00a0hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\nRead more about preventing bile duct cancer\n\n\nBile duct cancer doesn't usually cause any symptoms until the flow of bile from the liver is blocked.\nIn most cases, the condition is at an advanced stage by this time.\nThe blockage will cause bile to move back into the blood and body tissue, resulting in symptoms such as:\n\njaundice\u00a0\u2013\u00a0yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine\nunintentional weight loss\u00a0\nabdominal pain \u2013 most people feel a dull ache in the upper right-hand side of their abdomen (stomach)\nhigh temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above and shivering\nloss of appetite\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nAlways visit your GP if you have jaundice. While jaundice is unlikely to be caused by bile duct cancer, it could indicate an underlying problem with the liver, such as hepatitis.\n\n\nThe exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown, although some things can increase the risk of developing the condition.\nCancer\u00a0begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nIf left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.\nIncreased risk\nA\u00a0number of\u00a0factors that increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer have been identified.\u00a0\nYour chances of developing cancer of the bile duct increase as you get older. Most people with the condition are over 65 years old.\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare type of liver disease that causes\u00a0long-lasting (chronic) inflammation of the liver.\nIt\u00a0usually occurs in people\u00a0aged 30\u00a0to 50. Up to 10% of people with ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the colon and rectum) also have PSC.\nAround 10\u00a0to 20% of people with PSC will develop bile duct cancer.\u00a0Your risk of developing bile duct cancer is thought to be higher if you have PSC and you smoke.\nSome people can have fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in their bile duct.\u00a0These cysts are usually congenital, which means\u00a0they are present from\u00a0birth.\nThe most common types are choledochal cysts and Caroli's disease, but both conditions are very rare.\nUp to 20%\u00a0of people with choledochal cysts that are not removed will develop cancer of the bile duct.\nBiliary stones are similar to gallstones, except they form inside the liver rather than inside the gallbladder.\nBiliary stones are rare in western Europe, but are relatively common in parts of Asia, such as Japan and Taiwan. It's estimated that approximately 10% of people with biliary stones will develop bile duct cancer.\nLiver flukes are a type of parasitic insect known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer. You can become infected with liver flukes by eating undercooked fish that has been contaminated with fluke eggs.\nLiver fluke infections are usually only a problem in Asia (especially Thailand) and Africa, where liver flukes are more widespread.\nExposure to certain chemical toxins is known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer.\nFor example, if you are exposed to a chemical called thorotrast, your chances of developing bile duct cancer rises. Thorotrast was widely used in radiography until it was banned during the 1960s after its dangerous properties were fully understood.\nOther toxins that may increase your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct include:\n\nasbestos \u2013\u00a0a fire-resistant material\u00a0that was widely used in construction and manufacturing, but is now banned in this country\npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) \u2013\u00a0a chemical that was used in manufacturing and building but, like asbestos, has now been banned\n\nThe following factors\u00a0are linked with an increased risk of developing bile duct cancer, but more research is still needed:\n\nhepatitis B\u00a0and hepatitis C\ncirrhosis (a scarred liver) as a result of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\nHIV\ndiabetes\nobesity\nsmoking\n\n\n\nBile duct cancer can be a challenging condition to diagnose. You usually need several different tests before an accurate diagnosis can be made.\nBlood tests\nIn bile duct cancer, the cancerous cells may release certain\u00a0chemicals that can be detected using blood tests. These are known as tumour markers.\nHowever, tumour markers can also be caused by other conditions.\u00a0A positive blood test does not necessarily mean you have bile duct cancer, and a negative blood test does not always mean\u00a0you don't.\nScans\nA number of scans can be used to examine your bile ducts in more detail and check for lumps or other abnormalities that could be the result of cancer. These scans include:\n\nultrasound scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0high-frequency sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your body\ncomputer tomography (CT) scan \u2013\u00a0a series of X-rays of your liver are taken and a computer is used to assemble them into a more detailed three-dimensional image\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 this uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a picture of the inside of your liver\n\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP)\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) allows your bile ducts show up more clearly on an X-ray scanner.\u00a0\u00a0\nA special dye is injected and the X-ray scanner is used to guide an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a camera at the end) down your throat and into your bile duct. The endoscope can detect blockages in your bile duct\u00a0that could be the result of bile duct cancer.\nA short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, may also be inserted into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely.\nAn advanced form of ERCP is a special test called a spyglass. This involves passing a specialised endoscope into the bile duct to detect abnormalities. It also enables a biopsy\u00a0to be taken.\nWhile this test can help confirm bile duct cancer in uncertain cases, it is very expensive and requires specialist training. Therefore, it is only available at a limited number of centres.\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is carried out to obtain a detailed X-ray image of your bile duct.\nThe side of your abdomen (tummy)\u00a0is numbed using\u00a0local anaesthetic, and\u00a0a special dye\u00a0that shows up on X-rays is injected through your skin and into your liver duct.\nAs with ECRP, a stent may be inserted during the procedure. PTC and ECRP\u00a0are both\u00a0useful ways of detecting any blockages in your bile duct that could be caused by bile duct cancer.\nBiopsy\nIf scans indicate\u00a0that you may have bile duct cancer, a\u00a0biopsy\u00a0may be\u00a0carried out to confirm a diagnosis.\nDuring\u00a0a biopsy, a small sample of tissue is taken from the body and checked under a microscope for\u00a0cancerous cells.\nA biopsy is usually performed while ERCP or PTC is being carried out. As well as taking bile and tissue samples from your bile duct, samples may be taken from nearby lymph nodes. This is to check whether the cancer has spread from your bile duct into your lymphatic system.\nStaging\nA widely used method of staging bile duct cancer is a number staging system. The stages are:\n\nstage 1A \u2013\u00a0the cancer is contained inside the bile duct\nstage 1B \u2013 the cancer is beginning to spread beyond the walls of the bile duct, but has not spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes\nstage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread into nearby tissue, such as the liver, but has not spread into the lymph nodes\nstage 3 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes\u00a0and\u00a0major blood vessels that supply the liver\nstage 4 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread into distant organs, such as the lungs\n\nRead more about staging bile duct cancer on the Cancer Research UK website\nCancer support\nIf you are diagnosed with cancer, the Alan Morement Memorial Fund (AMMF) is currently the only dedicated UK charity that provides support for people affected by bile duct cancer.\n\n\nMost cases of bile duct cancer cannot be cured. Instead, treatment is most commonly used to relieve symptoms.\nCancer treatment team\nDue to the rarity of bile duct cancer, you are likely to be referred to a specialist hepatobiliary unit\u00a0with experience in treating the condition.\nA multidisciplinary team (MDT) made up of different specialists\u00a0will help you decide on your treatment, but the final decision will be yours. Your MDT\u00a0may\u00a0include:\n\na liver surgeon \u2013 a specialist in treating cancers of the liver\na medical or clinical oncologist \u2013 a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer using techniques such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy\na pathologist \u2013 a specialist in diseased tissue\na radiologist \u2013 a specialist in\u00a0radiological diagnosis and intervention\u00a0\na cancer nurse\u00a0\u2013 who usually acts as the first point of contact between you and the rest of the care team\u00a0\na gastroenterologist \u2013 a specialist in the medical management of liver and biliary disease\n\nBefore going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the\u00a0advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nYour treatment plan\nYour recommended treatment plan will be determined by your general health and the\u00a0stage the cancer has reached.\nIn cases of stage 1 and stage\u00a02 bile duct cancer, a cure may be possible by surgically removing the affected part of the bile duct, and possibly some of the liver or gallbladder.\nIn cases of stage 3 bile duct cancers, the chances of achieving a successful cure will depend on how many lymph nodes have been affected. A cure may be possible if only a few nodes have cancerous cells in them, or it may be possible to slow the spread of the cancer by surgically removing the lymph nodes.\nIn cases of stage\u00a04 bile duct cancer, achieving a successful cure is highly unlikely. However, stenting, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can often be used to help relieve the symptoms.\nYour treatment plan may also be different if you have intrahepatic bile duct cancer, as this is usually treated in a similar way to liver cancer. Read more about treating liver cancer.\nA number of experimental treatments may be available as part of a clinical trial.\nSurgery\nIf your MDT thinks it is possible to cure your bile duct cancer, surgery will be needed to remove any cancerous tissue. Depending on the extent of the cancer, it may be necessary to remove:\n\nthe part of your bile duct that contains cancerous cells\nyour gallbladder\nnearby lymph nodes\na large part\u00a0of your liver\n\nAfter surgery, it is usually possible to reconstruct what remains of the bile duct so that bile can still\u00a0flow into the intestine.\nSimilarly, it is often possible for the liver to resume normal function after surgery because we do not need all of our liver. The liver can also regenerate itself after surgery.\nYou may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks or more after having bile duct cancer surgery before you are well enough to go home.\nSuccess rates of bile duct surgery depend on individual circumstances, such as whether nearby lymph nodes are free of cancer and whether it was possible to remove all of the cancerous cells during surgery.\nUnblocking the bile duct\nIf your bile duct becomes blocked as a result of cancer, treatment to unblock it may be recommended. This will help resolve symptoms such as:\n\njaundice \u2013\u00a0yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes\nitchy skin\nabdominal (tummy) pain\n\nUnblocking the bile duct is sometimes necessary if the flow of bile back into your liver starts to affect the normal functioning of your liver.\nThe bile duct can be unblocked by using a small tube called a stent.\u00a0The stent widens the bile duct, which should help to get the bile flowing again.\nA stent can be inserted using either:\n\na\u00a0variation of the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which uses an endoscope to guide the stent into the bile duct\na\u00a0variation of the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) procedure, which involves making a small incision (under local anaesthetic) in your abdominal wall\n\nOccasionally, an implanted stent can become blocked. If this occurs, it will need to be removed and replaced.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy is not a standard treatment for bile duct cancer, but\u00a0may help to relieve the symptoms, slow the spread of the cancer and prolong life. The types of radiotherapy are used to treat bile duct cancer:\n\nexternal beam radiotherapy \u2013 a machine is used to target radioactive beams at your bile duct\ninternal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) \u2013 a radioactive wire is placed inside your bile duct next to the tumour\n\nRadiotherapy works by damaging the cancerous cells. However, it can also damage healthy cells and cause side effects. Side effects of radiotherapy include:\n\nnausea (feeling sick)\nvomiting\nfatigue (severe tiredness)\n\nRead more about\u00a0radiotherapy\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is used in a similar way to radiotherapy to relieve the symptoms of cancer, slow down the rate it spreads and prolong life. It is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy.\nMedicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as cancerous tissue, and adverse side effects are common. Side effects of chemotherapy can include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\nfatigue\nhair loss\n\nHowever, these side effects should stop once the course of treatment has finished. Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nRead more about chemotherapy\nClinical trials and experimental treatments\nThe treatments for bile duct cancer are not as effective as treatments for other types of cancer. Therefore, a number of clinical trials are being conducted to find better ways of treating the condition.\nFor example, ongoing trials are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medicines, which may help\u00a0extend the lifespan of someone with bile duct cancer.\nAnother promising field of research involves using targeted therapies to treat bile duct cancer. Targeted therapies are medications\u00a0that target the processes that cancerous cells need to grow and reproduce.\nIn studies for some cancers, a medication called sorafenib has proved reasonably effective. Sorafenib works by blocking a protein that cancerous cells need to create a blood supply. However, sorafenib is not currently used as a routine treatment for bile duct cancer.\nAs bile duct cancer is a rare condition, there is a possibility you may be invited to take part in a clinical trial looking\u00a0at the use of these types of experimental treatments.\nAll clinical trials are carried out under strict ethical guidelines based on the principles of patient care. However, there is no guarantee that the treatment you receive during a clinical trial will be more effective, or even as effective, as existing treatments.\nRead more about clinical trials\u00a0and clinical trials for bile duct cancer\n\n\nThere are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, although it\u00a0is possible to reduce your chances of developing the condition.\nThe 3 most effective steps to reduce your chances of developing bile duct cancer are:\n\ngiving up smoking (if you smoke)\ndrinking alcohol in moderation\nminimising your exposure to the\u00a0hepatitis B and\u00a0hepatitis C viruses\n\nStopping smoking\nNot smoking\u00a0is the most effective way of preventing bile duct cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, such as stroke, heart attack and lung cancer.\nIt is particularly important to\u00a0stop smoking if you have the liver condition known as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). If you have PSC, smoking will significantly increase your chances of developing bile duct cancer.\nYour GP can advise\u00a0on how to give up smoking. They can\u00a0also recommend and prescribe suitable medication. You can get more information and advice from the\u00a0Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0advice and support service.\nRead more about\u00a0stopping smoking\nAlcohol\nIf you are a heavy drinker, reducing your alcohol intake will help prevent liver damage (cirrhosis). This may, in turn, reduce your risk of developing bile duct cancer.\nReducing your alcohol consumption is particularly important if you have a pre-existing liver condition, such as PSC or hepatitis B or C.\nRead low-risk drinking guidelines\nVisit your GP if you are finding it difficult to moderate your alcohol consumption. Counselling and medication are available to help reduce the amount you drink.\nRead more about alcohol\nHepatitis C\nIf you regularly inject drugs, the best way to avoid getting hepatitis C is to never share any of your drug-injecting equipment with others.\nYou should also avoid sharing any object that could be contaminated with blood, such as razors and toothbrushes.\nThere is less risk of getting hepatitis C by having sex with someone who is infected. However, as a precaution it is best to use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, with a new partner.\nRead more about\u00a0preventing hepatitis C\nHepatitis B\nA vaccine is available that provides immunisation against\u00a0hepatitis B.\u00a0\nVaccination would usually only be recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as:\n\npeople who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs\npeople who change their sexual partner frequently\npeople travelling to or from a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread\nhealthcare workers who may have come into contact with the virus\n\nPregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B. If they are infected, their baby can be vaccinated shortly after birth to prevent them also becoming infected.\nRead more detailed information about hepatitis B vaccination\nThe liver fluke\nThe liver fluke is a major cause of bile duct cancer in Asia. It is a parasite which, after infection, damages the tissue of the bile duct and in some cases triggers the onset of bile duct cancer.\nThe liver fluke is widespread in Thailand. Other countries where the liver fluke can be found include:\n\nCambodia\nLaos\nVietnam\n\nInfection occurs after eating raw or undercooked fish contaminated by fluke eggs.\nAlways ensure any fish you eat is cooked thoroughly when travelling in these countries.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Binge eating is an eating disorder where a person feels they have to overeat through regular binges.\nPeople who binge eat consume very large amounts of food over a short period of time, even when they\u2019re not hungry.\nBinges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying \u2018special\u2019 binge foods.\nIn some cases, people describe themselves as being in a \u2018dazed\u2019 state during a binge \u2013 particularly binges during the night \u2013 and can\u2019t remember what they ate.\nPeople who binge eat feel they have no control over their eating. They often binge in private because they feel embarrassed, guilty or disgusted with their behaviour after they\u2019ve finished eating.\nEpisodes of binge eating sometimes alternate with periods where the person cuts down on the amount of food they eat. This can lead to a vicious cycle that\u2019s difficult to break, where blood sugar levels rise and fall rapidly. Your blood sugar level affects how hungry you feel and how much energy your body has. When the levels go up and down quickly, this sends false messages to the brain and causes cravings for food when your body doesn't need it.\nHow common is it?\nAnyone can be affected by binge eating. It\u2019s estimated that there\u2019s around a 1 in 30 to 1 in 50 chance of a person developing binge eating disorder at some point during their life.\nIt\u2019s most common for the condition to develop in young adults. It can take a long time for people to feel able to seek help.\nMany people occasionally overeat \u2013 this doesn't necessarily mean you have binge eating disorder. However, if you\u2019re worried about your eating habits, the best thing to do is talk to your GP.\nTreating binge eating disorder\nBinge eating disorder can be treated using a number of talking therapies, including guided self-help and cognitive behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED).\nLearn more about talking therapy\nLearn more about self-help therapies\nThese treatments can help you overcome the psychological issues associated with your binge eating, but they won't usually have a significant impact on your weight.\nIf you\u2019re worried you have binge eating disorder, the first step is to go to your GP for a medical check-up and advice on how to get treatment.\nFind a local GP using Scotland's Service Directory\n\n\nThe main sign of binge eating disorder is if someone is bingeing on a regular basis. There are a number of signs that an episode of overeating is actually a binge, including:\n\nyou eat much faster than normal\nyou eat until you feel uncomfortably full\nyou eat a large amount of food when you are not hungry\nyou eat alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you are consuming\nyou have feelings of guilt, shame or disgust afterwards\n\nIf you feel like you have to purge what you\u2019ve eaten after a binge in order to avoid gaining weight, you may have symptoms of bulimia.\nIf binges don\u2019t happen regularly, and your weight is very low, you may have symptoms of anorexia.\nThe main type of psychological treatment for binge eating disorder is guided self-help. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own, and have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist). These activities can include filling out worksheets, keeping a food diary and meal plan, and writing about difficult thoughts and feelings.\nAnother treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), either individually or as part of a group. CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. If problems in your life are causing you to binge eat, CBT helps you to reduce bingeing and identify the underlying issues so you\u2019re less likely to binge in the future.\nLearn more about talking therapies\nAntidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used alongside guided self-help or talking therapies to treat binge eating disorder. The SSRI usually recommended to treat binge eating disorder is called fluoxetine (brand name Prozac).\nAs with any antidepressant, an SSRI will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You\u2019ll usually be started on a low dose, which is then gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.\nWhen you start taking an SSRI, see your GP after 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks to check your progress and to see if you\u2019re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it's important your progress is carefully monitored.\nVery few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It\u2019s also best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease.\n\n\nIt's not clear what causes binge eating, but, like many eating disorders, it's seen as a way of coping with feelings of unhappiness and low self-esteem.\nMany people who develop binge eating disorder share certain patterns of thinking and behaving that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include:\n\na tendency towards depression and anxiety\nfinding it difficult to handle stress, anger, boredom or loneliness\nlow self-esteem and a lack of confidence\nfeeling dissatisfied with your body and under pressure to be thin\nfrequently worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future\nfinding it hard to express feelings\nexperiencing unwanted thoughts, images or urges that make them feel they have to behave in certain ways\n\nBinge eating is often a way of coping with distress, and the above factors can make it harder for someone to cope with distress in a healthy way.\nEnvironmental factors are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.\nStressful life changes \u2013 for example, moving house, the breakdown of a relationship, going to college or university, or a bereavement \u2013 can make a person more likely to start binge eating as a way of coping.\nCulture and society may also play a part. People of all ages are exposed to a wide range of media messages promoting the idea that only certain body shapes are desirable, and that not having the \u2018ideal\u2019 body is something to be ashamed of. Even health advice that\u2019s intended to be helpful can have a focus on the risks of being overweight, which can add to feelings of pressure and low self-esteem.\nOther environmental factors that can contribute towards binge eating disorder include:\n\npressure and stress at school, such as exams or bullying \u2013 particularly if someone is bullied about body weight or shape\nhaving a family that places high value on body shape, and praises or rewards weight loss\ndifficult family relationships\nstressful or traumatic events in your past\n\nThe risk of developing binge eating disorder is thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders. This suggests that genetics could contribute to developing binge eating disorder.\nAs with other mental health conditions, like depression, people with binge eating disorder might have some differences in the way their brains work compared to people who don\u2019t have the condition. These differences may affect the part of the brain that\u2019s linked to appetite and body image.\nLong term physical effects of binge eating\nBinge eating often leads to weight gain. Being overweight or obese can put you at risk of a number of physical health problems, some of which can be life threatening.These include:\n\nhigh cholesterol and high blood pressure\ndiabetes\nosteoarthritis\nsome types of cancer, such as breast cancer and bowel cancer\n\nIf you think you might have a binge eating problem, it\u2019s important to know that there\u2019s help available. You can get support to tackle both the physical and mental effects of binge eating.\n\n\nIf you have eating problems or think you may have binge eating disorder, it\u2019s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:\n\ntalking to someone you trust, such as a friend or member of your family\ngoing to see your GP \u2013 you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support\n\nIf someone close to you is showing signs of binge eating disorder, you can offer help and support.\nYou could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.\nIf you\u2019d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own GP, can provide information on:\n\nthe treatments available\nhow you can support them during their treatment\n\nA leading charity for people with eating disorders is Beat, which has a range of information on the help and support available for people with eating disorders, and their friends and families.\nThere are a number of self-help books that you may find useful, for example Overcoming Binge Eating by Christopher Fairburn. Your GP and care team can recommend helpful resources.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression, is a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another.\nPeople with\u00a0bipolar disorder have periods or episodes of:\n\ndepression \u2013 feeling very low and lethargic\nmania \u2013 feeling very high and overactive (less severe mania is known as hypomania)\n\nSymptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you're experiencing. Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a \"normal\" mood very often.\nDepression\nYou may initially be diagnosed with\u00a0clinical depression before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which\u00a0you may be\u00a0diagnosed with\u00a0bipolar disorder.\nDuring an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide.\nIf you're feeling suicidal or having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or local mental health emergency services as soon as possible.\nIf you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans, free of charge,\u00a0on 116 123. You can talk to them\u00a024 hours a day,\u00a07 days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website.\nMania\nDuring a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may feel very happy and have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas. You may spend large amounts of money on things you can't afford and wouldn't normally want.\nNot feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase.\nYou may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. However, you may also experience symptoms of\u00a0psychosis, where you see or hear things that aren't there or become convinced of things that aren't true.\nLiving with bipolar disorder\nThe high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life.\nHowever, there are several options for\u00a0treating bipolar disorder that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible.\nThe following treatment options are available:\n\nmedication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression\u00a0\u2013\u00a0these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis\nmedication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur\nlearning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania\npsychological treatment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships\nlifestyle advice\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on\u00a0improving your diet and getting more sleep\n\nIt's thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder.\nHelp and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers\u00a0is also available\u00a0from charities, support groups and associations.\nThis includes self-help and self-management advice, and learning to\u00a0deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition.\nFind out more about living with bipolar disorder\nBipolar disorder and pregnancy\nBipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it.\nWhat causes bipolar disorder?\nThe exact\u00a0cause of bipolar disorder\u00a0is unknown, although it's believed a number of things can trigger an episode. Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors.\nWho's affected?\nBipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life.\nBipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to\u00a0develop bipolar disorder.\nThe pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and\u00a0are stable in between, while others have many episodes.\n\n\nBipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings. These can range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression).\nEpisodes of mania and depression often last for several weeks or months.\nDepression\nDuring a period of depression, your symptoms may include:\n\nfeeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time\nlacking energy\ndifficulty concentrating and remembering things\nloss of interest in everyday activities\nfeelings of emptiness or worthlessness\nfeelings of guilt and despair\nfeeling pessimistic about everything\nself-doubt\nbeing delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking\nlack of appetite\ndifficulty sleeping\nwaking up early\nsuicidal thoughts\n\nMania\nThe manic phase of bipolar disorder may include:\n\nfeeling very happy, elated or overjoyed\ntalking very quickly\nfeeling full of energy\nfeeling self-important\nfeeling full of great new ideas and having important plans\nbeing easily distracted\nbeing easily irritated or agitated\nbeing delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking\nnot feeling like sleeping\nnot eating\ndoing things that often have disastrous consequences \u2013\u00a0such as spending large sums of money on expensive and sometimes unaffordable items\nmaking decisions or saying things that are out of character and that others see as being risky or harmful\n\nPatterns of depression and mania\nIf you have bipolar disorder, you may have episodes of depression more regularly than episodes of mania, or vice versa.\nBetween episodes of depression and mania, you may sometimes have periods where you have a \"normal\" mood.\nThe patterns aren't always the same and some people may experience:\n\nrapid cycling\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a person with bipolar disorder repeatedly swings from a high to low phase quickly without having a \"normal\" period in between\nmixed state\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a person with bipolar disorder experiences symptoms of\u00a0depression and mania together; for example, overactivity with a depressed mood\n\nIf your mood swings last a long time but aren't severe enough to be classed as bipolar disorder, you may be diagnosed with cyclothymia\u00a0(a mild form of bipolar disorder).\nLiving with bipolar disorder\nBipolar disorder is a condition of extremes.\u00a0A person with the condition may be unaware they're in the manic phase.\nAfter the episode is over, they may be shocked at their behaviour. However, at the time, they may believe other people\u00a0are being negative or unhelpful.\nSome people with bipolar disorder have more frequent and severe episodes than others.\u00a0The extreme nature of the condition means\u00a0staying in a job may be difficult and relationships may become strained. There's also an increased risk of suicide.\nDuring episodes of mania and depression, someone with bipolar disorder may experience strange sensations, such as seeing, hearing or smelling things that aren't there (hallucinations).\nThey may also believe things that seem irrational to other people (delusions). These types of symptoms are known as\u00a0psychosis or a psychotic episode.\nRead more about\u00a0living with bipolar disorder\n\n\nThe exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Experts believe there are a number of factors that work together to make a person more likely to develop the condition.\nThese are thought to be a complex mix of physical, environmental and social factors.\nChemical imbalance in the brain\nBipolar disorder is widely believed to be the result of chemical imbalances in the brain.\nThe chemicals responsible for controlling the brain's functions are called neurotransmitters and include\u00a0noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine.\nThere's some evidence that if there's an imbalance in the levels of one or more neurotransmitters, a person may develop some\u00a0symptoms of bipolar disorder.\nFor example, there's evidence that episodes of mania may occur when levels of noradrenaline are too high, and episodes of depression may be the result of noradrenaline levels becoming too low.\nGenetics\nIt's also thought bipolar disorder is linked to genetics, as the condition seems to run in families. The family members of a person with the condition have an increased risk of developing it themselves.\nHowever, no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder. Instead, a number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to act as triggers.\nTriggers\nA stressful circumstance or situation often triggers the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Examples of stressful triggers include:\n\nthe breakdown of a relationship\nphysical, sexual or emotional abuse\nthe death of a close family member or loved one\n\nThese types of life-altering events can cause episodes of depression at any time in a person's life.\nBipolar disorder may also be triggered by:\n\nphysical illness\nsleep disturbances\noverwhelming problems in everyday life \u2013\u00a0such as problems with money, work or relationships\n\n\n\nIf your GP thinks you may have bipolar disorder, they'll usually refer you to a psychiatrist (a medically qualified mental health specialist).\nIf your illness puts you at risk of harming yourself, your GP will arrange an appointment immediately.\nSpecialist assessment\nYou'll be assessed by the psychiatrist at your appointment. They'll ask you a few questions to determine if you have bipolar disorder.\u00a0If you do, they'll decide what treatments are most suitable.\nDuring the assessment, you'll be asked about your symptoms and when you first experienced them. The psychiatrist will also ask about how you feel leading up to and during an episode of mania or depression, and if you have thoughts about harming yourself.\nThe psychiatrist will also want to know about your medical background and family history, especially whether any of your relatives have had bipolar disorder.\nIf someone else in your family has the condition, the psychiatrist may want to talk to them. However, they'll ask for your agreement before doing so.\nOther tests\nDepending on your symptoms, you may also need tests to see whether you have a physical problem, such as an\u00a0underactive thyroid or an overactive thyroid.\nIf you have bipolar disorder, you'll need to visit your GP regularly for a physical health check.\n\n\nTreatment for bipolar disorder aims to reduce the severity and number of episodes of depression and mania to allow as normal a life as possible.\nTreatment options for bipolar disorder\nIf a person isn't treated, episodes of bipolar-related\u00a0mania can last for between\u00a0three and\u00a0six months. Episodes of depression tend to last longer, for between\u00a0six and 12 months.\nHowever, with effective treatment, episodes usually improve within about\u00a0three months.\nMost people with bipolar disorder can be treated using a combination of different treatments. These can include one or more of the following:\n\nmedication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression \u2013 these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis\nmedication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur\nlearning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania\npsychological treatment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as talking therapies, which help you deal with depression and provide advice on how to improve relationships\nlifestyle advice\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, and advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep\n\nRead more about living with bipolar disorder\nMost people with bipolar disorder can receive most of their treatment without having to stay in hospital.\nHowever, hospital treatment may be needed if your symptoms are severe, or if you're being treated under the Mental Health Act, as there's a danger you may\u00a0self-harm or hurt others.\nIn some circumstances,\u00a0you could have treatment in a day hospital and return home at night.\nMedication\nSeveral\u00a0medications are available to help stabilise mood swings. These are commonly referred to as mood stabilisers and include:\n\nlithium carbonate\nanticonvulsant medicines\nantipsychotic medicines\n\nIf you're already taking medication for bipolar disorder and you develop depression, your GP will check you're taking the correct dose. If you aren't, they'll change it.\nEpisodes of depression are treated slightly differently in bipolar disorder, as the use of antidepressants alone may lead to a hypomanic relapse.\nMost guidelines suggest depression in bipolar disorder can be treated with just a mood stabiliser. However, antidepressants are commonly used alongside a mood stabiliser or antipsychotic.\nRead more about antidepressants\nIf your GP or psychiatrist recommends you stop taking medication for bipolar disorder, the dose should be gradually reduced over at least four weeks, and up to three months if you are taking an antipsychotic or lithium.\nIf you have to stop taking lithium for any reason, see your GP about taking an antipsychotic or valproate instead.\nLithium carbonate\nIn the UK, lithium carbonate (often referred to as just lithium) is the medication most commonly used to treat bipolar disorder.\nLithium is a long-term method of treatment for episodes of mania, hypomania and depression. It's usually prescribed for at least six months.\nIf you're prescribed lithium, stick to the prescribed dose and don't stop taking it suddenly (unless told to by your doctor).\nFor lithium to be effective, the dosage must be correct. If it's incorrect, you may get side effects such as diarrhoea and vomiting. However, tell your doctor immediately if you have side effects while taking lithium.\nYou'll need regular blood tests at least every three months\u00a0while taking lithium.\u00a0This is\u00a0to make sure your lithium levels aren't too high or too low.\nYour kidney and thyroid function will also need to be checked every two\u00a0to\u00a0three months if the dose of lithium is being adjusted, and every 12 months in all other cases.\nWhile you're taking lithium, avoid using\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, unless they're prescribed by your GP.\nIn the UK, lithium and the antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole are currently the only medications licensed for use in\u00a0adolescents with bipolar disorder who are aged 13 or over.\nHowever, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health states that unlicensed medicines may be prescribed for children if there are no suitable alternatives and their use can be justified by expert agreement.\nAnticonvulsant medicines\nAnticonvulsant medicines include:\n\nvalproate\u00a0\ncarbamazepine\nlamotrigine\n\nThese medicines are sometimes used to treat episodes of mania. They're also long-term mood stabilisers.\nAnticonvulsant medicines are often used to treat epilepsy, but they're also effective in treating bipolar disorder.\nA single anticonvulsant medicine may be used, or they may be used in combination with lithium\u00a0when the condition doesn't respond to lithium on its own.\nValproate isn't usually prescribed for women of childbearing age because there's a risk of physical defects to babies such as spina bifida, heart abnormalities and cleft lip.\u00a0There may also\u00a0be an increased risk of developmental problems such as\u00a0lower intellectual abilities, poor speaking and understanding, memory problems, autistic spectrum disorders and delayed walking and talking.\nLearn more about the risks of valproate medicines during pregnancy\nIn women, your GP may decide to use valporate if there's no alternative or if you've been assessed and it's unlikely you'll respond to other treatments, although they'll need to check you're using a reliable contraception and advise you on the risks of taking the medicine during pregnancy.\nIf you're prescribed valproate, you'll need to visit your GP to have a blood count when you begin the medication, and then again six months later.\nCarbamazepine is usually only prescribed on the advice of an expert in bipolar disorder. To begin with, the dose will be low and then gradually increased.\nYour progress will be carefully monitored if you're taking other medication, including the contraceptive pill.\nBlood tests to check your liver and kidney function will be carried out when you start taking carbamazepine, and again after six months.\nYou'll also need to have a blood count at the start and after six months, and you may also have your weight and height monitored. \u00a0\nIf you're prescribed lamotrigine, you'll usually be started on a low dose, which will be increased gradually.\nSee your GP immediately if you're taking lamotrigine and develop a rash. You'll need to have an annual health check, but other tests aren't usually needed.\nWomen who are taking the contraceptive pill should talk to their GP about taking a different method of contraception.\nAntipsychotic medicines\nAntipsychotic medicines are sometimes prescribed to treat episodes of mania or hypomania. Antipsychotic medicines include:\n\naripiprazole\nolanzapine\nquetiapine\nrisperidone\n\nThey may also be used as a long-term mood stabiliser. Quetiapine may also be used\u00a0for long-term bipolar depression.\nAntipsychotic medicines can be particularly useful if symptoms are severe or behaviour is disturbed. As antipsychotics can cause side effects\u00a0\u2013 such as blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation and weight gain\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the initial dose will usually be low.\nIf you're prescribed an antipsychotic medicine, you'll need to have regular health checks at least every three months, but possibly more often, particularly if you have diabetes. If your symptoms don't improve, you may be offered lithium and valproate as well.\nAripiprazole is also recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an option for treating moderate to severe manic episodes in adolescents with bipolar disorder.\nRapid cycling\nYou may be prescribed a combination of lithium and valproate if you experience rapid cycling (where you quickly change from highs to lows without a \"normal\" period in between).\nIf this doesn't help, you may be offered lithium on its own or a combination of lithium, valproate and lamotrigine.\nHowever, you won't usually be prescribed an antidepressant unless an expert in bipolar disorder has recommended it.\nLearning to recognise triggers\nIf you have bipolar disorder, you can learn to recognise the warning signs of an approaching episode of mania or depression.\nA community mental health worker, such as a psychiatric nurse, may be able to help you identify your early signs of relapse from your history.\nThis won't prevent the episode occurring, but it will allow you to get help in time.\nThis may mean making some changes to your treatment, perhaps by\u00a0adding an antidepressant or antipsychotic medicine to the mood-stabilising medication you're already taking. Your GP or specialist can advise you on this.\nPsychological treatment\nSome people find psychological treatment helpful when used alongside medication in between episodes of mania or depression. This may include:\n\npsychoeducation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to find out more about\u00a0bipolar disorder\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 this\u00a0is most useful when treating depression\nfamily therapy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a type of psychotherapy that focuses on family relationships (such as marriage) and encourages everyone within the family or relationship to work together\u00a0to improve mental health\n\nPsychological treatment usually consists of around 16 sessions. Each session lasts an hour and takes place over a period of six to nine months.\nPregnancy\nThe management of bipolar disorder in women who are pregnant, or those who are trying to conceive, is complex and challenging.\nOne of the main problems is the risks of taking medication during pregnancy aren't always that well understood.\nThe National Institute\u00a0for\u00a0Health and\u00a0Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that the risks of treating or not treating women with bipolar disorder during pregnancy should be fully discussed.\nNICE also recommends that specialist mental health services work closely with maternity services.\nA written plan for managing the treatment of a pregnant woman with bipolar disorder should be developed as soon as possible.\nThe plan should be drawn up with the patient, her partner, her obstetrician (pregnancy specialist), midwife, GP and health visitor.\nThe following medication isn't routinely prescribed for pregnant women with bipolar disorder:\n\nvalproate \u2013\u00a0there's a risk to the foetus and the subsequent development of the child\ncarbamazepine \u2013\u00a0it has limited effectiveness and there's risk of harm to the foetus\nlithium \u2013\u00a0there's a risk of harm to the foetus, such as cardiac problems\nlamotrigine \u2013\u00a0there's a risk of harm to the foetus\nparoxetine \u2013\u00a0there's a risk of harm to the foetus, such as cardiovascular malformations\nbenzodiazepines \u2013\u00a0if used long term, there are risks during the pregnancy and immediately after the birth, such as cleft palate and floppy baby syndrome\n\nIf you become pregnant while taking medication prescribed to treat bipolar disorder, it's important that you don't stop taking it until you've discussed it with your doctor.\nIf\u00a0medication is prescribed for bipolar disorder after the baby is born, it may also affect a mother's decision to breastfeed her child. Your pharmacist, midwife or mental health team can give you advice based on your circumstances.\n\n\nAlthough it's usually a long-term condition, effective treatments for bipolar disorder, combined with self-help techniques, can limit the condition's impact on your everyday life.\nStaying active and eating well\nEating well and keeping fit\u00a0are important for everyone.\u00a0Exercise can also help reduce the symptoms of bipolar disorder, particularly depressive symptoms.\nIt may also give you something to\u00a0focus on\u00a0and provide a\u00a0routine, which is important for many people.\nA healthy diet, combined with exercise, may also help limit weight gain, which is a common side effect of medical treatments for bipolar disorder.\nSome treatments also\u00a0increase the risk of developing diabetes, or worsen the illness in people that already have it. Maintaining a healthy weight and exercising are an important way of limiting that risk.\nYou should have a check-up at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes.\nThis will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure and having any appropriate blood tests.\nRead more information about\u00a0losing weight and improving fitness\nSelf-care and self-management\nSelf-care is an essential part of daily life.\u00a0It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from the people involved in your care.\nIt includes:\n\nstaying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health\npreventing illness or accidents\ncaring more effectively for minor ailments and long-term conditions\n\nPeople with\u00a0long-term conditions can benefit enormously from being helped\u00a0with self-care.\u00a0They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue, have a better quality of life, and be more active and independent.\nSelf-management programmes aim to help people with bipolar disorder take an active part in their own recovery so they're not controlled by their condition.\nOne course run by\u00a0Bipolar\u00a0UK aims to teach people with bipolar disorder how to manage their illness. The programme includes information about:\n\ntriggers and warning signs\ncoping strategies and self-medication\nsupport networks and action plans\nmaintaining a healthy lifestyle\ndrawing up an advance decision\ncomplementary therapies\naction plans\n\nThere are other courses, such as those run by Self Management UK, for mild to moderate mental health conditions.\nCourses\u00a0such as\u00a0these help people who may feel distressed and uncertain about their bipolar disorder improve their own lives.\nTalking about it\nSome people with bipolar disorder find it easy to talk to family and friends about their condition and its effects. Other people find it easier to turn to charities and support groups.\nMany organisations run self-help groups that can put you in touch with other people with the condition. This enables people to share helpful ideas and helps them\u00a0realise they're not alone in feeling the way they do. These organisations also provide online support in forums and blogs.\nSome useful charities, support groups and associations include:\n\nBipolar UK\nCarers UK\nMind\u00a0\nRethink\u00a0\nSamaritans\nSANE\u00a0\n\nTalking therapies\u00a0are useful for managing bipolar disorder, particularly during periods of stability.\nServices that can help\nYou may be involved with many different services during treatment for bipolar disorder. Some are accessed through referral from your GP, others through your local authority.\nThese services may include:\n\nCommunity mental health teams (CMHT) \u2013 these provide the main part of local specialist mental health services. They offer assessment, treatment and social care to people with\u00a0bipolar disorder\u00a0and other mental illnesses.\nEarly intervention teams\u00a0\u2013 these provide early identification and treatment for people who have the first symptoms of psychosis. Your GP may be able to refer you directly to an early intervention team.\nCrisis services \u2013 these allow people to be treated at home, instead of in hospital, for an acute episode. These are specialist mental health teams that deal with crises that occur outside normal office hours.\nAcute day hospital \u2013 these are an alternative to inpatient care in a hospital. You can visit every day or as often as you need.\nAssertive outreach teams \u2013 these deliver intensive treatment and rehabilitation in the community for people with severe mental health problems, providing rapid help in a crisis. Staff often visit people at home and liaise with other services, such as your GP or social services. They can also help with practical problems, such as helping to find housing and work, or doing your shopping and cooking.\n\nAvoiding drugs and alcohol\nSome people with bipolar disorder use alcohol or illegal drugs to try to take away their pain and distress. Both have well-known harmful physical and social effects and are not a substitute for effective treatment and good healthcare.\nSome people with bipolar disorder find they can stop misusing alcohol and drugs\u00a0once they're using effective treatment.\nOthers may have separate but related problems of alcohol and drug abuse, which may need to be treated separately.\nAvoiding alcohol and illegal drugs is an important part of recovery from episodes of manic, hypomanic or depressive symptoms, and can help you gain stability.\nRead more about\u00a0alcohol misuse\nMoney and benefits\nIt's important to avoid too much stress,\u00a0including work-related stress. If you're employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or in a more flexible way, particularly if job pressure triggers your symptoms.\nUnder the Equality Act 2010, people are protected from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. This can include people with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses.\nA\u00a0range of benefits\u00a0is available to people with bipolar disorder who\u00a0can't work as a result of their mental illness. The Adult Disability Payment is managed by Social Security Scotland.\u00a0Depending on your circumstances, you may qualify from\u00a0non-devolved\u00a0benefits from the UK Government.\nWant to know more?\n\nCare Information Scotland: Money\n\nLiving with or caring for someone with bipolar disorder\nPeople living with or caring for someone with bipolar disorder can have a tough time. During episodes of illness, the personalities of people with bipolar disorder may change, and they may become abusive or even violent.\nSometimes social workers and the police may become involved. Relationships and family life are likely to feel the strain.\nIf you're the Named Person (as defined by the\u00a0Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015) of a person with bipolar disorder, you have\u00a0certain rights that can be used to protect the person's interests.\nThese include requesting that the local social services authority asks an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with bipolar disorder should be detained in hospital (also known as \"sectioning\").\nYou may feel at a loss if you're caring for someone with bipolar disorder. Finding a support group and talking to other people\u00a0in a similar situation might help.\nIf you're having relationship or marriage difficulties, you can contact specialist relationship counsellors, who can talk things through with you and your partner.\n\nCare Information Scotland: Support for carers\nRelate: Relationship advice\n\nDealing with suicidal feelings\nHaving suicidal thoughts is a common depressive symptom of bipolar disorder.\u00a0Without treatment, these thoughts may get stronger.\nSome research has shown the risk of suicide for people with bipolar disorder is 15 to 20 times greater than the general population.\nStudies have also shown that as many as 25-50% of people with bipolar disorder attempt suicide at least once.\nThe risk of\u00a0suicide seems to be higher earlier in the illness, so early recognition and help may prevent it.\nIf you're feeling suicidal or you're having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or the local mental health emergency services as soon as possible.\nIf you can't or don't want to contact these people, contact the Samaritans on 116 123. You can call them\u00a024 hours a day, seven days a week.\u00a0\nAlternatively, visit the\u00a0Samaritans website\u00a0or email jo@samaritans.org.\nSelf-harm\nSelf-harm\u00a0(sometimes called self-injury) is often a symptom of mental health problems such as bipolar disorder.\nFor some people, self-harm is a way of gaining control over their lives or temporarily distracting themselves from mental distress. It may not be related to suicide or attempted suicide.\n\nMind: Understanding self-harm\nNational Self Harm Network\nRethink: Suicide and self-harm\nSamaritans\u00a0\n\nRecommended communities\nOnline communities help you talk to people, share your experiences and learn from others.\nThe SANE\u00a0Support Forum\u00a0allows people to share their feelings and provide mutual support to anyone with mental health issues, as well as their friends and family.\n\nSANE Support Forum\u00a0\n\nBipolar UK, a national charity, also\u00a0runs an online discussion forum for people with bipolar disorder, their families and carers.\n\nBipolar UK eCommunity\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Bladder cancer is where a growth of abnormal tissue, known as a tumour, develops in the bladder lining. In some cases, the tumour spreads into the surrounding muscles.\nThe most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in your urine, which is usually painless.\nIf you notice blood in your urine, even if it comes and goes, you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated.\nRead about the symptoms of bladder cancer\nTypes of bladder cancer\u00a0\nOnce diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has\u00a0spread.\u00a0\nIf the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\u00a0This is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 7 out of 10 cases.\u00a0Most people don't die as a result\u00a0of\u00a0this type of bladder cancer.\nWhen the cancerous cells spread beyond the lining, into the surrounding muscles of the bladder, it's referred to as muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\u00a0This is less common,\u00a0but has a higher chance\u00a0of spreading to other parts of the body and can be fatal.\nIf bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it's known as locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.\nRead more about diagnosing bladder cancer\nWhy does bladder cancer happen?\nMost cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder's cells over many years.\nTobacco smoke is a common cause and\u00a0it's estimated that half of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking.\nContact with certain chemicals previously\u00a0used in manufacturing is also known to cause bladder cancer. However, these substances have since\u00a0been banned.\nRead more about the causes of bladder cancer\u00a0and preventing bladder cancer\nTreating bladder cancer\nIn cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it's usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact.\nThis is done using a surgical technique called transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT).\u00a0This\u00a0is followed by a dose of chemotherapy medication directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\nIn cases with a higher risk of recurrence, a medication known as Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) may be\u00a0injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\nTreatment for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or muscle-invasive bladder cancer may involve surgically removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy.\nWhen the bladder is removed, you'll need another way of\u00a0collecting your urine. Possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external\u00a0bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. This will be done at the same time as a cystectomy.\nIf it's possible to avoid removing the bladder, or if surgery\u00a0is not suitable, a course of radiotherapy\u00a0and\u00a0chemotherapy may be recommended. Chemotherapy may sometimes be used on its own before surgery or before being combined with radiotherapy.\nAfter treatment for all types of bladder cancer, you'll have regular follow-up tests to check for signs of recurrence.\nRead more about treating bladder cancer\nWho is affected?\nBladder cancer\u00a0is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new\u00a0cases diagnosed in people\u00a0aged 75 and over.\nBladder cancer is also more common in men than in women, possibly because in the past, men were more likely to smoke and work in the\u00a0manufacturing industry.\n\n\nBlood in your urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer.\nThe medical name for this is haematuria\u00a0and it's usually painless. You may notice streaks of blood in your urine or the blood may turn your urine brown. The blood isn't always noticeable and it may come and go.\nLess common symptoms of bladder cancer include:\n\na need to urinate on a more frequent basis\nsudden urges to urinate\na burning sensation when passing urine\n\nIf bladder cancer reaches an advanced stage and begins to spread, symptoms can include:\n\npelvic pain\u00a0\nbone pain\nunintentional weight loss\u00a0\nswelling of the legs\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you ever have blood in your urine\u00a0\u2013 even if it comes and goes\u00a0\u2013 you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated.\nHaving blood in your urine doesn't mean you definitely have bladder cancer. There are other, more common, causes including:\n\na\u00a0urinary tract infection,\u00a0such as cystitis\na kidney infection\nkidney stones\nurethritis\nan enlarged prostate gland,\u00a0in men\n\n\n\nBladder cancer is caused by changes to the cells of the bladder. It's often linked with exposure to certain chemicals, but the cause isn't always known.\nWhat is cancer?\nCancer begins with a change (mutation)\u00a0in the structure of the DNA in cells, which\u00a0can\u00a0affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nIncreased risk\nSeveral\u00a0factors\u00a0have been identified that can significantly increase your risk of developing bladder cancer.\nSmoking is the single biggest risk factor for bladder cancer. This is because tobacco contains cancer-causing (carcinogenic) chemicals.\nIf you smoke for many years, these chemicals pass into your bloodstream and are filtered by the kidneys\u00a0into your urine. The bladder is repeatedly exposed to these harmful chemicals, as it acts as a store for urine. This can cause changes to the cells of the bladder lining, which may\u00a0lead to bladder cancer.\nIt's estimated that\u00a0just over a third\u00a0of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by\u00a0smoking. People who smoke may be up to\u00a0four times more likely to develop bladder cancer than non-smokers.\nExposure to certain industrial chemicals is the second biggest risk factor. Previous studies have estimated that this may account for around 25% of cases.\nChemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer include:\n\naniline dyes\n2-Naphthylamine\n4-Aminobiphenyl\nxenylamine\nbenzidine\no-toluidine\n\nOccupations\u00a0linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving:\n\ndyes\ntextiles\nrubbers\npaints\nplastics\nleather tanning\n\nSome non-manufacturing jobs have also been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer. These include taxi or bus drivers, as a result of their regular exposure to the chemicals present in diesel fumes.\nThe link between bladder cancer and these types of occupations was discovered in the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, regulations relating to exposure to cancer-causing chemicals have been made much more rigorous and many of the chemicals listed above\u00a0have been banned.\nHowever,\u00a0these chemicals are still\u00a0linked with cases of bladder cancer now, as it can take up to\u00a030 years after initial exposure to the chemicals before the condition starts to develop.\nOther\u00a0factors that can increase your risk of bladder cancer include:\n\nradiotherapy to treat previous cancers near the bladder, such as\u00a0bowel cancer\nprevious treatment with\u00a0certain chemotherapy medications, such as\u00a0cyclophosphamide and cisplatin\nprevious surgery to remove part of the prostate gland, during treatment for\u00a0benign prostate enlargement\nhaving diabetes \u2013 bladder cancer is thought to be linked to certain treatments for type 2 diabetes\nhaving a tube in your bladder (an indwelling catheter) for a long time, because you have nerve damage that has resulted in paralysis\nlong-term or repeated\u00a0urinary tract infections (UTIs)\nlong-term bladder stones\nhaving an early\u00a0menopause (before the age of 42)\nan untreated infection called schistosomiasis, which is\u00a0caused by a parasite that\u00a0lives in fresh water\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this is very rare in the UK\n\nHow does bladder cancer spread?\nBladder cancer usually begins in the cells of the bladder lining. In some cases, it\u00a0may spread into surrounding bladder muscle. If the cancer penetrates this muscle, it\u00a0can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system.\nIf bladder cancer spreads to other parts of the body, such as other organs, it's known as metastatic bladder cancer.\n\n\nIf you have symptoms of bladder cancer, such as blood in your urine, you should speak to your GP.\nYour GP may ask about your\u00a0symptoms,\u00a0family history and whether you've been exposed to any possible causes of bladder cancer,\u00a0such as\u00a0smoking.\nIn some cases, your GP may request a urine sample, so\u00a0it can be tested in a laboratory for traces of blood, bacteria or abnormal cells.\nYour GP\u00a0may also carry out a physical examination of your rectum and vagina,\u00a0as bladder cancer\u00a0sometimes causes a noticeable lump that presses against them.\nIf your doctor suspects\u00a0bladder cancer,\u00a0you'll be\u00a0referred to a hospital for further tests.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\u00a0Find out who should be referred for further tests for suspected bladder cancer.\nAt the\u00a0hospital\nSome hospitals have\u00a0specialist clinics for people with\u00a0blood in their urine (haematuria), while others have specialist urology departments for people with urinary tract problems.\nIf you're referred to a hospital specialist and they think you might have bladder cancer, you should first be offered a cystoscopy.\nThis procedure allows the specialist to examine the inside of your bladder by passing a cystoscope through your urethra (the tube through which you urinate).\u00a0A cystoscope is\u00a0a\u00a0thin tube with a camera and light at the end.\nBefore having a cystoscopy,\u00a0a\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0gel is applied to your urethra (the tube through which you urinate) so\u00a0you don't feel any pain.\u00a0The gel also\u00a0helps the cystoscope to pass into the urethra more easily.\nThe procedure usually takes about 5 minutes.\nYou may be offered a\u00a0CT scan\u00a0or an\u00a0MRI scan if the specialist feels they need a more detailed picture of your bladder.\nAn intravenous (IV) urogram may also be used to look at your whole urinary system before or after treatment for bladder cancer.\nDuring this procedure, dye is injected into your bloodstream and X-rays are used to study it as it passes through your urinary system.\nIf abnormalities are found in your bladder during a cystoscopy, you should be offered an operation known as TURBT. This is\u00a0so any abnormal areas of tissue\u00a0can be removed and tested for cancer (a biopsy).\nTURBT\u00a0is carried out under\u00a0general anaesthetic.\nSometimes, a sample of the muscle wall of your bladder is also taken to check whether the cancer has spread, but this may be a separate operation within 6 weeks of the first\u00a0biopsy.\nYou should also be offered a dose of\u00a0chemotherapy after the operation. This may help to prevent the bladder cancer returning if the removed cells are found to be cancerous.\nSee\u00a0treating bladder cancer for more information about the TURBT procedure\nStaging and grading\nOnce these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you the grade of the cancer and what stage it is.\nStaging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. Lower-stage cancers are smaller and have a better chance of successful treatment.\nGrading is a measurement of how likely a cancer is to spread.\u00a0The grade of a cancer is usually described using a number system ranging from G1 to G3. High-grade cancers are more likely to spread than low-grade cancers.\u00a0\nThe most widely used staging system for bladder cancer is known as the TNM system, where:\n\nT stands for how\u00a0far into the bladder the tumour has grown\nN stands for whether the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes\nM stands for whether the cancer has spread into another part of the body (metastasis), such as the lungs\n\nThe T staging system is as follows:\n\nTIS or CIS (carcinoma in situ) \u2013 a very early high-grade cancer confined to the innermost layer of the bladder lining\nTa \u2013 the cancer is just in the innermost layer of the bladder lining\nT1 \u2013 the cancerous cells have started to grow into the connective tissue beyond the bladder lining\n\nBladder cancer up to the T1 stage is usually called early bladder cancer or non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\nIf the tumour grows larger than this, it's usually called muscle-invasive bladder cancer and is categorised as:\n\nT2 \u2013 the cancer has grown through the connective tissue, into the bladder muscle\nT3 \u2013 the cancer has grown through the layer of muscles, into the surrounding layer of fat\n\nIf the tumour grows larger than the T3 stage, it's considered to be advanced bladder cancer and is categorised as:\n\nT4 \u2013 the cancer has spread outside the bladder, into surrounding organs\n\nThe N staging system is as follows:\n\nN0 \u2013 there are no cancerous cells in any of your lymph nodes\nN1 \u2013 there are cancerous cells in just one of your lymph nodes in your pelvis\nN2 \u2013 there are cancerous cells in two or more lymph nodes in your pelvis\nN3 \u2013 there are cancerous cells in one or more of your lymph nodes (known as common iliac nodes) deep in your groin\n\nThere are only two options in the M system:\n\nM0 \u2013 where the cancer hasn't spread to another part of the body\nM1 \u2013 where the cancer has spread to another part of the body, such as the bones, lungs or liver\n\nThe TNM system can be difficult to understand, so don't be afraid to ask your care team questions about your test results and what they mean for your treatment and outlook.\n\n\nThe treatment options for bladder cancer largely depend on how advanced the cancer is.\nTreatments usually differ\u00a0between early stage, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and more advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\nMultidisciplinary teams (MDTs)\nAll hospitals use MDTs to treat bladder cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nMembers of your MDT may include:\n\na urologist\u00a0\u2013 a surgeon specialising in treating conditions affecting the urinary tract\na clinical oncologist\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in chemotherapy and radiotherapy\na pathologist\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a specialist in diseased tissue\na radiologist\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in detecting disease using imaging techniques\n\nYou should be given the contact details for a clinical nurse specialist, who will be in contact with all members of your MDT.\u00a0They'll be able to answer questions and support you throughout your treatment.\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your MDT will make recommendations, but remember that the final decision is yours.\u00a0\nBefore discussing your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask your MDT.\nNon-muscle-invasive bladder cancer\nIf you've been diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stages CIS, Ta and T1), your recommended treatment plan depends on the risk of the cancer returning or spreading beyond the lining of your bladder.\nThis risk is calculated using a series of factors, including:\n\nthe number of tumours present in your bladder\nwhether the tumours are larger than 3cm (1 inch) in diameter\nwhether you've had bladder cancer before\nthe grade of the cancer cells\n\nThese treatments are discussed in more detail below.\nLow-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is treated with transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This procedure may be performed during your first cystoscopy when tissue samples are taken for testing (see diagnosing bladder cancer).\nTURBT is carried out under general anaesthetic. The surgeon uses an instrument called a cystoscope to locate the visible tumours and cut them away from the lining of the bladder. The wounds are sealed (cauterised) using a mild electric current, and you may be given a\u00a0catheter to drain any blood or debris from your bladder over the next few days.\nAfter surgery,\u00a0you may be given a\u00a0single dose of\u00a0chemotherapy, directly into your bladder,\u00a0using a catheter. The solution is kept in your bladder for around an hour before being drained away.\nMost people are able to leave hospital less than 48 hours after having TURBT and are able to resume normal physical activity within 2 weeks.\nYou should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months and nine months to check your bladder, using a cystoscopy. If your cancer returns after 6 months and is small,\u00a0you may be offered a treatment called fulguration. This involves using an electric current to destroy the cancer cells.\nPeople with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a course of at least 6 doses of chemotherapy. The liquid is placed directly into your bladder,\u00a0using a catheter, and kept there for around an hour before being drained away.\nYou should be offered follow-up appointments at 3 months, 9 months, 18 months, then once every year.\u00a0At\u00a0these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.\u00a0If your cancer returns within 5 years, you'll be referred back to a specialist urology team.\nSome residue of the chemotherapy medication may be left in your urine after treatment, which could severely irritate your skin. It helps\u00a0if you urinate while sitting down and that you're careful not to splash yourself or the toilet seat. After passing urine, wash the skin around your genitals with soap and water.\nIf you're sexually active, it's important to use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom. This is\u00a0because the medication may be present in your semen or vaginal fluids, which can cause irritation.\nYou also shouldn't try to get pregnant or father a child while having chemotherapy for bladder cancer, as the medication can increase the risk of having a child with birth defects.\nPeople with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a second TURBT operation, within 6 weeks of the initial investigation\u00a0(see diagnosing bladder cancer). A CT scan\u00a0or an\u00a0MRI scan may also be required.\nYour urologist and clinical nurse specialist\u00a0will discuss\u00a0your treatment options with you, which will either be:\n\na course of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) treatment \u2013 using a variant of the\u00a0BCG vaccine\nan operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy)\n\nThe BCG vaccine is passed into your bladder through a catheter and left for 2 hours before being drained away. Most people require weekly treatments over a 6-week period. Common side effects of\u00a0BCG include:\n\na frequent need to urinate\npain when urinating\nblood in your urine (haematuria)\nflu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, fever and aching\nurinary tract infections\n\nIf\u00a0BCG\u00a0treatment doesn't work, or the side effects are too strong, you'll be referred back to a specialist urology team.\nYou should be offered follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, then once a year.\u00a0At\u00a0these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.\nIf you decide to have a cystectomy, your surgeon will\u00a0need to\u00a0create an alternative way for urine to leave your body (urinary diversion). Your clinical nurse specialist can discuss your options for the procedure and how the urinary diversion will be created.\nRead about the\u00a0complications of bladder cancer surgery\u00a0for more information about urinary diversion and sexual problems after surgery.\nAfter having a cystectomy,\u00a0you should be offered follow-up appointments including a CT scan at six and 12 months, and\u00a0blood tests once a year. Men require an appointment to check their urethra once a year for 5 years.\nMuscle-invasive bladder cancer\nThe recommended treatment plan for muscle-invasive bladder cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. With T2 and\u00a0T3 bladder cancer, treatment aims to cure the condition if possible, or at least control it for a long time.\nYour urologist, oncologist and clinical nurse specialist\u00a0will discuss\u00a0your treatment options with you, which will either be:\n\nan operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy) \u2013 see above\nradiotherapy with a radiosensitiser\n\nYour oncologist\u00a0should also discuss the possibility of having chemotherapy before either\u00a0of these treatments (neoadjuvant therapy), if it's suitable for you.\nRadiotherapy is given by a machine that beams the radiation at the bladder (external radiotherapy). Sessions are usually given on a daily basis for 5 days a week over the course of 4 to 7 weeks. Each session lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes.\nA radiosensitiser\u00a0should also be given alongside radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is a medicine which affects the cells of a tumour, to enhance the effect of radiotherapy. It has a much smaller effect on normal tissue.\nAs well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells, which means it can cause a number of side effects. These include:\n\ndiarrhoea \ninflammation of the bladder (cystitis)\ntightening of the vagina (in women), which can make having sex painful\nerectile dysfunction (in men)\nloss of pubic hair\ninfertility\ntiredness\ndifficulty passing urine\n\nMost of these side effects should pass a few weeks after your treatment finishes, although there's a chance they'll be permanent.\nHaving radiation directed at your pelvis usually means you'll be infertile for the rest of your life.\u00a0However, most people treated for bladder cancer are too old to have children, so this isn't usually a problem.\nAfter having radiotherapy for bladder cancer,\u00a0you should be offered follow-up appointments\u00a0every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and every year after that.\u00a0At\u00a0these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.\u00a0\nYou may also be offered CT scans of your abdomen, pelvis and chest after 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. A CT scan of your urinary tract may be offered every year for 5 years.\nYour MDT may recommend a specific treatment\u00a0because of\u00a0your individual circumstances.\nFor example, someone with a small bladder or\u00a0many existing urinary symptoms is better suited to surgery. Someone who has a single bladder tumour with normal bladder function is better suited for treatments that preserve the bladder.\nHowever, your input is also important, so you should discuss which treatment is best for you with your MDT.\nThere are pros and cons of both surgery and radiotherapy.\nThe pros of having a radical cystectomy include:\n\ntreatment is carried out in one go\nyou won't need regular cystoscopies after treatment, although other less invasive tests\u00a0may be needed\n\nThe cons of having a radical cystectomy include:\n\nit can take up to 3 months to fully recover\na risk of general surgical complications, such as pain, infection and bleeding\na risk of complications from the use of\u00a0general anaesthetic\nan alternative way of passing urine out of your body needs to be created, which may involve an external bag\na high risk of erectile dysfunction in men (estimated at around 90%)\u00a0as a result of nerve damage\nafter surgery, some women may find sex uncomfortable, as their vagina may be smaller\na small chance of a fatal complication, such as a heart attack,\u00a0stroke or\u00a0deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n\nThe pros of having radiotherapy include:\n\nthere's no need to have surgery, which is often an important consideration for people in poor health\nyour bladder function may not be affected, as your bladder isn't removed\nthere's less chance of causing erectile dysfunction (around 30%)\n\nThe cons of having radiotherapy include:\n\nyou'll require regular sessions of radiotherapy for 4 to 7 weeks\nshort-term side effects are common,\u00a0such as diarrhoea, tiredness and inflammation of the bladder (cystitis)\na small chance\u00a0of permanently damaging the bladder, which could lead to problems urinating\nwomen may experience a narrowed vagina, making sex difficult and uncomfortable\n\nIn some cases,\u00a0chemotherapy may be used during treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Instead of medication being put directly into your bladder, it's put into a vein in your arm. This is called intravenous chemotherapy and can be used:\n\nbefore radiotherapy and surgery to shrink the size of any tumours\nin combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation)\nto slow the spread of incurable advanced bladder cancer (palliative chemotherapy)\n\nThere isn't enough evidence to say whether chemotherapy is an effective treatment when it's given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning. It's usually only used this way as part of a clinical trial.\u00a0See clinical trials for bladder cancer\u00a0for more information.\nChemotherapy is usually given over a few consecutive days at first. You'll then have a few weeks off to allow your body to recover before the treatment begins again. This cycle will be repeated for a few months.\nAs the chemotherapy medication is being injected into your blood, you'll experience a wider range of side effects than if you were having chemotherapy directly into the bladder. These side effects should stop after the treatment has finished.\nChemotherapy weakens your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It's important to report any symptoms of a potential infection, such as a high temperature, persistent cough or reddening of the skin, to your MDT. Avoid close contact with people who are known to have an infection.\nOther\u00a0side effects of chemotherapy can include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\nhair loss\nlack of appetite\ntiredness\n\nLocally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer\nThe recommended treatment plan for\u00a0locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer\u00a0depends on how far the cancer has spread. Your oncologist should discuss your treatment options with you, which may include:\n\na course of chemotherapy\ntreatments to relieve cancer symptoms\n\nIf you receive a course of chemotherapy, you'll be given a combination of drugs to help relieve the side effects of treatment. Treatment may be stopped if chemotherapy isn't helping, or a second course may be offered.\nYou may be offered treatment to relieve any cancer symptoms. This may include:\n\nradiotherapy to treat painful urination, blood in urine, frequently needing to urinate or pain in your pelvic area\ntreatment to drain your kidneys, if they become blocked and cause lower back pain\n\nPalliative care\nIf your cancer is at an advanced stage and can't be cured, your MDT should discuss how the cancer will progress and which treatments are available to ease the symptoms.\u00a0\nYou can be referred to a palliative care team, who can provide support and practical help, including pain relief.\nRead more about end of life care\n\n\nA diagnosis of bladder cancer, and some treatments for the condition, can have a significant impact on your life.\nEmotional impact\nThe emotional impact of living with bladder cancer can be huge. Many people report experiencing a kind of 'rollercoaster' effect. For example, you may feel down at receiving a diagnosis,\u00a0up when\u00a0the cancer\u00a0is removed, and down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of your treatment.\nThis type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger feelings of depression. Signs that you may be depressed include:\n\nhaving continuous feelings\u00a0of sadness\u00a0or hopelessness\nno longer taking pleasure in the things you enjoy\n\nContact your GP for advice if you think you may be depressed. There's a range of relatively successful treatments for depression, including antidepressant medication and\u00a0therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nRead more about\u00a0coping with cancer\nUrinary diversion\nIf\u00a0your bladder is removed, an alternative way of passing urine out of your\u00a0body will be created during the operation. This is called urinary diversion.\nThere are various types of urinary diversion, which are described below. In some cases, you may be able to make a choice based on your personal preferences. However, certain treatment options will not be suitable for everyone.\nYour multidisciplinary team (MDT) can provide information on the most suitable options for you.\nA urostomy is\u00a0carried out during a radical cystectomy. A small section of\u00a0the small bowel is\u00a0removed and\u00a0connected to your ureters (the 2 tubes that normally carry urine out of the kidneys).\nThe surgeon\u00a0then creates a small hole in the surface of your abdomen and the open end of the removed bowel is placed in this hole, creating an opening known as a stoma.\nA\u00a0special waterproof\u00a0bag\u00a0is placed over the stoma to collect urine. A\u00a0stoma nurse will teach you how to care for your stoma, and how and when to change the bag.\nContinent urinary diversion is similar to a urostomy, but\u00a0without an external bag. Instead, a section of your bowel\u00a0is used to create a pouch inside your body that stores urine.\nThe ureters are connected to the pouch and the pouch is connected to an opening in the abdominal wall.\u00a0A valve in the opening (stoma) prevents urine leaking out.\nThe pouch is emptied using a\u00a0thin, flexible tube\u00a0(catheter). Most people need to empty their pouch about 4 or 5 times a day.\nIn some cases it may be possible to create a new bladder, known as a neobladder. This involves removing a section of your bowel and reconstructing it into a balloon-like sac, before connecting it to your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) at one end and your ureters at the other end. However, bladder reconstruction isn't suitable for everyone.\u00a0\nYou'll be taught how to empty your neobladder by relaxing the muscles in your pelvis, while\u00a0tightening the muscles in your abdomen at the same time.\nYour neobladder won't contain the same types of nerve endings as a real bladder, so you won't get the distinctive sensation that tells you to pass urine. Some people experience a feeling of fullness inside their abdomen, while others have reported they feel like they need to pass wind.\nBecause of\u00a0the loss of normal nerve function, most people with a neobladder experience some episodes of\u00a0urinary incontinence, which usually occurs during the night, while they're asleep.\nYou may find it useful to empty your neobladder at set times during the day, including before you go to bed, to help prevent incontinence.\nGuy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust has more information and advice about\u00a0treatments for bladder cancer.\nSexual problems\nContact your\u00a0MDT if you lose the ability to obtain or maintain an erection after a radical cystectomy. It may be possible for you to be treated with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5). PDE5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis.\nPDE5s are sometimes combined with\u00a0a device called a vacuum pump, which consists of a\u00a0cylinder connected to a pump. The penis is placed inside the cylinder and the air is pumped out. This creates a vacuum that causes blood to\u00a0flow into the penis. A rubber ring is then placed around the base of the penis, which allows an erection to be maintained for around 30 minutes.\nRead more about treating erectile dysfunction\nBoth radiotherapy and cystectomy can cause a woman's vagina to become shortened and narrowed, which can make penetrative sex painful or difficult.\nThere are 2 main treatment options available if you have a narrowed vagina. The first is to apply hormonal cream to the area, which should help to increase moisture inside your vagina.\nThe second is to use vaginal dilators. These are\u00a0plastic cone-shaped devices of various sizes\u00a0that are designed to gently stretch\u00a0your vagina and make it more supple.\nIt's usually recommended that you\u00a0use\u00a0dilators\u00a0for a 5 to\u00a010-minute period every day, starting with the dilator that fits in easiest first and\u00a0gradually increasing the size, as your vagina stretches over the following weeks.\nMany women find this an embarrassing issue to discuss, but the use of dilators is a well-recognised treatment for narrowing of the vagina. Your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide more information and advice.\nYou may find that the\u00a0more often you have penetrative sex, the less painful it becomes. However, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner.\nThe Macmillan Cancer Support website has information and a video about cancer and sexuality\n\n\nIt's not always possible to prevent bladder cancer, but some risk factors have been identified, which may increase your risk of developing the condition.\nStopping smoking\nIf you smoke, giving up is the best way to reduce your risk of developing bladder cancer and preventing it from recurring.\nIf you decide to stop smoking, you\u00a0could contact the Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0service on\u00a00800 84 84 84\u00a0(8.00am to 10.00pm, every day). The specially trained helpline staff will\u00a0offer you free expert advice and encouragement.\nIf you're committed to giving up smoking, but\u00a0don't want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may experience after giving up.\nFor more information and advice about giving up smoking, have a browse through\u00a0stop smoking treatments and the stop smoking home page.\nWorkplace safety\nYour risk of bladder cancer could be increased if your job involves exposure to certain chemicals. Occupations linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving:\n\nrubber\ndyes\ntextiles\nplastic\nleather tanning\ndiesel fumes\n\nNowadays, there are rigorous safety protocols in place designed to minimise your risk of exposure, and\u00a0chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer have been banned. If you're uncertain about what these protocols involve, talk to your line manager or health and safety representative.\nIf you're concerned that your employer may be disregarding recommendations about workplace safety, you should contact the Health and Safety Executive for advice.\nDiet\nThere's some evidence to suggest that a diet high in fruit and vegetables and low in fat can help to prevent bladder cancer.\nEven though this evidence is limited, it's a good idea to follow this type of healthy diet, as it can help to prevent other types of cancer, such as bowel cancer, as well as serious health conditions, including\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension), stroke and heart disease.\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains. Limit the amount of salt you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day (1 teaspoon) because too much can increase your blood pressure.\nYou should try to avoid foods that contain saturated fat, as it\u00a0can increase your cholesterol levels.\nFoods high in saturated fat include:\n\nmeat pies\nsausages and fatty cuts of meat\nbutter\nghee (a type of butter often used in Indian cooking)\nlard\ncream\nhard cheese\ncakes and biscuits\nfoods that contain coconut or palm oil\n\nHowever, a balanced diet should include a small amount of unsaturated fat, because\u00a0this will actually help to control your cholesterol levels.\nFoods\u00a0high in unsaturated fat include:\n\noily fish\navocados\nnuts and seeds\nsunflower, rapeseed, olive and vegetable oils\n\nRead more about\u00a0healthy eating\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "What is sepsis?\nSepsis is a rare but serious complication of an infection.\nWithout quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death.\nWhat causes a sepsis infection?\nThe immune system usually keeps an infection limited to one place. This is called a localised infection. To do this, the body produces white blood cells.\nWhite blood cells travel to an infection site to destroy the germs causing the infection. This triggers tissue swelling, known as inflammation. This helps to fight the infection and prevent it from spreading.\nHowever, an infection can spread to other parts of the body if the immune system is weak or an infection is severe.\nWidespread inflammation can damage tissue and interfere with blood flow. When blood flow is interrupted, blood pressure can drop dangerously low. This stops oxygen from reaching the organs and tissues.\nSources of infection\nSepsis can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body. The most common sites of infection that lead to sepsis are the:\n\nlungs\nurinary tract\ntummy (abdomen)\npelvis\n\nHowever, sometimes the specific infection and source of sepsis can't be identified.\nTests to diagnose sepsis\nSepsis is often diagnosed by testing your:\n\ntemperature\nheart rate\nbreathing rate\nblood\n\nOther tests can help determine the type of infection, where it's located and which parts of the body have been affected. These include:\n\nurine or stool samples\na wound culture \u2013 where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing\nrespiratory secretion testing \u2013 taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus\nblood pressure tests\nimaging studies \u2013 like an X-ray, ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT) scan\n\nWho\u2019s at risk of sepsis?\nAnyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection. However, some people are more vulnerable, including people who:\n\nare very young\nare very old\nare pregnant\nhave had a urinary catheter fitted\nhave a long term health condition like diabetes\nhave recently had surgery\nare genetically prone to infections\nare already in hospital with a serious illness\nhave to stay in hospital for a long time\nhave wounds or injuries as a result of an accident\nhave a medical condition that weakens the immune system \u2013 like HIV or leukaemia\nare receiving medical treatment that weakens the immune system \u2013 like chemotherapy or long-term steroids\nare on mechanical ventilation \u2013 where a machine is used to help you breathe\n\nRecovering from sepsis\nSome people make a full recovery from sepsis fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies depending on:\n\nthe severity of the sepsis\nthe person's overall health\nhow much time was spent in hospital\nwhether treatment was needed in an intensive care unit (ICU)\n\nLong term effects of sepsis\nSome people with sepsis will experience long-term physical and psychological problems. This is known as post-sepsis syndrome.\nSymptoms of post-sepsis syndrome include:\n\nfeeling lethargic or excessively tired\nmuscle weakness\nswollen limbs\njoint pain\nchest pain\nbreathlessness\n\n\n\nSepsis can cause a variety of symptoms.\nSepsis symptoms in children under 5\n\nover 38C (babies under 3 months)\nover 39C (babies aged 3 to 6 months)\nbelow 36C \u2013 check 3 times in a 10-minute period\na high temperature in a child who can\u2019t be encouraged to show interest in anything\n\n\ndifficulty breathing \u2013 this looks like hard work\ngrunting with every breath\nstruggling to speak more than a few words at once (for older children who normally talk)\nbreathing that obviously \"pauses\"\n\n\nno interest in feeding (child under 1 month)\nnot drinking for more than 8 hours (when awake)\nblack, green or bloody vomit\n\n\na soft spot on a baby's head that bulges\n\u201csunken\u201d eyes\na baby that\u2019s floppy\na child that can\u2019t be encouraged to show interest in anything\nweak, whining or continuous crying in a younger child\nconfusion in an older child\nirritableness\nunresponsive\nstiffness in the neck, especially when trying to look up or down\nnot had a wee or wet nappy for 12 hours\n\nSepsis symptoms in older children and adults\nEarly symptoms of sepsis may include:\n\na high temperature (fever) or low body temperature\nchills and shivering\na fast heartbeat\nfast breathing\n\nSymptoms of severe sepsis or septic shock\nIn some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock\u00a0(when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop.\nThese can include:\n\nfeeling dizzy or faint\na change in mental state \u2013 like confusion or disorientation\ndiarrhoea\nnausea and vomiting\nslurred speech\nsevere muscle pain\nsevere breathlessness\nless urine production than normal \u2013 for example, not urinating for a day\ncold, clammy and pale or mottled skin\nloss of consciousness\n\n\n\nTreatment for sepsis varies, depending on the:\n\narea affected\ncause of the infection\norgans affected\nextent of any damage\n\nIf you have the early signs of sepsis, you'll usually be referred to hospital. You'll then be given a diagnosis and treatment.\nEmergency treatment\nYou'll need emergency treatment, or treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), if:\n\nthe sepsis is severe\nyou develop septic shock\u00a0\u2013 when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level\n\nICUs can support body functions like breathing that are affected by sepsis. This allows the medical staff to focus on treating the infection.\nSepsis is treatable if it's identified and treated quickly. In most cases it leads to full recovery with no lasting problems.\nAntibiotics\nThe main treatment for sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock is antibiotics. These will be given directly into a vein (intravenously).\nIdeally, antibiotic treatment should start within an hour of diagnosis.\nIntravenous antibiotics are usually replaced by tablets after 2 to 4 days. You may have to take them for 7 to 10 days or longer, depending on the severity of your condition.\nIf sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics are given first. This is because there won't be time to wait until a specific type of infection has been identified.\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics work against a wide range of known infectious bacteria. They usually cure most common infections.\nOnce a specific bacterium has been identified, a more focused antibiotic can be used.\nViral infections\nIf the sepsis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won't work. However, it would be too dangerous to delay treatment to find out the specific cause. This means antibiotics are usually given anyway.\nWith a viral infection, you'll need to wait until your immune system starts to tackle it. However, antiviral medication may be given in some cases.\nIntravenous fluids\nIf you have sepsis, your body needs more fluid to prevent dehydration and kidney failure.\nIf you have severe sepsis or septic shock, you'll usually be given fluids intravenously for the first 24 to 48 hours.\nIt's important that the doctors know how much urine your kidneys are making when you have sepsis. This helps them spot signs of kidney failure.\nIf you're admitted with severe sepsis or septic shock, you'll usually be given a catheter. This is inserted into your bladder to monitor your urine output.\nOxygen\nYour body's oxygen demand goes up if you have sepsis.\nIf you're admitted to hospital with sepsis and the level of oxygen in your blood is low, you'll usually be given oxygen. This is given through a mask or tubes in your nostrils.\nTreating the source of infection\nIf a source of the infection can be identified, like an abscess or infected wound, this will also need to be treated.\nFor example, any pus may need to be drained away. In more serious cases, surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair any damage.\nIncreasing blood pressure\nMedications called vasopressors are used if you have low blood pressure caused by sepsis.\nVasopressors are normally given intravenously while you're in an ICU. Extra fluids may also be given intravenously to help increase blood pressure.\nOther treatments\nYou may require additional treatments like:\n\ncorticosteroids\ninsulin medication\na blood transfusion\nmechanical ventilation \u2013 where a machine is used to help you breathe\ndialysis \u2013 where a machine filters your blood to copy the function of your kidneys\n\nThese treatments are mostly used in ICUs.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones.\u00a0\nThis is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body.\nThese pages only refer to primary bone cancer.

The treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have.\nWhat causes bone cancer?\nIn most cases, it's not known why a person develops bone cancer.\nYou're more at risk\u00a0of developing it if you:\n\nhave had previous exposure to\u00a0radiation\u00a0during\u00a0radiotherapy\nhave a condition known as Paget's disease of the bone\u00a0\u2013 however, only a very small number of people with Paget\u2019s disease will actually develop bone cancer\nhave a rare genetic condition called\u00a0Li-Fraumeni syndrome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cells\n\nRead more about the causes of bone cancer\nHow bone cancer is treated\nTreatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.\nMost people have a combination of:\n\nsurgery to remove the section of cancerous bone \u2013 it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed,\u00a0but\u00a0amputation\u00a0is sometimes necessary\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0treatment\u00a0with powerful cancer-killing medication\nradiotherapy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where\u00a0radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells\n\nIn some cases of\u00a0osteosarcoma,\u00a0a medication called mifamurtide may also\u00a0be recommended.\nRead more about treating bone cancer\nOutlook\nThe outlook for bone cancer depends on\u00a0factors such as\u00a0your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade).\nGenerally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn't spread.\nFor more detailed statistics broken down by the different types of bone cancer, see the\u00a0page on statistics and outlook for bone cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.\n\n\nBone pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. Some people experience other symptoms as well.\nBone pain\nPain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. This\u00a0gradually progresses to a persistent ache or ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting.\nAny bone can be affected, although bone cancer most often develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.\nThe\u00a0pain can sometimes be\u00a0wrongly mistaken for\u00a0arthritis in adults and growing pains\u00a0in children and teenagers.\nOther symptoms\nSome people\u00a0also experience swelling and redness (inflammation) or\u00a0notice a lump on or around the affected bone. If the bone is near a joint, the swelling may make it difficult to use the joint.\nIn some cases, the cancer can weaken a bone, causing it to break (fracture) easily\u00a0after a minor injury or fall.\nLess common symptoms can include:\n\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\nunexplained weight loss\nsweating, particularly\u00a0at night\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSpeak to your GP if you or your child experiences persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, or if you're worried about any symptoms.\nWhile it's highly unlikely that your symptoms are caused by cancer, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nRead more about diagnosing bone cancer\n\n\nCancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nThe exact reason why this happens is often not known, but certain things can increase your chance of developing the condition, including:\n\nprevious\u00a0radiotherapy treatment\nother\u00a0bone conditions, such as Paget's disease of the bone\nrare genetic conditions, such as\u00a0Li-Fraumeni syndrome\na history of\u00a0certain\u00a0other\u00a0conditions, including retinoblastoma\u00a0and umbilical hernia\n\nRadiotherapy treatment\nPrevious exposure to high doses of radiation\u00a0during radiotherapy\u00a0may cause cancerous changes in your bone cells at a later stage, although this risk is thought to be small.\nBone conditions\nSome non-cancerous (benign) conditions affecting the bones may increase your chances of developing bone cancer, although the risk is still small.\nIn particular, a condition called Paget\u2019s disease of the bone\u00a0can increase the risk of bone cancer in people over 50\u00a0to 60 years of age.\nRarer conditions that cause tumours to grow in your bones, such as Ollier's disease, can also increase your risk of bone cancer.\nGenetic conditions\nA rare genetic condition called\u00a0Li-Fraumeni syndrome can increase your risk of developing bone cancer, as well as several other types of cancer.\nPeople with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that usually helps stop the growth of tumours in the body.\nOther conditions\nPeople who had a rare type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma\u00a0as a child may be more likely to develop bone cancer, because the same inherited faulty gene can be responsible for both conditions.\nResearch has also found that babies born with an umbilical hernia\u00a0are three times more likely to develop a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma,\u00a0although the risk is still\u00a0very small.\n\n\nIf you're experiencing bone pain, your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area, before deciding whether you need to have any further tests.\nThey will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have\u00a0problems moving the affected area. They may ask about the type of pain you experience \u2013 whether it's constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse.\nAfter being examined, you may be\u00a0referred for an X-ray of the affected area to look for any problems in the bones. If the X-ray shows abnormal areas, you'll be referred to\u00a0an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone conditions) or bone cancer specialist\u00a0for a further assessment.\nX-rays\nAn X-ray\u00a0is a procedure where radiation is used to\u00a0produce images of the inside of the body. It's a particularly effective way of looking at bones.\nX-rays can often detect damage to the bones caused by cancer, or new bone that's growing because of cancer.\u00a0They can also determine whether your symptoms are\u00a0caused by\u00a0something else, such as a broken\u00a0bone (fracture).\nIf\u00a0an X-ray suggests you may have bone cancer, you should be referred to a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and treating the condition. As bone cancer is\u00a0rare,\u00a0there are a\u00a0small number of specialist centres, so you may have to travel outside your local area for advice and treatment.\nBiopsy\nThe most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. This is known as a biopsy.\nA biopsy can determine exactly what type of bone cancer you have and what grade it is (see below).\nA biopsy can be\u00a0carried out\u00a0in two ways:\n\nA core needle biopsy is\u00a0performed under anaesthetic (depending on where the bone is located, this could be a\u00a0local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic).\u00a0A thin needle is inserted into the bone and used to remove a sample of tissue.\nAn open biopsy is\u00a0performed under a general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes an incision in the affected bone to remove a sample of tissue.\n\nYou may need to have an open biopsy if the results of a core needle biopsy are inconclusive.\nFurther tests\nIf the results of the biopsy confirm or suggest bone cancer, it's likely you'll have further tests to assess how far the cancer has spread. These tests are described below.\nA\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the bones and soft tissues.\nAn MRI scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumour in or around the bones.\nA computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0involves taking a series of X-rays and using a computer to reassemble them into a detailed three-dimensional (3D) image of your body.\nCT scans are often used to check if the cancer has spread to your lungs. Chest X-rays may also be taken for this purpose.\nA bone scan can\u00a0give more detailed information about the inside of your bones than an X-ray. During a bone scan,\u00a0a small amount of radioactive material is injected into your veins.\nAbnormal areas of bone will absorb the material at a faster rate than normal bone and will show up as \"hot spots\" on the scan.\nIf you have a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma, you may have a test called a bone\u00a0marrow biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the bone marrow (the tissue inside your bones).\nDuring the test,\u00a0a needle is inserted into your bone to remove a sample of your bone marrow. This may be done under either local or general anaesthetic.\nStaging and grading\nOnce these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you what stage and grade the bone cancer is. Staging is a description of how far a cancer has spread and grading is a description of how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future.\nA widely used staging system for bone cancer in\u00a0the UK\u00a0uses 3 main stages:\n\nstage 1 \u2013 the cancer is low-grade and has not spread beyond the bone\nstage 2 \u2013 the cancer has still not spread beyond the bone, but is a high-grade\nstage 3 \u00a0\u2013 the cancer has spread into other parts of the body, such as the lungs\n\nMost cases of stage 1 bone cancer and some stage 2 bone cancers have a good\u00a0chance of being cured. Unfortunately, stage 3 bone cancer is more difficult to cure, although treatment can relieve symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer.\nCoping with a diagnosis\nBeing told\u00a0you have bone cancer can be a distressing and frightening experience. Receiving that type of news can be upsetting at any age, but can be particularly difficult if you are still in your teenage years, or\u00a0if you're a parent of a child who has just been told\u00a0they have bone cancer.\nThese types of feelings can cause considerable stress and anxiety, which in some cases can trigger\u00a0depression. If you think you may be depressed,\u00a0your GP may be a good person to talk to about support and possibly\u00a0treatment.\nYou may also find it useful to contact the Bone Cancer Research Trust, which is the UK\u2019s leading charity for people affected by bone cancer, if you need more information. If you're a teenager you may want to contact the Teenage Cancer Trust, which is a charity for teenagers and young adults affected by cancer.\u00a0\nRead more about coping with a cancer diagnosis\n\n\nTreatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have, how far it has spread and your general health. The main treatments are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nYour treatment plan\nYour treatment should be managed by a specialist centre with experience in treating bone cancer, where you'll be cared for by a team of different healthcare professionals known as a multi-disciplinary team (MDT).\nMembers of the MDT will include an orthopaedic surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in bone and joint surgery), a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer) and a specialist cancer nurse, among others.\nYour MDT will recommend what they think is the best treatment for you, but the final decision will be yours.\nYour recommended treatment plan may include a combination of:\n\nsurgery to remove the section of cancerous bone \u2013 it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed, although amputation\u00a0is occasionally necessary\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0treatment\u00a0with powerful cancer-killing medication\nradiotherapy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where\u00a0radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells\n\nIn some cases, a medication called mifamurtide may be recommended as well.\nSurgery\nSurgery to remove the cancerous area of bone is an important part of treatment for bone cancer, although it's often combined with the other treatments mentioned below.\nNowadays, it's usually possible to avoid removing an affected body part completely (known as limb-sparing surgery), although up to 1 in every 10 people may need to have a limb permanently removed (amputation).\nLimb-sparing surgery is usually possible when the cancer has not spread beyond the bone, and the bone can be reconstructed.\nThe most common type of limb-sparing surgery involves removing the section of affected bone and some of the surrounding tissue (in case any cancerous cells have spread into the tissue).\nThe removed section of bone\u00a0may then be\u00a0replaced with a metal implant called a prosthesis or a piece of bone from elsewhere in your body (bone graft).\nIf the cancer is near a joint, such as the knee, it may be\u00a0possible to remove the joint and replace it with an artificial one. Read more about\u00a0knee joint replacement and hip joint replacement.\nAmputation\u00a0may be necessary if limb-sparing surgery is not possible or has not worked well. For example, it may be necessary if:\n\nthe cancer has spread beyond the bone into major blood vessels or nerves\nyou developed an infection after limb-sparing surgery and the prosthesis or bone graft had to be removed\u00a0\nthe cancer has developed in a part of the body where limb-sparing surgery is not technically possible, such as the ankle\n\nYour care team will understand the shock and fear that you, or your child, may be feeling if an amputation is needed and should be able to provide you with\u00a0counselling and other support. In some cases, your care team may be able to introduce you to someone who has already had an amputation.\nAfter an amputation, most people use an artificial limb to replace the limb that's removed. These limbs are now very advanced and convenient to use. For example, people with an artificial leg are often able to walk, run and play sport, and have an excellent quality of life.\nAfter limb-sparing surgery or an amputation, you'll need help to return to normal life. This is known as rehabilitation.\nRehabilitation will usually involve physiotherapy\u00a0sessions, where you carry out exercises to help regain proper function in the treated body part, and occupational therapy, where you're taught skills to help you cope with day-to-day activities.\nAfter an amputation, you may be referred to a local limb centre for advice, support and rehabilitation treatment.\u00a0Read more about living with an amputation.\nChemotherapy\nThere are 4 ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bone cancer. It can be used:\n\nbefore surgery, to shrink the tumour and make surgery easier\nin combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation)\u00a0\u2013 this approach works particularly well in the treatment of\u00a0Ewing sarcoma\nafter surgery, to prevent the cancer returning\nto control symptoms in cases where a cure is not possible (known as palliative chemotherapy)\n\nChemotherapy for bone cancer involves taking a combination of different medications that are usually delivered via a drip into your vein, or into a line inserted into a bigger blood vessel.\nThe\u00a0treatment is\u00a0usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to allow your body to recover from the effects of the treatment. The number of cycles\u00a0you\u00a0need will depend on the type and grade of your bone cancer.\nChemotherapy can damage healthy cells as well as cancerous cells, which means it often causes a number of side effects.\nCommon side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\nnausea\u00a0and vomiting\u00a0\ndiarrhoea\nmouth ulcers\u00a0\ntiredness\nincreased risk of catching infections\ntemporary hair loss\ninfertility\u00a0\n\nMost side effects associated with chemotherapy should resolve once your treatment has finished. However, there is a risk\u00a0you will be permanently infertile. Your care team will provide more detailed information about the specific risk to your fertility.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nRadiotherapy\nAs with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used before and after surgery to treat bone cancer, or used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure is not possible.\nRadiotherapy for bone cancer involves beams of radiation being directed at the cancerous section of bone by an external machine.\nThis is normally given in daily sessions, 5 days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.\nThe radiation you're exposed to during radiotherapy will mostly be focused on the cancerous cells, but healthy cells nearby can also be damaged. This can lead to\u00a0side effects such as:\n\nreddening and irritation of the skin (this can feel much like sunburn)\njoint pain in the part of the body that is being treated\nfeeling sick\nhair loss in the body part being treated\ntiredness\n\nThese side effects will pass once the radiotherapy has been completed, although feelings of tiredness may persist for several weeks.\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy\nMifamurtide\nFor people with a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may be used alongside other treatments.\nMifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant. This means it works by encouraging the immune system to produce specialised cells\u00a0that kill cancerous cells.\nIt's normally recommended for young people with\u00a0high-grade osteosarcomas and is given\u00a0after surgery, in combination with chemotherapy, to help prevent the cancer returning.\nMifamurtide is slowly pumped into one of your veins over the course of an hour (known as infusion). The recommended course of treatment is usually twice a week for 12 weeks, and then once a week for a further 24 weeks.\nMifamurtide can cause a wide range of side effects. These can include:\n\nnausea and vomiting\u00a0\ndiarrhoea or\u00a0constipation\nheadache\u00a0\ndizziness\nloss of appetite\ntiredness and weakness\n\nIt's unclear whether it's safe to take mifamurtide during pregnancy, so as a precaution it's important\u00a0to\u00a0use an effective method of contraception if you're a sexually active woman. You will need to tell your MDT as soon as possible if you\u00a0think you're\u00a0pregnant, and you should avoid breastfeeding while taking mifamurtide.\nFollow-up\nOnce your treatment has finished, you'll need to attend regular follow-up appointments to check\u00a0the cancer hasn't returned.\nYou'll be asked to attend frequent appointments in the first two years after treatment has finished \u2013 possibly every 3 months.\u00a0These will\u00a0become less frequent as the years go on.\nContact your specialist or GP if you develop\u00a0symptoms of bone cancer again and think the cancer may have come back.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "This section about bone cancer is for teenagers and young adults. There are different types of bone cancer, and most of this information applies to all types. If you have a rare type of bone cancer and want to know more, you could talk to Macmillan.\nIf you're looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0bone cancer section.\nTypes of bone cancer\nThere are different types of bone cancer. The\u00a02 most common bone cancers to affect teenagers are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.\nOsteosarcomas are most likely to affect bones in the leg, especially around the knee joint, but they can affect any bone.\nEwing sarcoma can affect any bone, but it\u2019s most common in the pelvis (which is made up of the tail bone and the\u00a02 hip bones), or in leg bones. Ewing sarcoma can sometimes start outside the bone in the soft tissue. This is called soft tissue Ewing sarcoma, and is treated in the same way. Sarcoma is the name for a cancer that starts in any connective tissue, such as muscle, fat or cartilage.\nIn this information we sometimes use the term \u2018bone tumour\u2019. This means the same as bone cancer.\nCauses\nThe cause of bone cancer is unknown. Because it\u2019s more common in young people, doctors think that it may be linked to the changes that happen when bones are growing. There is lots of ongoing research into the possible causes.\nPeople often think a knock or injury might have caused bone cancer, but there\u2019s no evidence for this.\nRemember that nothing you\u2019ve done has caused the cancer.\nSigns and symptoms of bone cancer\nBone cancer symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. Many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains.\nThe main symptoms are:\n\npain\u00a0or tenderness\u00a0\u2013 this may start as an ache that doesn\u2019t go away and may be made worse by exercise or feel worse at night\nswelling around the affected area of bone\u00a0\u2013 swelling may not show up until the tumour is quite large and it isn\u2019t always possible to see or feel a lump if the affected bone is deep inside the body\nreduced movement\u00a0\u2013 if the bone tumour is near a joint (like an elbow or knee), it can make it harder to move the joint; if it\u2019s in a leg bone, it may cause a limp; if it\u2019s in the backbone (spine), it may press on nerves and cause tingling and numbness in the legs or arms\na\u00a0broken bone\u00a0\u2013 a bone may break suddenly, or after only a minor fall or accident if the bone has been weakened by cancer.\n\nThere might also be other symptoms including:\n\ntiredness\u00a0\na\u00a0high temperature\u00a0\nloss of appetite\u00a0\nweight loss\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms, or you are worried that you may have a bone tumour, you should get it checked by your GP. They can talk to you about your symptoms, and arrange\u00a0tests\u00a0if they feel they\u2019re needed.\nRemember\u00a0\u2013 most people with these symptoms won\u2019t have bone cancer.\n\n\nKnowing what your bones do might help you understand what bone cancer is.\nBones are like human scaffolding. They help keep\u00a0you upright. The human skeleton is made up of more than 200 bones of different shapes and sizes.\nBones do lots of important things:\u00a0\n\nthey work with joints and connective tissue so that\u00a0you can move around\nthey protect parts of the body from injury\u00a0\u2013 for example, the ribs protect the heart and lungs\nthey store calcium\nsome bones contain bone marrow, which make blood cells\n\nJoints\nJoints help bones fit together so that we can move freely. There are different types of joint. Some work as levers, like the finger joint. Others are ball-and-socket joints, such as the hip joint. There are different types of connective tissue that help bones move:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nligaments are tough cords of tissue that attach bones to each other\ncartilage is a slippery material that covers the ends of bones to stop them rubbing together\nmuscles are made of tough, stretchy tissue\u00a0and give strength\ntendons are strong cords of tissue that attach muscles to bones\n\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms of bone cancer\u00a0\nhaving tests for bone cancer\u00a0\ntreatment for bone cancer\u00a0\nlife after bone cancer\u00a0\n\nIf you're looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0bone cancer section.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are some tests you might have when you visit your GP or at the hospital. The tests will help the doctors see whether you have bone cancer.\nVisiting your GP\nIf you think you might have some of the symptoms of bone cancer, you should speak to your GP.\nYour GP will talk to you about your symptoms, examine you and usually arrange some tests, such as X-rays and blood tests. There may be a number of reasons why you're feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. If your GP can't find the cause, you may be referred to a specialist at the hospital.\nAt the hospital\nThe hospital you're referred to will depend on the results of the tests. You may go straight to a doctor specialising in bone cancer, or you might see doctors with more general experience first.\nThe hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the following tests:\u00a0\n\nX-rays\u00a0\nbone scans\u00a0\nbiopsies\u00a0\nMRI and/or CT scans\n\nIf you're diagnosed with bone cancer and not already seeing a specialist bone doctor, you\u2019ll be referred to one.\u00a0\nFurther tests\nIf the tests show you have bone cancer, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general:\u00a0\n\nblood tests\u00a0\ntests to check your heart is healthy\u00a0\nchest X-rays to check your lungs are healthy\u00a0\ntests to check your kidneys are healthy\u00a0\u2013 you may need to give a sample of\u00a0pee (urine) to be tested\n\nThis may seem like a lot of tests, but they\u2019ll help the doctors plan the best treatment for you.\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help.\nWe have more information about:\n\nthe bones\nsymptoms of bone cancer\u00a0\ntreatment for bone cancer\u00a0\nlife after bone cancer\u00a0\n\nIf you're looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0bone cancer section.\n\n\nThe information on this page is about Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. If you have a different type of bone cancer and want to know more, you can talk to Macmillan.\nThe\u00a03 main treatments for bone cancer are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Most people have a combination of these.\nYour doctors will plan your treatment based on:\u00a0\n\nthe type of bone cancer you have\u00a0\nwhere the cancer is\u00a0\nthe stage of the cancer (this means whether it has spread outside the bone)\u00a0\nhow fast-growing the cancer is\n\nIf you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. They'll be happy to help you understand what's involved.\nYou may be offered the opportunity to take part in a clinical research trial. These trials help doctors find new and better treatments for people with bone cancer. If your doctor thinks you are suitable for a clinical trial, they'll discuss this with you.\nIn this information we sometimes use the term \u2018bone tumour\u2019. This means the same as bone cancer.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is when you\u2019re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. It\u2019s an important treatment for bone tumours. It helps shrink the tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, and it can kill cells that have spread outside the bone. After your surgery or radiotherapy, you\u2019ll usually have more chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy for bone cancer is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a PICC line.\nYou\u2019ll have chemotherapy over a few days and then you\u2019ll have some time off to give your body a chance to recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy and the rest period afterwards is called a cycle. Most people have several cycles of chemotherapy. You'll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy.\u00a0\nThe type of chemotherapy you have depends on whether the tumour is an Ewing sarcoma or an osteosarcoma.\nFor Ewing sarcoma, the drugs most often used first are vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide. Giving these drugs together is called VIDE. You\u2019ll usually have\u00a06 cycles of VIDE.\nAfter your chemotherapy you may have surgery, or, if the tumour can\u2019t be removed with an operation, you\u2019ll have radiotherapy. Some people have both surgery and radiotherapy. The team looking after you will decide on the best combination for you.\nIf you have surgery, you\u2019ll have more chemotherapy afterwards to help stop the tumour coming back or spreading to other parts of the body.\nAt the moment, there is a clinical trial called Euro-Ewing 2012 that is comparing different combinations of chemotherapy treatments before and after surgery for people with Ewing sarcomas. You can talk to your specialist doctor about whether you could take part in this trial.\nOsteosarcoma is usually treated with\u00a03 chemotherapy drugs called methotrexate, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cisplatin. Giving these drugs together is called MAP.\nYou will usually have\u00a06 cycles of chemotherapy in total. Each cycle takes about\u00a05 weeks. After the first\u00a02 cycles, you\u2019ll have surgery to remove the cancer.\nIf the cancer has spread, you may also need to have surgery on another part of your body. For example, if osteosarcoma spreads outside of the main tumour, it usually spreads to the lungs. If the cancer has spread to your lungs, you may need a second operation to remove the cancer in your lungs. If you have bone cancer that's spread, your doctors will talk to you about what will happen next.\nAfter surgery, you\u2019ll have\u00a04 more cycles of MAP chemotherapy. You may also be given a new treatment called mifamurtide (Mepact), which helps your body kill tumour cells.\u00a0Your doctor will tell you if you can have this drug as well as your chemotherapy.\nDifferent chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some people have just a few side effects and others have more. It's hard to know how it's going to be for you. Most side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops.\nThe most common are a sore mouth, hair loss, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection.\nThe most common side effect of mifamurtide is having a high temperature or feeling cold and shivery for a few hours after it\u2019s given.\nSurgery\nThe surgery you have will depend on the type of bone cancer you have and where it is in the body.\nYour surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, while trying to keep as much function in the limb as possible.\nMost people with bone cancer have an operation called limb-sparing surgery. This means the surgeon removes the cancer without having to remove the arm or leg it\u2019s in. You\u2019ll have all the tumour taken away from your limb, including any bone and muscle affected by the tumour.\nIt\u2019s usually possible to remove the affected part of the bone and replace it with a custom-made metal fitting (endoprosthesis) or with a bone from another part of the body (bone graft). If the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, the whole joint can often be replaced with an artificial one.\u00a0In some cases, the surgeon can remove the affected bone without replacing it with anything and without it affecting the way you move.\nIf you've had chemotherapy, you'll need\u00a02 or\u00a03 weeks to recover before you can have your operation. Doctors will make sure that you're well enough to have the operation. If you\u2019ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit before the operation. The hospital dietitian can help you do this. You\u2019ll probably see a physiotherapist, who\u2019ll give you exercises to strengthen your muscles.\nYou may like to see the replacement part or endoprosthesis (often just called a prosthesis) that will be put in during your operation. If you would like to see it, your surgeon or key worker can usually arrange this.\nYou\u2019ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it supported and let it heal.\nYou\u2019ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. This stops fluid building up in your wound. A nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days.\nYou won\u2019t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you\u2019ll be given fluids into a vein. This is called a drip.\nYou\u2019ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you\u2019ll be given strong painkillers to help. It\u2019s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. The pain usually starts to get better within 2 or 3 days. As time goes on, you'll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable.\nOnce you\u2019re home, you should start to feel a bit better and stronger every day. But if you do have any problems, it\u2019s important to tell your doctor or nurse right away, so they can deal with them quickly.\nAfter your operation, you will need to do lots of physiotherapy to help you make the best possible recovery. This can feel like hard work but is really important. Your physiotherapist will tell you what exercises to do, and help you to do them regularly.\nIf you notice any new redness, pain or swelling in the limb that\u2019s been operated on, it\u2019s very important to get in touch with your doctor right away. You might have an infection that needs treatment, so you\u2019ll need to see the surgeon who did your operation without delay.\nThere's more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section on living with and after bone cancer.\nSometimes the only way to get rid of the bone cancer affecting an arm or a leg is to remove the limb. This is called an amputation. It\u2019s only done if there is no alternative. This is usually needed if the cancer has spread from the bone and has grown around nearby blood vessels. These need to be removed along with the cancer.\nSome people choose to have an amputation rather than limb-sparing surgery. You should be given a chance to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of surgery with your team.\nAn amputation may also need to be done if there\u2019s an infection in the bone that doesn\u2019t go away with treatment, or if the cancer comes back in the bone. Every person and every tumour is different, so you might meet other people with the same type of tumour, who are having slightly different surgery. Your specialist will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand what's involved.\nYour doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what\u2019s involved. Losing a limb can feel very scary and it might help to talk to your specialist nurse, key worker or a counsellor about your feelings. It might also help to talk to someone who\u2019s had an amputation\u00a0\u2013 your nurse or doctor can arrange this. It's really important to get support at this tough time.\nYou\u2019ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that\u2019s been operated on. There\u2019ll be a tube, called a drain, coming from the wound. This stops fluid building up. A nurse will usually take it out after 3 or 4 days. You\u2019ll also have a drip to give you fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again.\nYou\u2019ll probably feel a bit sore after your op, especially for the first 2 or 4 days, but you'll be given strong painkillers to help with this. It\u2019s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. As time goes on, you\u2019ll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. You may have pain that feels like it\u2019s coming from the part of the limb that\u2019s been removed. This is known as \u2018phantom pain\u2019. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. There are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. It usually gets better and goes away in time.\nA physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. They\u2019ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible.\nIf you\u2019ve had an arm removed, you\u2019ll be able to get up and move around once you\u2019ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don\u2019t feel too sore. If you\u2019ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. You'll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days.\nOnce you\u2019re up and about, you\u2019ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. This is a big part of your recovery. Your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger.\nIt\u2019ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won\u2019t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis until this happens. In the meantime, you\u2019ll be given a temporary prosthesis and learn how to use it in physiotherapy.\nYou should be able to go home about\u00a02 weeks after your operation.\nThere's more information about the long-term effects of amputation in our section on living with and after bone cancer.\nRadiotherapy\u00a0\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells.\nRadiotherapy is mainly used to treat Ewing sarcoma. You may have radiotherapy after your chemotherapy, or before or after having surgery.\nIf you have osteosarcoma, you\u2019re less likely to have radiotherapy treatment. But you might have it if an operation to remove the cancer isn\u2019t possible. Occasionally, people with osteosarcoma have radiotherapy after surgery to remove their cancer.\nRadiotherapy is generally given every weekday (Monday to Friday) for\u00a05 weeks. Each treatment takes a few minutes.\nRadiotherapy isn't painful, but it can cause other side effects. After a few treatments you may begin to feel tired, and your skin may go red or get darker and feel sore or itchy around the area that\u2019s being treated. This gets better once your radiotherapy treatment is over.\nOther side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. Having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms of bone cancer\nhaving tests for bone cancer\u00a0\nlife after bone cancer\u00a0\nthe bones\n\nIf you're looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0bone cancer section.\u00a0\n\n\nThis information is about life after having surgery for bone cancer.\nLife after limb-sparing surgery\nThe long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. The best person to ask about this is your surgeon.\nAfter limb-sparing surgery, the limb might not work as well as it used to. Physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. You\u2019ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. These can be hard work, but it\u2019s important to keep going with them.\nIf you\u2019ve had a knee joint replacement, you\u2019ll be able to walk and swim, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. These activities could damage or loosen the new joint.\nIt\u2019s usually\u00a0OK to run a short distance, for example for a bus. But running or jogging regularly wears out the new joint, so it\u2019s best to avoid this. If your knee joint wears out or loosens, you might need to have it replaced after a few years.\nAfter a hip joint replacement, you should be able to do most of your usual activities, but you\u2019ll probably be advised to avoid running and high-impact sports.\nIf you\u2019ve had a shoulder replacement, you\u2019ll be able to move your arm below shoulder height the same as before, but you might not be able to lift your arm above your shoulder.\nIf you\u2019ve had an implant put into your limb while you\u2019re still growing, you\u2019ll need to have it lengthened as your leg or arm grows. Some types of implant can be lengthened without an operation, but with others you\u2019ll need surgery. Your specialist or key worker can tell you what kind of implant you have.\nLife after amputation\nAfter amputation, you usually have an artificial limb fitted. This is called a prosthesis. There are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports.\nDifferent types of prosthesis let you do different things. Some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.\nHow will I feel?\nThings may be tough as you get used to living with the changes in your body, but help is available. You might have lots of different emotions. You might be tearful, angry, fed up or sad at times. You might feel like you've lost all your confidence and that you'll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. These feelings are normal, and it's important to get support to help you cope with them. You could talk to:\u00a0\n\nyour specialist nurse or key worker\u00a0\nfamily or friends\u00a0\na counsellor, which can be arranged by your nurses\u00a0\nother young people in a similar situation, for example through Macmillan's\u00a0online community or a support group\n\nOther people's reactions can be hard to cope with too. You might be worried about what your friends think or how they're going to treat you. The thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. Even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. Others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful.\nTry to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends who you can talk to if things get you down. You might find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like your specialist nurse, key worker or counsellor. Most people find it helps to talk about how they're feeling or what\u2019s on their mind.\nFollow-up\nWhen you finish your treatment, your doctor will talk to you about what happens next. They will explain some of the long-term risks that bone cancer and its treatment could have for you. They will make arrangements to see you in a clinic to see how you are getting on.\nWe have more info about:\n\nthe bones\nsymptoms of bone cancer\u00a0\nhaving tests for bone cancer\u00a0\ntreatment for bone cancer\n\nIf you're looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0bone cancer section.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer.\nCancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer.\nBowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe 3 main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit\u00a0\u2013 such as more frequent, looser stools\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0abdominal (tummy) pain.\nHowever, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by\u00a0haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually\u00a0the result of\u00a0something you have eaten.\nAs almost 9\u00a0out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments.\nMost people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combinations of\u00a0symptoms:\n\na persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools\na persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain\nblood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage\nabdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss\n\nThe symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don't necessarily make you feel ill.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nRead about the symptoms of\u00a0bowel cancer, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary.\nYour doctor will probably carry out a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps.\nThey may also\u00a0arrange for a simple blood test to check for\u00a0iron deficiency anaemia. This can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel that you haven't been aware of.\nIn some cases, your doctor may decide it is best for you to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms.\nMake sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age.\nRead more about diagnosing bowel cancer\nWho's at risk?\nIt's not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. These include:\n\nage \u2013 almost\u00a09 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over\ndiet \u2013 a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk\nweight \u2013 bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese\nexercise \u2013 being inactive increases the risk of getting bowel cancer\nalcohol and smoking \u2013 a high alcohol intake and smoking may increase your chances of getting bowel cancer\nfamily history \u2013 having a close relative (mother or father, brother or sister) who developed bowel cancer\u00a0under the age of\u00a050 puts you at a greater lifetime risk of developing the condition\n\nSome people have an increased risk of bowel cancer because they have another condition that affects their bowel, such as severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, over a long period of time.\nRead more about the causes of bowel cancer and preventing bowel cancer\nBowel cancer screening\nBowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland to help find bowel cancer early when it can often be cured.\nBowel screening involves taking a simple test at home every 2 years. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, as this could mean a higher chance of bowel cancer.\nRead more about screening for bowel cancer\nTreatment\nBowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread.\nThe main treatments are:\n\nsurgery \u2013\u00a0the cancerous section of bowel is removed; it is the most effective way of curing bowel cancer, and is all that many people need\nchemotherapy \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells\u00a0\nradiotherapy \u2013 where radiation is used to kill cancer cells\nbiological treatments \u2013 a newer type of medication that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreading\n\nAs with most types of cancer, the chances of a complete cure depends on how far\u00a0it\u00a0has advanced by the time it is diagnosed.\nRead more about how bowel cancer is treated and living with bowel cancer\n\n\nThe 3 main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), a change in bowel habit, such as more frequent, looser stools, and abdominal (tummy) pain.\nHowever, these symptoms are very common. Blood in the stools is usually caused by haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is often the result of\u00a0something you have eaten.\nIn the UK, an estimated 7 million people have blood in the stools each year. Even more people have temporary changes in their bowel habits and abdominal pain. Most people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer.\nAs the vast majority of people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older.\u00a0These symptoms\u00a0are also more significant when they persist in spite of simple treatments.\nMost patients with bowel cancer present with one of the following symptom combinations:\n\na persistent change in bowel habit, causing them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools\na persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain\nblood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching, or a lump hanging down outside the back passage\nabdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss\n\nThe symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don't necessarily make you feel ill.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nRead about the symptoms of\u00a0bowel cancer, and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary.\nYour doctor will probably perform a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps, as well as\u00a0a simple blood test to check for\u00a0iron deficiency anaemia.

This is known as a bowel obstruction.\nSymptoms of a bowel obstruction can include:\n\nsevere abdominal pain, which may initially come and go\nnot being able to pass stools when you go to the toilet\nnoticeable swelling or bloating of the tummy\nvomiting\n\nA bowel obstruction is a medical emergency. If you suspect your bowel is obstructed, you should see your GP quickly. If this isn't possible, go to the accident and emergency (A&E) department of your nearest hospital.\nRead further information:\n\nBeating Bowel Cancer: symptoms\nBowel Cancer UK:\u00a0symptoms of bowel cancer\nCancer Research UK:\u00a0bowel cancer symptoms\n\n\n\nCancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nMost cases of bowel cancer first develop inside clumps of cells on the inner lining of the bowel. These clumps are known as polyps. However, if you develop polyps, it does not necessarily mean you will get bowel cancer.\nExactly what causes cancer to develop inside the bowel is still unknown. However, research has shown several factors may make you more likely to develop it.\u00a0\nAge\nYour chances of developing bowel cancer increase as you get older. Almost\u00a09 out of 10 cases of bowel cancer in the UK are diagnosed in people over the age of 60.\nFamily history\nHaving a family history of bowel cancer can increase your risk of developing the condition yourself, particularly if a close relative (mother, father, brother or sister) was diagnosed with bowel cancer below the age of 50.\nIf you are particularly concerned that your family's medical history may mean you are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, it may help to speak to your GP.\nIf necessary, your GP can refer you to a genetics specialist, who can offer more advice about your level of risk and recommend any necessary tests to periodically check for the condition.\nDiet\nA large body of evidence suggests a diet high in red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing bowel cancer.\nFor this reason, the Department of Health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) a day of red and processed meat cut down to 70g a day.\nRead more about red meat and bowel cancer risk\nThere is also evidence that\u00a0suggests a diet high in fibre could help reduce your bowel cancer risk.\nRead more about eating good food and a healthy diet\nSmoking\nPeople who smoke cigarettes are more likely to develop bowel cancer, other types of cancer, and other serious conditions, such as\u00a0heart disease.\nRead more about stopping smoking\nAlcohol\nDrinking alcohol has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly if you regularly drink large amounts.\nRead about alcohol for information and tips on cutting down\nObesity\nBeing overweight or obese is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly in men.\nIf you are overweight or obese, losing weight may help lower your chances of developing the condition.\nInactivity\nPeople who are physically inactive have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer.\nYou can help reduce your risk of bowel and other cancers by being physically active every day.\nRead more about health and fitness\nDigestive disorders\nSome conditions affecting the bowel may put you at a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. For example, bowel cancer is more common in people who have had severe\u00a0Crohn's disease\u00a0or ulcerative colitis for many years.\nIf you have one of these conditions, you will usually have regular check-ups to look for signs of bowel cancer from about 10 years after your symptoms first develop.\nCheck-ups will involve examining your bowel with a colonoscope\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a long, narrow flexible tube\u00a0that contains\u00a0a small camera\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that is inserted into your rectum.\nThe frequency of the colonoscopy examinations will increase the longer you live with the condition, and will also depend on factors such as how severe your ulcerative colitis is and if you have a family history of bowel cancer.\nGenetic conditions\nThere are two rare inherited conditions that can lead to bowel cancer. They are:\n\nfamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) \u2013 a condition that triggers the growth of non-cancerous polyps inside the bowel\nhereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome \u2013 an inherited gene fault (mutation) that increases your bowel cancer risk\n\nAlthough the polyps caused by FAP are non-cancerous, there is a high risk that, over time, at least one will turn cancerous. Most people with FAP will have bowel cancer by the time they are 50.\nAs people with FAP have such a high risk of getting bowel cancer, they are often advised by their doctor to have their large bowel removed before they reach the age of 25.\nFamilies affected can find support and advice from FAP registries such as The Polyposis Registry provided by St Mark's Hospital, London.\nRemoving the bowel as a precautionary measure is also usually recommended in people with HNPCC because the risk of developing bowel cancer is so high.\nRead further information:\n\nBeating Bowel Cancer: causes\nBowel Cancer UK: why do I need fibre in my diet?\nCancer Research UK: risk factors\n\n\n\nWhen you first see your GP, they will ask about your symptoms and whether you have a family history of bowel cancer.\nThey will then usually carry out a simple examination of your abdomen (tummy) and your bottom, known as a digital rectal examination (DRE).\nThis is a useful way of checking whether there are any lumps in your tummy or back passage. The tests can be uncomfortable, and most people find an examination of the back passage a little embarrassing, but they take less than a minute.\nIf your symptoms suggest you may have bowel cancer or the diagnosis is uncertain, you will be referred to your local hospital initially for a simple examination called a flexible sigmoidoscopy.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected bowel cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on suspected cancer: recognition and referral.\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy\nA flexible sigmoidoscopy is an examination of your rectum and some of your large bowel using a device called a sigmoidoscope.\nA sigmoidoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a very small camera and light. It is inserted into your rectum and up into your bowel.\nThe camera relays images to a monitor, and can also be used to take biopsies, where a small tissue sample is removed for further analysis.\nIt is better for your lower bowel to be as empty as possible when sigmoidoscopy is performed, so you may be asked to carry out an enema\u00a0\u2013 a simple procedure to flush your bowels\u00a0\u2013 at home beforehand. This should be used at least two hours before you leave home for your appointment.\nA sigmoidoscopy can feel uncomfortable, but it only takes a few minutes and most people go home straight after the examination.\nMore detailed tests\nMost people with bowel cancer can be diagnosed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. However, some cancers can only be diagnosed by a more extensive examination of the colon.\nThe two tests used for this are colonoscopy and computerised tomography (CT) colonography.\u00a0\nA colonoscopy is an examination of your entire large bowel using a device called a colonoscope, which is like a sigmoidoscope but a bit longer.\nYour bowel needs to be empty when a colonoscopy is performed, so you will be advised to eat a special diet for a few days beforehand and take a laxative (medication to help empty your bowel) on the morning of the examination.\nYou will be given a sedative to help you relax during the test, after which the doctor will insert the colonoscope into your rectum and move it along the length of your large bowel. This is not usually painful, but can feel uncomfortable.\nThe camera relays images to a monitor, which allows the doctor to check for any abnormal areas within the rectum or bowel that could be the result of cancer. As with a sigmoidoscopy, a biopsy may also be performed during the test.\nA colonoscopy usually takes about\u00a0an hour to complete, and most people can go home once they have recovered from the effects of the sedative.\nAfter the procedure, you will probably feel drowsy for a while, so you will need to arrange for someone to accompany you home. It is best for elderly people to have someone with them for 24 hours after the test. You will be advised not to drive for 24 hours.\nIn a small number of people, it may not be possible to pass the colonoscope completely around the bowel, and it is then necessary to have CT colonography.\nFind out more about what\u00a0a colonoscopy involves\nCT colonography, also known as a 'virtual colonoscopy', involves using a computerised tomography (CT) scanner to produce three-dimensional images of the large bowel and rectum.\nDuring the procedure, gas is used to inflate the bowel using a thin, flexible tube placed in your rectum. CT scans are then taken from a number of different angles.\nAs with a colonoscopy, you may need to have a special diet for a few days and take a laxative before the test to ensure your bowels are empty when the test is carried out.\nThis test can help identify potentially cancerous areas in people who are not suitable for a colonoscopy\u00a0because of\u00a0other medical reasons.\nA CT colonography is a less invasive test than a colonoscopy, but you may still need to have colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy at a later stage so any abnormal areas can be removed or biopsied.\nRead further information:\n\nAssociation of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland: bowel cancer symptom checker\nBeating Bowel Cancer: diagnosis\nBowel Cancer Information: hospital tests\nCancer Research UK:\u00a0bowel cancer tests\nMacmillan:\u00a0diagnosing colon cancer\u00a0\n\nFurther tests\nIf a diagnosis of bowel cancer is confirmed, further testing is usually carried out to check if the cancer has spread from the bowel to other parts of the body.\u00a0These tests also help your doctors decide on the most effective treatment for you.\nThese tests can include a:\n\nCT scan of your abdomen and chest \u2013\u00a0this will check if the rest of your bowel is healthy and whether the cancer has spread to the liver or lungs\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0\u2013 this can provide a detailed image of the surrounding organs in people with cancer in the rectum\n\nStaging and grading\nOnce the above examinations and tests have been completed, it should be possible to determine the stage and grade of your cancer.\nStaging refers to how far your cancer has advanced. Grading relates to how aggressive your cancer is\u00a0and how\u00a0likely it is\u00a0to spread.\nThis is important, as it helps your treatment team choose the best way of curing or controlling the cancer.\nA number of different staging systems are used by doctors.\u00a0\n\nstage 1 \u2013 the cancer is still contained within the lining of the bowel or rectum\nstage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread beyond the layer of muscle surrounding the bowel and may have penetrated the surface covering the bowel or nearby organs\nstage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes\nstage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread beyond the bowel into another part of the body, such as the liver\n\nThere are 3 grades of bowel cancer:\n\ngrade 1 \u2013 a cancer that grows slowly and has a low chance of spreading beyond the bowel\ngrade 2 \u2013 a cancer that grows moderately and has a medium chance of spreading beyond the bowel\ngrade 3 \u2013 a cancer that grows rapidly and has a high chance of spreading beyond the bowel\n\nIf you are not sure what stage or grade of cancer you have, ask your doctor.\n\n\nIf\u00a0colon cancer is at a very early stage, it may be possible to remove just a small piece of the lining of the colon wall. This is known as local excision.\nIf the cancer spreads into\u00a0muscles surrounding the colon, it will usually be necessary to remove an entire section of your colon.\u00a0This is known as a colectomy.\nThere are 2 ways a colectomy can be performed:\n\nan open colectomy \u2013 where the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon\na laparoscopic (keyhole) colectomy \u2013 where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of colon\n\nDuring surgery, nearby lymph nodes are also removed. It is usual to join the ends of the bowel together after bowel cancer surgery, but very occasionally this is not possible and a stoma is needed.\nBoth open and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective at removing cancer and have similar risks of complications.\nHowever, laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of a faster recovery time and less postoperative pain. It is becoming the routine way of doing most of these operations.\nLaparoscopic colectomies should be available in all hospitals that carry out bowel cancer surgery, although not all surgeons perform this type of surgery. Discuss your options with your surgeon to see if this method can be used.\nSurgery for rectal cancer\nThere are a number of different types of operation that can be carried out to treat rectal cancer, depending on how far the cancer has spread.\nSome of the main techniques used are described below:\nIf you have a very small, early-stage rectal cancer, your surgeon may be able to remove it in an operation called a local resection (transanal resection).\nThe surgeon puts an endoscope in through your back passage and removes the cancer from the wall of the rectum.\nIn many cases, however, a local resection is not possible. Instead, a larger area of the rectum will need to be removed.\nThis area will\u00a0include a border of rectal tissue free of cancer cells, as well as fatty tissue\u00a0from around the bowel\u00a0(the mesentery). This type of operation is known as total mesenteric excision (TME).\nRemoving the mesentery can help ensure all the cancerous cells are removed, which can lower the risk of the cancer recurring at a later stage.\nDepending on where in your rectum the cancer is located, one of two main TME operations may be carried out.\nLow anterior resection is a procedure used to treat cases where the cancer is in the upper section of your rectum.\nThe surgeon will make an incision in your abdomen and remove the upper section of your rectum, as well as some surrounding tissue to make sure any lymph glands containing cancer cells are also removed.\nThey will then attach your colon to the lowest part of your rectum or upper part of the anal canal. Sometimes they turn the end of the colon into an internal pouch to replace the rectum.\nYou will probably require a temporary stoma\u00a0to give the joined section of bowel time to heal.\nAbdominoperineal resection is used to treat cases where the cancer is in the lowest section of your rectum.\nIn this case, it will be necessary to remove the whole of your rectum and surrounding muscles to reduce the risk of the cancer regrowing in the same area.\nThis involves removing and closing the anus and removing its sphincter muscles, so there is no option except to have a permanent stoma after the operation.\nBowel cancer surgeons always do their best to avoid giving people permanent stomas wherever possible.\nStoma surgery\nWhere a section of the bowel is removed and the remaining bowel joined, the surgeon may sometimes decide to divert your stool away from the join to allow it to heal.\nThe stool is temporarily diverted by bringing a loop of bowel out through the abdominal wall and attaching it to the skin \u2013 this is called a stoma. A bag is worn over the stoma to collect the stool.\nWhen the stoma is made from the small bowel (ileum) it is called an ileostomy, and when it is made from the\u00a0large bowel (colon) it is called a colostomy.\u00a0\nA specialist nurse, known as a stoma care nurse, can advise you on the best site for a stoma\u00a0prior to surgery.\nThe nurse will take into account factors such as your body shape and lifestyle, although this may not be possible where surgery is performed in an emergency.\nIn\u00a0the first few days\u00a0after surgery, the stoma care nurse will advise on the care necessary to look after the stoma and the type of bag suitable.\nOnce the join in the bowel has safely healed, which can take several weeks, the stoma can be closed\u00a0during further surgery.\nIn some people, for various reasons, rejoining the bowel may not be possible or may lead to problems controlling bowel function, and the stoma may become permanent.\nBefore having surgery, the care team will advise you about whether it may be necessary to form an ileostomy or colostomy, and the likelihood of this being temporary or permanent.\nThere are patient support groups available that provide support for patients who have just had or are about to have a stoma. You can\u00a0get more\u00a0details from\u00a0your stoma care nurse, or visit the groups\u00a0online for further information.\nIleostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group\u00a0provides a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery\nLearn more about\u00a0coping with a stoma after bowel cancer\nSide effects of surgery\nBowel cancer operations carry many of the same risks as other major operations, including bleeding, infection, developing blood clots, or heart or breathing problems.\u00a0\nThe operations all carry a number of risks specific to the procedure. One risk is that the joined-up section of bowel may not heal properly and leak inside your abdomen. This is usually only a risk in the first few days after the operation.\nAnother risk is for people having rectal cancer surgery. The nerves that control urination\u00a0and sexual function are very close to the rectum, and sometimes\u00a0surgery to remove rectal cancer can damage these nerves.\nAfter rectal cancer surgery, most people need to go to the toilet to open their bowels more often than before, although\u00a0this usually settles down within a few months of the operation.\nRadiotherapy\nThere are 2 main ways radiotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer. It can be given before surgery to shrink rectal cancers and increase the chances of complete removal, or be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of cancer in advanced cases (palliative radiotherapy).\nRadiotherapy given before surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in 2 ways:\n\nexternal radiotherapy \u2013 where a machine is used to beam high-energy waves at your rectum to kill cancerous cells\ninternal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) \u2013 where a radioactive tube is inserted into your anus and placed next to the cancer to shrink it\n\nExternal radiotherapy is usually given daily, 5 days a week, with a break at the weekend. Depending on the size of your tumour, you may need 1 to 5 weeks of treatment. Each session of radiotherapy is short and will only last for 10 to 15 minutes.\nInternal radiotherapy can usually be performed in one session before surgery is carried out a few weeks later.\nPalliative radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions, with a course ranging from 2 to 3 days, up to 10 days.\nShort-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:\n\nfeeling sick\nfatigue\ndiarrhoea\nburning and irritation of the skin around the rectum and pelvis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this looks and feels like sunburn\na frequent need to urinate\na burning sensation when passing urine\n\nThese side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has finished. Tell your care team if the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome. Additional treatments are often available to help you cope with the side effects\u00a0better.\nLong-term side effects of radiotherapy can include:\n\na more frequent need to pass urine or stools\nblood in your urine and stools\ninfertility\nerectile dysfunction\n\nIf you want to have children, it may be possible to store a sample of your sperm or eggs before treatment begins so they can be used in fertility treatments in the future.\nChemotherapy\nThere are 3 ways\u00a0chemotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer:\n\nbefore surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0used in combination with radiotherapy\u00a0to shrink the tumour\nafter surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring\npalliative chemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 to slow the spread of advanced bowel cancer and help control symptoms\n\nChemotherapy for bowel cancer usually involves taking a combination of medications that kill cancer cells. They can be given as a tablet (oral chemotherapy), through a drip in your arm (intravenous chemotherapy), or as a combination of both.\nTreatment is given in courses (cycles) that are 2 to 3 weeks long each, depending on the stage or grade of your cancer.\nA single session of intravenous chemotherapy can last from several hours to several days.\nMost people having oral chemotherapy take tablets over the course of two weeks before having a break from treatment for another week.\nA course of chemotherapy can last up to 6 months, depending on how well you respond to the treatment. In some cases, it can be given in smaller doses over longer periods of time (maintenance chemotherapy).\nSide effects of chemotherapy can include:\n\nfatigue\nfeeling sick\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\nmouth ulcers\nhair loss with certain treatment regimens, but this is generally uncommon in the treatment of bowel cancer\na sensation of numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet and neck\n\nThese side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished. It usually takes a few months for your hair to grow back if you experience hair loss.\nChemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nInform your care team or GP as soon as possible if you experience possible signs of an infection, including high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of being generally unwell.\nMedications used in chemotherapy can cause temporary damage to men's sperm and women's eggs. This means that for women who become pregnant or for men who father a child, there is a risk to the unborn baby's health.\u00a0\nIt\u00a0is therefore\u00a0recommended you use a reliable method of contraception while having chemotherapy treatment and for a period after your treatment has finished.\nFind out more about\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0\u00a0\nBiological treatments\nBiological treatments, including cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab, are a newer type of medication also known as monoclonal antibodies.\nMonoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have been genetically engineered in a laboratory. They target special proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR).\nAs EGFRs help the cancer grow, targeting these proteins can help shrink tumours, and improve the effect and outcome of chemotherapy.\nBiological treatments are therefore usually used in combination with chemotherapy when the cancer has spread beyond the bowel (metastatic bowel cancer).\nThese treatments are not available to everyone with bowel cancer. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has specific criteria\u00a0that need to be met before these can be prescribed.\nCetuximab is only available on the NHS when:\n\nsurgery to remove the cancer in the colon or rectum has been carried out or is possible\nbowel cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed surgically\na person is fit enough to undergo surgery to remove the cancer from the liver if this becomes possible after treatment with cetuximab\n\nCetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab are available on the NHS through a government scheme called the\u00a0Cancer Drugs Fund. All these medications are also available privately, but are very expensive.\nFurther information is\u00a0available from:\n\nMacmillan:\u00a0targeted therapies (biological therapies) for colon cancer\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): cetuximab for metastatic colorectal cancer\nBeating Bowel Cancer: surgery\nCancer Research UK: types of surgery for bowel cancer\nBowel Cancer UK:\u00a0radiotherapy for bowel cancer\nCancer Research UK:\u00a0radiotherapy for bowel cancer\nMacmillan:\u00a0radiotherapy for rectal cancer\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): preoperative brachytherapy for rectal cancer\n\n\n\nTalk to others\nYour GP or nurse may be able to reassure you if you have questions, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. Your GP surgery will have information on these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to others with bowel cancer at a local support group or through an internet chat room.\nBeating Bowel Cancer offers support services to people with bowel cancer. They run a\u00a0nurse advisory line on\u00a008450 719 301 or\u00a0020 8973 0011\u00a0available 9am to 5.30pm Monday to Thursday, and 9am to 4pm on Fridays.

These may include shock, anxiety, relief, sadness and depression.\nDifferent people\u00a0deal with serious problems in different ways. It is hard to predict how knowing you have cancer will affect you.\nHowever, you and your loved ones may find it helpful to\u00a0know about\u00a0the feelings that people diagnosed with cancer have reported.\nRead about\u00a0the emotional effects of cancer\nRecovering from surgery\nSurgeons and anaesthetists have found using an enhanced recovery programme after bowel cancer surgery helps patients recover more quickly.\nMost hospitals now use this programme.\u00a0It involves giving you more information\u00a0about what to expect\u00a0before the operation, avoiding giving you strong\u00a0laxatives to clean the bowel before surgery, and in some cases giving you a sugary drink\u00a0two hours before the operation to give you energy.\u00a0\nDuring and after the operation, the anaesthetist controls the amount of IV fluid you need very carefully, and after the operation you will be given painkillers that allow you to get up and out of bed by the next day.\nMost people will be able to eat a light diet the day after their operation.\nTo reduce the risk of\u00a0blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis), you may be given special compression stockings that help prevent blood clots, or a regular injection with a blood-thinning medication called\u00a0heparin until you are fully mobile.\nA nurse or physiotherapist will help you get out of bed and regain your strength so you can go home within a few days.\nWith the enhanced recovery programme, most people are well enough to go home within a week of their operation. The timing depends on when you and the doctors and nurses looking after you agree you are well enough to go home.\nYou will be asked to return to hospital a few weeks after your treatment has finished so tests can be carried out to check for any remaining signs of cancer. You may also need routine check-ups for the next few years to look out for signs of the cancer recurring.\nRead more about what to expect\u00a0after your operation for bowel cancer\nDiet after bowel surgery\nIf you have had part of your colon removed, it is likely your stools (faeces) will be looser\u00a0\u2013\u00a0one of the functions of the colon is to absorb water from stools.\nThis may mean you need to go to the toilet more often to pass loose stools. Inform your care team if this becomes a problem,\u00a0as medication is available to help control it.\nYou may find some foods upset your bowels, particularly during the first few months after your operation.\nDifferent foods can upset different people. Food and drink known to cause problems include:\n\nfruit and vegetables that are high in fibre, such as beans, cabbages, apples and bananas\nfizzy drinks, such as cola and beer\n\nYou may find it useful to keep a food diary to record the effects of different foods on your bowel.\nContact your care team if you find you are having continual problems with your bowels as a result of your diet, or you are finding it difficult to maintain a healthy diet. You may need to be referred to a dietitian for further advice.\nRead more about diet after treatment.\nLiving with a stoma\nIf you need a temporary or permanent stoma with an external bag or pouch, you may feel worried about how you look and how others will react to you.\nInformation and advice about living with a stoma\u00a0\u2013 including stoma care, stoma products and stoma-friendly diets\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is available on the ileostomy and colostomy\u00a0topics.\nFor those\u00a0who want further information about living with a stoma, there are patient support groups\u00a0that provide support for people who may have had, or are due to have a stoma.\nYou can\u00a0get more\u00a0details\u00a0from your stoma care nurse, or visit support groups online for further information. The\u00a0Ileostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group\u00a0organisation provide a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery.\nFind out more about\u00a0coping with a stoma after bowel cancer\nSex and bowel cancer\nHaving cancer and\u00a0receiving treatment may affect how you feel about relationships and sex. Although most people are able to enjoy a normal sex life after bowel cancer treatment, you may feel self-conscious or uncomfortable\u00a0if you have\u00a0a stoma.\nTalking about how you feel with your partner may help you both support each other. Or you may feel\u00a0you'd like to talk to someone else about your feelings. Your doctor or nurse will be able to help.\nFind more information on\u00a0body image and intimate relations\u00a0\nFinancial concerns\nA diagnosis of cancer can cause money problems because you are unable to work, or someone you are close to has to stop working to look after you.\nThere is financial support available for carers and yourself if you have to stay off work for a while or stop work because of your illness.\u00a0\nVisit Macmillan for information on your finances\nThe following organisations could also offer help\u00a0or information:\n\nGOV.UK:\u00a0benefits\nMoney Advice Service\n\nDealing with dying\nIf you are told there is nothing more that can be done to treat your bowel cancer, your GP will still provide you with support and pain relief.

If you\u2019re 75 or over, you can still take a bowel screening test every 2 years. However, you\u2019ll need to request a new test kit each time.\nRead more about bowel cancer screening\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Bowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. It's also sometimes known as faecal incontinence.\nThe experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person. Some people feel a sudden need to go to the toilet but are unable to reach a toilet in time. This is known as urge bowel incontinence.\nOther people experience no sensation before soiling themselves, known as passive incontinence or passive soiling, or there might be slight soiling when passing wind.\nSome people experience incontinence on a daily basis, whereas for others it only happens from time to time.\nIt's thought 1\u00a0in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their life. It can affect people of any age, although it's more common in elderly people. It's also more common in women than men.\nWhy bowel incontinence happens\nBowel incontinence is\u00a0a symptom of an underlying problem or medical condition.\nMany cases are caused by diarrhoea, constipation, or weakening of the muscle that controls the opening of the anus.\nIt can also be caused by long-term conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis and dementia.\nRead more about the causes of bowel incontinence.\nSeeking advice and treatment\nBowel incontinence can be upsetting and hard to cope with, but treatment is effective and a cure is often possible, so make sure you see your GP.\nIt's important to remember that:\n\nBowel incontinence isn't something to be ashamed of \u2013 it's simply a medical problem that's no different from\u00a0diabetes or asthma.\nIt can be treated \u2013 there's a wide range of successful treatments.\nBowel incontinence isn't a normal part of ageing.\nIt won't usually go away on its own \u2013 most people need treatment for the condition.\n\nIf you don't want to see your GP, you can usually make an appointment at your local NHS continence service without a referral. These clinics are staffed by specialist nurses who can offer useful advice about incontinence.\nRead more about diagnosing bowel incontinence.\nHow bowel incontinence is treated\nIn many cases, with the right treatment, a person can maintain normal bowel function throughout their life.\nTreatment will often depend on the cause and how severe it is, but possible options include:\n\nlifestyle and dietary changes to relieve constipation or diarrhoea\nexercise programmes to strengthen the muscles that control the\u00a0bowel\nmedication to control diarrhoea and constipation\nsurgery, of which there are a number of different options\n\nIncontinence products, such as anal plugs and disposable pads, can be used until your symptoms are better controlled.\nEven if\u00a0it isn't possible to\u00a0cure your\u00a0bowel incontinence, symptoms\u00a0should\u00a0improve significantly.\nRead more about treating bowel incontinence.\n\n\nBowel incontinence is usually caused by a physical problem with the parts of the body that control the bowel.\nThe\u00a0most common problems are:\n\nproblems with the rectum \u2013\u00a0the rectum is unable to retain poo properly until it's time to go to the toilet\nproblems with the sphincter muscles \u2013 the muscles at the bottom of the rectum don't work properly\nnerve damage \u2013\u00a0the nerve signals sent from the rectum don't reach the brain\n\nThese problems are explained in more detail below.\nIt's important to discuss any bowel problems with your GP as there's a small chance they could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as bowel cancer.\nProblems with the rectum\nConstipation is a leading cause of bowel incontinence.\nIn cases of severe constipation, a large, solid stool can become stuck in the rectum. This is known as faecal impaction. The stool then begins to stretch the muscles of the rectum, weakening them.\nWatery stools can leak around the stool and out of the bottom, causing bowel incontinence. This is called overflow incontinence and\u00a0happens most commonly in elderly people.\nRepeated straining caused by constipation or faecal impaction can also lead to rectal prolapse, when part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your bottom. Rectal prolapse may also lead to bowel incontinence.\nIt's difficult for the rectum to hold liquid stools (diarrhoea), so people with diarrhoea (particularly recurring diarrhoea) can develop bowel incontinence.\nConditions that can cause recurring diarrhoea include:\n\nCrohn's disease \u2013 inflammation of the digestive system\nirritable bowel syndrome \u2013 a condition that causes a range of digestive problems, such as diarrhoea and bloating\nulcerative colitis \u2013 inflammation of the large bowel\n\nThese conditions can also cause scarring of the rectum, which can lead to bowel incontinence.\nHaemorrhoids (piles) are enlarged blood vessels inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). Symptoms include discomfort, itching, bleeding or a lump hanging down outside of the anus.\nIn severe cases, haemorrhoids may lead to bowel incontinence.\nProblems with the sphincter muscles\nThe sphincter muscles at the bottom of the rectum control the bowel. Bowel incontinence happens if these muscles become weakened or damaged.\nChildbirth is a common cause of damage to the sphincter muscles and a leading cause of bowel incontinence. During a vaginal birth, the sphincter muscles can become stretched and damaged, particularly as a result of a forceps delivery. Other causes include a large baby, the baby being born with the back of their head facing the mother's back (occipitoposterior position) and a long labour.\nSphincter muscles can also become damaged through injury, or damage from bowel or rectal surgery.\nNerve damage\nBowel incontinence can also be caused by a problem with the nerves connecting the brain and the rectum. A nerve problem can mean your body is unaware of stools in your rectum, and may make it difficult for you to control your sphincter muscles.\nDamage to these nerves is related to a number of conditions, including:\n\ndiabetes\u00a0\nmultiple sclerosis (a condition of the central nervous system)\nstroke\nspina bifida (birth defects that affect the development of the spine and nervous system)\n\nAn injury to these nerves, such as a spinal injury, can also lead to bowel incontinence.\nOther health conditions\nIn some cases, bowel incontinence may result from a health condition such as dementia or a severe learning disability that causes the person to lose bowel control.\nA physical disability can also make it difficult to get to the toilet in time.\n\n\nYour GP will begin by asking you about the pattern of your symptoms and other related issues, such as your diet.\nYou may find this embarrassing, but it's important to answer as honestly and fully as you can to\u00a0make sure\u00a0you receive the most suitable treatment. Let your doctor know about:\n\nany changes in your bowel habits\u00a0lasting for more than a few weeks\nrectal bleeding\nstomach pains\nany\u00a0changes to\u00a0your diet\nany medication you're taking\n\nYour GP will usually carry out a physical examination. They'll look at your anus and the surrounding area to check for damage and carry out\u00a0a rectal examination,\u00a0inserting\u00a0a gloved finger into your bottom.\nA rectal examination\u00a0will show whether constipation is the cause, and check for\u00a0any tumours in your rectum. Your GP may ask you to squeeze your rectum around their finger to assess how well the muscles in your anus are working.\nDepending on the results, your GP may refer you for further tests.\nFurther tests\nDuring an\u00a0endoscopy, the inside of your rectum (and in some cases your lower bowel) is examined using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end (endoscope). Images can also\u00a0be taken of the inside of your body.\nThe endoscope\u00a0checks whether there's any obstruction, damage or inflammation in your rectum.\nAn\u00a0endoscopy isn't painful, but\u00a0it can feel uncomfortable, so you may be given a sedative to relax you.\nAnal manometry helps to assess how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working.\nThe test uses a device that looks like a small thermometer with a balloon attached to the end.\u00a0It's inserted into your rectum and the balloon is inflated. It may feel unusual, but it's not uncomfortable or painful.\nThe device is attached to a machine, which measures pressure readings taken from the balloon.\nYou'll be asked to squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles at certain times. You may also be asked to push the balloon out of your rectum in the same way you push out a stool. The pressure-measuring machine gives an idea of how well your muscles are working.\nIf the balloon is inflated to a relatively large size but you don't feel any sensation of fullness, it may mean there are problems with the nerves in your rectum.\nAn\u00a0ultrasound scan can be used to create a detailed picture of the inside of your anus. Ultrasound scans are particularly useful in detecting underlying damage to the sphincter muscles.\nDefecography is a test used to study\u00a0how you\u00a0pass stools. It can also be useful in detecting signs of obstruction or prolapse that haven't been discovered during a rectal examination.\nDuring this test, a liquid called barium is placed into your rectum. The barium helps make it easier to\u00a0highlight problems using an X-ray. Once the barium is in place, you'll be asked to pass stools in the usual way while scans are taken.\nThis test is occasionally carried out using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner instead of an X-ray.\n\n\nTreatment for bowel incontinence depends on underlying cause and the pattern of your symptoms.\nTrying the least intrusive treatments first, such as dietary changes and exercise programmes, is often recommended.\nMedication and surgery are usually only considered if other treatments haven't worked.\nThe various treatments for bowel incontinence\u00a0are outlined below.\u00a0\nContinence products\nYou may find it helpful to use continence products until your bowel incontinence is better controlled. Most continence products are available for free on the NHS.\nAnal plugs are one way to prevent involuntary soiling. An anal plug is made of foam and designed to be inserted into your bottom. However, they can be uncomfortable and they're not really a long term solution.\nIf the plug comes into contact with moisture from the bowel, it expands and prevents leakage or soiling. Anal plugs can be worn for up to 12 hours, after which time they are removed using an attached string.\nDisposable body pads are contoured pads that soak up liquid stools and protect your skin. They can be used in cases of mild bowel incontinence.\nSingle-use silicone inserts, which form a seal around the rectum until your next bowel movement, are also being investigated as a treatment option for moderate to severe bowel incontinence.\nYour local NHS continence service can offer help and advice about continence products, and you don't usually need a referral from your GP to make an appointment. These clinics are staffed by nurses who specialise in continence treatment.\n\nWear trousers or skirts that are easy to undo and have elasticated waistbands rather than buttons.\nDisability Rights UK\u00a0offers access to 9,000 disabled toilets around the UK with a Radar NKS key.\u00a0The key costs \u00a34.50 and is only sold to people who require use of toilet facilities due to a disability or health condition.\n\nDietary changes\nBowel incontinence associated with diarrhoea or constipation can often be controlled by making changes to your diet.\nIt may be beneficial\u00a0to keep a food diary to record the effect of your diet on your symptoms.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published dietary advice for managing diarrhoea in cases of irritable bowel syndrome. These guidelines can also be applied to people with diarrhoea associated with bowel incontinence.\nThe advice from NICE includes the following:\n\nlimit fibre intake from wholegrain breads, bran, cereals, nuts and seeds (except golden linseeds)\navoid skin, pips and pith from fruit and vegetables\nlimit fresh and dried fruit to 3\u00a0portions a day and\u00a0fruit juice to 1\u00a0small glass a day (make up the recommended \u20185\u00a0a day\u2019 with vegetables)\nlimit how often you have fizzy drinks\u00a0and drinks containing caffeine\navoid foods high in fat, such as chips, fast foods and burgers\n\nA high-fibre diet is usually recommended for most people with constipation-associated bowel incontinence. Your GP can tell you if a high-fibre diet is suitable for you.\nFibre can soften stools, making them easier to pass. Foods that are high in fibre include:\n\nfruit and vegetables\nbeans\nwholegrain rice\nwholewheat pasta\nwholemeal bread\nseeds, nuts and oats\n\nDrink plenty of fluids because this can help to soften your stools and make them easier to pass.\nPelvic floor muscle training\nPelvic floor muscle training is a type of exercise programme used to treat cases of bowel incontinence caused by weakness in the pelvic floor muscles.\nA therapist, usually a physiotherapist or specialist nurse, will teach you a range of exercises. The goal of pelvic floor muscle training is to strengthen any muscles that may have been stretched and weakened.\nYou'll probably be required to carry out the exercises 3\u00a0times a day, for 6\u00a0to 8\u00a0weeks. After this time, you should notice an improvement in your symptoms.\nCheck with your health professional before trying these at home.\nFirst, pretend you're trying to hold in a bowel movement. You should feel the muscles around your anus tighten.\nNext, sit, stand, or lie in a comfortable position with your legs slightly apart.\n\nSqueeze\u00a0your pelvic floor\u00a0muscles for as long as you can, then relax. Repeat 5\u00a0times.\nSqueeze the muscles as hard as you can, then relax. Repeat 5\u00a0times.\nSqueeze the muscles quickly, then relax. Repeat 5\u00a0times.\n\nIf you find these exercises\u00a0too difficult, try fewer repetitions at first and build them up. If they get too easy, try doing more repetitions. You can do the exercises without anyone knowing about them, so they should be easy to fit into your daily routine.\nBowel retraining\nBowel retraining is a type of treatment for people with reduced sensation in their rectum as a result of nerve damage, or for those who have recurring episodes of constipation.\nThere are 3\u00a0goals in bowel retraining:\n\nto improve the consistency of your stools\nto establish a regular time for you to empty your bowels\nto find ways of stimulating your bowels to empty themselves\n\nChanges to your diet usually improve stool consistency (see above).\nEstablishing a regular time to empty your bowels means\u00a0finding the most convenient time when you can\u00a0go to the toilet without being rushed.\nWays to stimulate bowel movements can differ from person to person. Some people find a hot drink and meal can help. Others may need to stimulate their anus using their finger.\nBiofeedback is a type of bowel retraining exercise that involves placing a small electric probe into your bottom.\nThe sensor relays detailed information about the movement and pressure of the muscles in your rectum to an attached computer.\nYou're then asked to perform a series of exercises designed to improve your bowel function. The sensor checks that you\u00a0are performing the exercises in the right way.\nMedication\nMedication can be used to help treat soft or loose stools or constipation associated with bowel incontinence.\nLoperamide\u00a0is a\u00a0medicine widely\u00a0used to treat diarrhoea. It works by slowing down the movement of stools through the digestive system, allowing more water to be absorbed from the stools. Loperamide can be prescribed in low doses to be taken regularly over a long period of time.\nLaxatives\u00a0are used to treat constipation. They're a type of medicine that helps you to pass stools. Bulk-forming laxatives are usually recommended.\u00a0These help your stools to retain fluid. This means they're less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction.\nEnemas or rectal irrigation\nRectal irrigation or enemas\u00a0are used when bowel incontinence is caused by faecal impaction and other treatments have failed to remove the impacted stool from the rectum.\nThese procedures involve\u00a0a small tube that is placed into your anus. A special solution is then used to wash out your rectum.\nSurgery\nSurgery is usually only recommended after all other treatment options have been tried.\nThe main surgical treatments used on the NHS are sphincteroplasty and sacral nerve stimulation. Other treatments \u2013 such as tibial nerve stimulation, endoscopic heat therapy and artificial sphincter surgery \u2013 can also be used, but their availability on the NHS is limited.\nAn operation called a colostomy is more widely available on the NHS, but it's only used if other treatments are unsuccessful.\nThese treatments are outlined in more detail below.\nA sphincteroplasty is an operation to repair damaged sphincter muscles. The surgeon removes some of the muscle tissue and the muscle edges are overlapped and sewn back together. This provides extra support to the muscles, which makes them stronger.\nSacral nerve stimulation is a treatment used for people with weakened sphincter muscles.\nElectrodes are inserted under the skin in the lower back and connected to a pulse generator. The generator releases pulses of electricity that stimulate the sacral nerves, which causes\u00a0the sphincter and pelvic floor muscles to work more effectively.\nAt\u00a0first, the pulse generator is located outside your body. If the treatment is effective, the pulse generator will be implanted deep under the skin in your back.\nThe most commonly reported complications of the procedure are infection at the site of surgery and technical problems with the pulse generator, which require additional surgery to correct.\nSee the NICE guidelines on\u00a0Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence.\nTibial nerve stimulation is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence.\nA fine needle is inserted into the tibial nerve just above the ankle and an electrode is placed on the foot.\u00a0A mild electric current is passed through the needle to stimulate the tibial nerve. It's not known exactly how this treatment works, but it's thought to work in a similar way to sacral nerve stimulation.\nNICE concludes that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works.\nSee\u00a0the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence by stimulating the tibial nerve.\nBulking agents, such as collagen or silicone, can be injected into the muscles of the sphincter and rectum to strengthen them.\nThe use of bulking agents in this way is a fairly new technique, so there's little information about their long-term effectiveness and safety.\nYou should discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of this type of treatment in full with your treatment team before deciding whether to proceed.\nSee the NICE guidelines on\u00a0Treating faecal incontinence with injectable bulking agents.\nEndoscopic radiofrequency (heat) therapy is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence.\nHeat energy is applied to the sphincter muscles through a thin probe, to encourage scarring of the tissue. This helps tighten the muscles and helps to control bowel movements.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u00a0recently produced guidelines on this procedure.\u00a0NICE concluded that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works.\nAs well as the uncertainties surrounding this procedure, it is also expensive. Therefore, it is usually only used on the NHS during clinical trials.\nSee\u00a0the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence using endoscopic radiofrequency therapy.\nAn artificial sphincter may be implanted if you have bowel incontinence caused by a problem with your sphincter muscles.\nThis operation involves placing a circular cuff under the skin around the anus.\u00a0The cuff is filled with fluid and sits tightly around the anus, keeping it closed.\nA tube is placed under the skin from the cuff to a control pump. In\u00a0men, the pump is placed near the testicles, in\u00a0women it\u2019s placed near the vagina. A special balloon is placed into the tummy, and this is\u00a0connected to the control pump by tubing that runs under the skin.\nThe\u00a0pump\u00a0is activated by pressing a button located under the skin. This drains the fluid from the cuff into the balloon, so your anus opens and you\u00a0can pass stools. When you are finished, the fluid slowly refills the cuff and the anus closes.\nThe use of an artificial sphincter is a\u00a0relatively new procedure, so there isn't much good-quality information about\u00a0its long-term effectiveness and safety.\nPossible problems\u00a0include infection, injury during surgery and the cuff becoming dislodged. In some cases, further surgery is required to correct problems.\nSee the NICE guidelines on\u00a0Treating faecal incontinence with an artificial sphincter inserted through a cut in the abdomen.\nA\u00a0colostomy is usually only recommended if other surgical treatments are unsuccessful.\nA colostomy is a surgical procedure in which your colon (lower bowel) is cut and brought through the wall of your stomach to create an artificial opening. Your stools can then be collected in a bag, known as a colostomy bag, which is attached to the opening.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "This section is for teenagers and young adults. It\u2019s about the brain and different types of brain tumour.\nAny illness to do with your brain can be scary. Understanding a bit more about how the brain works might help.\nThe brain\nThe brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is the \u2018control centre\u2019 which coordinates most body functions. It is inside the skull, which protects it. The spinal cord is made up of nerves that run down the spine. It passes messages between the brain and the rest of the body.\nThe brain and the spinal cord are covered by 3 thin layers of tissue called the meninges. Between\u00a02 of these layers is a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The meninges and CSF help to protect the brain and spinal cord.\nThe main parts of the brain are the:\n\ncerebrum\ncerebellum\nbrain stem\npituitary gland\n\nThis is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. It\u2019s made up of\u00a02 halves called hemispheres. It controls thinking, learning, memory, problem solving, emotions, and touch. It also makes us aware of our body position.\nThis is at the back of the head, near the middle. It controls movement, balance and coordination.\nThis connects the brain to the spinal cord. It\u2019s in the lower part of the brain, just above the back of the neck. It controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing.\nThis is in the middle of the brain. It makes hormones that control things such as growth, metabolism, periods, and sperm production.\nTypes of brain tumour\nThere are different types of brain tumour. They are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). This information is about both types.\nBenign brain tumours often press on the brain but don\u2019t usually spread into surrounding tissue. They are also less likely to spread around the brain and spinal cord. If they can be removed with an operation they may not cause any more problems. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to remove a benign tumour because of where it is in the brain. In this case, you might need treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nSome benign tumours can cause long-lasting changes. This can be because they increase the pressure inside the brain, or because they press on important areas of the brain.\nMalignant brain tumours can spread from where they started into surrounding brain tissue, causing pressure and problems in those parts of the brain. They can also spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into other parts of the brain or the spinal cord.\nThis information is about tumours that start in the brain, which are called primary brain tumours. Sometimes cancers that start in other parts of the body can spread to the brain. These are known as secondary brain tumours.\nThe types of brain tumour most likely to affect teenagers and young adults are:\n\npituitary tumours\ngliomas\nmedulloblastomas\ngerm cell tumours\n\nThese start in cells called glial cells. There are different types of glioma, but the ones that affect younger people are usually astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. These types of tumour can develop in the brain or in the spinal cord.\nThese are the most common type of glioma.\nAstrocytomas develop from a star-shaped cell called an astrocyte. Oligodendrogliomas look like a fried egg. Sometimes tumours are a mix of both cells. These are called oligoastrocytomas. Doctors group them by how quickly they grow (known as the grade of the tumour). They can tell the grade from how the cells look under a microscope.\nThese are a rarer type of glioma. They develop from the spinal cord, and from cells that line the fluid-filled spaces (ventricles) in the brain. These tumours can spread to\u00a0other parts of the brain and spine through the CSF.\nThese are usually benign tumours that grow in the pituitary gland. They are mostly grouped into pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas.\nSome cause too many or too few hormones to be produced in the body. They very rarely spread.\nThese usually start in the cerebellum, at the back of the brain. Sometimes they can spread through the CSF, or very rarely to other parts of the body. They start from cells that haven\u2019t properly developed yet, and are sometimes called primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET).\nThis type of tumour is rare. They develop from very early cells called germ cells, which have the potential to grow into any type of tissue.\nAlthough germ cell tumours often develop in the ovaries in girls or the testicles in boys, they can also start in other parts of the body, including the brain. They may be non-cancerous or cancerous. They are called by different names depending on what the cells look like under a microscope.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms of brain tumours\nhaving tests for brain tumours\ntreatment for brain tumours\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for information about brain tumours in people of all ages, read our general brain tumours section. We also have information about brain tumours in children.\n\n\nThis section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe symptoms of a brain tumour depend on the size of the tumour and where it is.\nThe tumour can:\n\ncause fits\naffect the messages sent by that part of the brain to other parts of the body\ncause \u2018raised intracranial pressure\u2019\u00a0\u2013 there\u2019s only a certain amount of space in the skull for the brain and as a tumour grows, there can be a rise in pressure in or around the brain\n\nCommon symptoms of \u2018raised intracranial pressure\u2019 are:\n\nheadaches, which are often worse in the morning\nvomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick\nfits (seizures)\nfeeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day\u00a0things like friends, school or going out\nproblems with your eyes, such as blurring or seeing double\nfeeling more sleepy or drowsy than usual\nchanges in your balance and walking, or weakness down one side of the body\nproblems with speech\npersonality changes\n\nThere\u2019s often a simple explanation for many of these symptoms. But if you have any of these or if you\u2019re worried, it\u2019s important to speak to your GP straight away.\nCauses\nThe cause of most brain tumours is unknown. Research is looking into this all the time.\nYoung people with rare genetic conditions that run in families, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2, have an increased chance of developing a brain tumour.\nMobile phones, power lines and certain viruses have all been suggested as possible causes of brain tumours. There\u2019s been a lot of research into these possible causes, especially mobile phones. But there has been no strong evidence for any of them.\nRemember\u00a0\u2013 nothing you\u2019ve done has caused the tumour.\nIf you\u2019re worried about brain tumours\nIf you think you might have any of the symptoms of a brain tumour, you should go straight to your GP. They'll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. They can arrange\u00a0tests to find out more, or refer you to a specialist doctor.\nWe also have more info about:\n\nhaving tests for brain tumours\ntreatment for brain tumours\nthe brain\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for information about\u00a0brain tumours in people of all ages, read our general brain tumours section. We also have information about brain tumours in children.\n\n\nThis section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.\nSeeing your GP\nYour GP will examine you and, depending on your symptoms, they may arrange some tests. Or they might send you to hospital straight away to see a doctor who specialises in problems to do with the brain. These doctors are called neurologists or neurosurgeons.\nSometimes a brain tumour is diagnosed after someone has been taken into hospital to check out symptoms that have happened suddenly, like having a fit.\nAt the hospital\nYou\u2019ll usually be seen at a hospital with a centre or unit specialising in treating brain tumours.\nYour specialist will ask you questions about your symptoms and how you\u2019ve been feeling. They\u2019ll examine the back of your eyes using an instrument with a light on the end of it to check for swelling. Swelling can be a sign of raised pressure in your head.\nThey\u2019ll usually check:\n\nyour balance\nyour coordination\nyour muscle strength\nyour reflexes\nwhether you can feel pinpricks on areas of your skin\n\nYou might also have your eyesight and hearing tested.\nYou\u2019ll need to have some more tests before a diagnosis is made. Your doctor will select the most suitable tests for your situation. These tests are important because they help your specialist plan the best treatment for you. Your doctor and specialist nurse will explain things to you, but don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions.\nMacmillan Cancer Support has information on the possible tests, which\u00a0include:\n\na CT scan or MRI scan\u00a0\u2013 these show a detailed picture of the inside of your head\nblood tests\u00a0\u2013 these are done to check your general health and sometimes to measure the level of certain chemicals or hormones in your blood\nlumbar punctures \u2013 in this test a small needle is used to collect some fluid from the base of your spine; it's sometimes done to look for cancer cells in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord\nX-rays\u00a0\u2013 might be taken to check your skull and chest\n\nDoctors often need to remove a small part of the tumour (biopsy) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. The piece of tumour that\u2019s removed is looked at under a microscope by a doctor called a pathologist. The operation will be done under general anaesthetic. This is where you are put into a deep sleep. You\u2019ll probably be in hospital for a few days.\nAn MRI or CT scan\u00a0is used to find the exact position of the tumour. The surgeon makes a small hole in the skull and passes a fine needle through it to remove a piece of the tumour.\nThis is often used to make sure the doctor takes the biopsy from the most appropriate part of the tumour. You will have a head frame fitted that will help guide the surgeon to exactly the right place before they take the biopsy. This is called a stereotactic biopsy.\nHaving tests and waiting for results can be scary. Remember \u2013 you don\u2019t have to keep your worries to yourself. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends or your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier. You could also talk to one of Macmillan's cancer support specialists on their free helpline.\nThis information is about having tests for brain tumours. We also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms of brain tumours\ntreatment for brain tumours\u00a0\nthe brain\n\nIf you're looking for information about brain tumours in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0brain tumours section.\n\n\nThis section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.\nA team of specialists will plan your treatment. They will talk to you about the best treatment for you.\nIt's normal to have a combination of treatments, so you may be seen by different doctors, such as:\n\na neurosurgeon, who specialises in brain operations\na neurologist, who treats brain conditions\na cancer specialist (oncologist), who treats brain tumours with radiotherapy and chemotherapy\n\nYou\u2019ll usually see a specialist nurse who looks after people with conditions affecting the brain, or a specialist nurse for teenagers or young adults with cancer. If you have radiotherapy (X-ray treatment) you will be given this treatment by a radiographer.\nThere are different types of brain tumours, so treatment won\u2019t be the same for everyone. Your doctors look at the type of brain tumour you have, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment for you.\nThe main treatments for brain tumours are:\u00a0\n\nsurgery\u00a0\u2013 an operation to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour\u00a0\nradiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 uses high-energy x-rays to treat cancer cells\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 uses anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells\u00a0\n\nYour specialist doctor and nurse will explain your treatment and answer any questions you have. It\u2019s important you understand what\u2019s involved. You\u2019ll probably need some time to talk it through with your family.\nMedicines you may need to take\nYou might need to take these medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour:\n\nsteroids, which can reduce swelling or inflammation in the brain and help with symptoms\nanticonvulsant medicines that help prevent fits (seizures)\n\nSurgery for brain tumours\nYour surgeon will usually try to remove all, or as much as possible, of the tumour. Before the operation, they will talk to you about what\u2019s involved and the benefits and risks of the operation. It\u2019s important you understand all this, so ask all the questions you want to.\nYou\u2019ll usually be in hospital for a week, sometimes longer. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what to expect before and after the operation as it can be different for everyone.\nBefore the operation you\u2019ll probably need to have some of your hair shaved off. This is done in the anaesthetic room. You may prefer to have all your hair shaved off. You can cover up with a wig or hat while it grows back.\nFor some types of brain tumours, particularly low-grade gliomas, your surgeon might suggest doing an operation while you are awake. This is called an 'awake craniotomy'. If you need this, you will be given plenty of medication to make sure it doesn't hurt.\nSometimes surgery is not needed, or it\u2019s not possible to remove the tumour. Your specialist may think that another treatment would be better for you. They will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions to help you understand your options.\nAfter the operation you are monitored very closely for the first 12 to 24 hours. At first you might be attached to a machine called a ventilator that helps you breathe. Your nurse or doctor will tell you if this is likely to happen.\nYour head might be bandaged and you\u2019ll have a tube draining any extra blood that\u2019s collected around the wound into a plastic bottle. You may also have another tube draining extra cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the brain). This is to make sure you don\u2019t get too much pressure building up inside your brain. Your doctor will remove these tubes as soon as it\u2019s safe, usually after a couple of days.\nYou\u2019ll have a drip to give you fluids until you\u2019re eating and drinking again. There may be some swelling and bruising around your face and eyes. This will settle down after a few days.\nWhen you wake up you might have a headache. You\u2019ll be given painkillers regularly until this eases off. Tell your nurse or doctor if you\u2019re in pain so that they can give you something stronger.\nRadiotherapy for brain tumours\nRadiotherapy\u00a0uses high-energy X-rays to treat cancer cells. It can be used:\n\nafter the operation to treat any cells that may have been left behind\ninstead of an operation when a brain tumour doesn\u2019t need to be or can\u2019t be removed\nif a brain tumour comes back after surgery\n\nFor some brain tumours, it\u2019s normal to treat your spinal cord (the nerves that go from your brain to your body) as well as your brain. Your doctor will tell you if this is the case.\nThere are\u00a03 types of radiotherapy that are used to treat brain tumours:\n\nphoton radiotherapy (given at your local hospital)\nproton radiotherapy (until 2018/2019 this is given in Switzerland or America)\nstereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (given at specialist hospitals in the UK)\n\nYour doctor will discuss with you which treatment would be best.\nYou\u2019ll have your treatment in the radiotherapy department of the hospital. It\u2019s usually given Monday to Friday, with a rest at the weekend. The number of treatments you have will depend on your situation, but it can last from 1 day to 7 weeks.\nYou will have to wear a mask or shell to keep your head as still as possible during radiotherapy treatment. This makes sure treatment is delivered to the exact area each time. Your mask is made before your treatment is planned. You\u2019ll be able to see and breathe properly, but it might feel a bit tight. You only have to wear it for a few minutes at a time. Most people find they get used to it pretty quickly. Let your nurse or radiographer know if you\u2019re worried about this.\nThe treatment only takes a few minutes. It isn\u2019t painful, but you need to lie very still. You\u2019ll be on your own in the room but you can talk to the radiographer through an intercom. In some hospitals you can have music playing while you have your treatment.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe side effects you might have will depend on the type of radiotherapy you\u2019re having and how long it lasts for. Your doctor and specialist nurse will tell you more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects you\u2019re having. There\u2019s usually something they can do to make things easier.\nYour hair in the treatment area will start to thin and fall out shortly after your treatment starts. Your doctor or nurse can show you where you will lose your hair.\nLosing your hair can be scary and really upsetting. There are lots of ways to cover up with hats, bandannas, baseball caps, scarves, or wigs until it grows back. Getting a shorter haircut before it starts to fall out sometimes makes it a little easier to cope with.\nIt usually starts to grow back within 3 months of finishing treatment. Hair may grow back with a slightly different colour and texture and might not be as thick as before.\nAlthough hair loss is usually temporary, for some people it can be permanent. Your specialist will usually be able to tell you if this is likely. This can be hard to deal with and you\u2019ll be given advice and support to help you cope.\nYou might get some skin changes\u00a0\u2013 a bit like sunburn\u00a0\u2013 in the area being treated, usually after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. At first it can be dry and itchy. If you\u2019ve got pale skin it might get red. If you\u2019ve got darker skin it can get darker. You should wash and dry the skin gently using non-perfumed soap and use only the moisturiser that the radiographer gives you. The radiographer or specialist nurse will give you advice on looking after your skin.\nYou may feel really tired towards the end of your treatment and for a few weeks after it has finished. This gradually improves after a few weeks. Try to get plenty of rest. It\u2019s also a good idea to do some gentle exercise if you can, like taking short walks. This helps to give you more energy and keep your muscles toned.\nLet your doctor know if this is a problem. They can prescribe anti-sickness medicines to help.\nIt\u2019s important to tell your doctor if you have headaches. They can prescribe pain\u00a0relief for you.\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring and after treatment, you might find your symptoms get a bit worse before they get better. This can be scary but it\u2019s usually a reaction to the radiotherapy. It doesn\u2019t mean the radiotherapy hasn\u2019t worked or that the tumour has got worse. If it happens, let your doctor or nurse know.\nSide effects that happen months or years after treatment has finished are called late (long-term) effects. These depend on the area of the brain treated. They can include patches of hair loss, worse concentration, memory changes and difficulty learning new things, reduced hormones, increased risk of a stroke, and a second tumour.\nYou\u2019ll be seen regularly for follow-up appointments and your doctors will be checking you for any late effects of treatment. Your doctors will explain more about this to you.\nChemotherapy for brain tumours\nChemotherapy\u00a0is the use of special anti-cancer drugs to destroy tumour cells. You might have chemotherapy:\n\nto shrink a tumour to make it easier to remove with surgery\nwhen it\u2019s not possible to remove the tumour completely with surgery\nduring radiotherapy to make the tumour more sensitive to radiation\nafter radiotherapy or surgery to reduce the chance of the tumour coming back (adjuvant chemotherapy)\nwhen a brain tumour has come back after treatment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMacmillan has information on the different chemotherapy drugs that can be used, such as:\n\nlomustine (CCNU)\nprocarbazine\nvincristine\ncisplatin or carboplatin\ntemozolomide (Temodal\u00ae)\ncyclophosphamide\nifosfamide\netoposide\n\nThe information on these drugs is written for people of all ages, not just for young people. There are lots of other drugs that are used and your doctor or nurse can tell you more about this.\nYou can also call\u00a0Macmillan's cancer support specialists for more information about chemotherapy drugs.\nChemotherapy can be given as a single drug or in combination with others. They can be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) or as tablets. Occasionally chemotherapy is given directly into the spine (intrathecal chemotherapy) or into the brain through a special device (ommaya reservoir).\u00a0\nAnother way of giving chemotherapy is for the surgeon to place a wafer containing chemotherapy in the area of the brain where the tumour was removed during the surgery. As the wafer dissolves, the chemotherapy drug is slowly released into the area of the brain that needs treatment.| \u00a0\nChemotherapy causes side effects that usually get better when treatment is over.\u00a0\nYou need to let your doctor or nurse know immediately if you have signs of an infection like feeling hot and shivery. This is because you can become unwell quite quickly while you are on chemotherapy.\nThis is a common side effect so it\u2019s important to get plenty of rest. Try to balance rest with some gentle exercise like short walks if you can. This helps give you more energy and keeps your muscles toned.\nYou\u2019ll be given anti-sickness medicines to take regularly. Let your nurse or doctor know if the ones you\u2019re taking aren\u2019t working for you.\nIf you lose your hair it will usually start to grow back again after your treatment stops.\nSome chemotherapy drugs can affect your fertility. Your doctor should discuss this with you before treatment begins.\u00a0\nYour doctor and nurse will tell you more about the side effects to expect depending on the chemotherapy you have. Let your doctor or nurse know about any side effects as there\u2019s often something that can be done to control them.\nSupportive treatment for brain tumours\nAs part of your treatment for a brain tumour you\u2019ll probably be given drugs called steroids. You may also be given some anticonvulsant drugs to prevent fits.\nSteroids help reduce the swelling that often surrounds a brain tumour. Although they don\u2019t treat the tumour itself, they can improve symptoms and make you feel better. Steroids are often given before and after surgery, and sometimes during or after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nIt\u2019s important to take steroids as your doctor tells you and not to suddenly stop them. If you take steroids for more than 2 weeks, it\u2019s important to tell your doctor about them if you are unwell (for example an infection) over the next 6 months. This is because you may need an extra course of steroids.\nIf you take steroids for some time, you may have some temporary side effects. These can include:\n\nweight gain\na change in the shape of your face (making it more rounded)\nindigestion\nslightly more risk of getting an infection\nmood changes (feeling \u2018hyper\u2019 or overactive or feeling low)\nincrease in the sugar level in your blood\u00a0\u2013 your blood or urine may be tested to check for this\n\nSide effects can be hard to cope with, especially with all the other stuff you have to deal with. Remember\u00a0\u2013 the side effects will gradually get better when the steroids are stopped, and in the meantime there are lots of people who can support you.\nTumours in the brain can sometimes cause fits. Anticonvulsant drugs can help prevent them. You might be prescribed these before surgery, or to take on a more long-term basis. Your doctors will tell you about any side effects of these drugs.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms of brain tumours\u00a0\nhaving tests for brain tumours\nthe brain\n\nIf you're looking for information about brain tumours in people of all ages,\u00a0read our general\u00a0brain tumours section.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK.\nMost women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also\u00a0get breast cancer.\nIf it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body.\nThe breasts\nThe breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed.\nThe body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.\nRead more about the causes of breast cancer\nSymptoms of breast cancer\nBreast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.\nMost breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:\n\na change in the size or shape of one or both breasts\ndischarge from either of your nipples\u00a0(which may be streaked with blood)\na lump or swelling in either of your armpits\ndimpling on the skin of your breasts\na rash on or around your nipple\na change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast\n\nBreast pain alone isn't a symptom of breast cancer.\nLearn more about the symptoms of breast cancer\nAfter examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests.\u00a0This might include a mammography (breast screening)\u00a0or a biopsy.\nRead more about\u00a0breast screening\u00a0and\u00a0how breast cancer is diagnosed\nTypes of breast cancer\nThere are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types.\nNon-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast.\nThis form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram. The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\nInvasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread.\nThe most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all\u00a0breast cancer cases and is sometimes called 'no special type'.\nOther less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's disease of the breast.\nIt's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it's known as 'secondary' or 'metastatic' breast cancer.\nBreast cancer screening\nThere's a good chance of recovery if breast cancer is detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP.\nMammographic screening (where X-ray\u00a0images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery.\nWomen with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition.\nAs the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50\u00a0to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every 3 years.\nWomen over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit.\nThe NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47\u00a0to 73.\nRead more about\u00a0breast screening and find breast cancer screening services near you\nTreating breast cancer\nIf cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body.\nBreast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments.\nThe type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you.\nIn a\u00a0small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is\u00a0to achieve remission (symptom relief).\nRead more about treating breast cancer\nPreventing breast cancer\nAs the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether.\nIf you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk.\nStudies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly and who have a low intake of saturated\u00a0fat and alcohol.\nIt's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.\nRead more about preventing breast cancer\nLiving with breast cancer\nBeing diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways,\u00a0depending on what stage\u00a0it's at and what treatment you're having.\nHow women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example:\n\nyour\u00a0family and\u00a0friends can be a powerful support system\nyou can communicate with other people in the same situation\nfind out as much as possible about your condition\ndon't try to do too much or overexert yourself\nmake time for yourself\n\nRead more about living with breast cancer\n\n\nThe first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.\nMost\u00a0breast lumps (90%) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor.\nYou should speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:\n\na lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast\na change in the size or shape of one or both breasts\ndischarge from either of your nipples\u00a0(which may be streaked with blood)\na lump or swelling in either of your armpits\ndimpling on the skin of your breasts\na rash on or around your nipple\na change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast\n\nBreast pain alone isn't a symptom of breast cancer.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Changes to look and feel for\nCancer Research UK: Breast cancer symptoms\nMacmillan: What are the symptoms of breast cancer in women?\n\nBreast awareness\nIt's important to be breast aware,\u00a0so you can pick up any changes as soon as possible. Get to know what is normal for you. For instance, your breasts may look or feel different at different times of your life. This will make it much easier to spot\u00a0potential problems.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now:\u00a0Checking your breasts\nBreast Cancer Now:\u00a0Signs and symptoms of breast cancer\n\n\n\nThe causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, making it difficult to say why one woman may develop breast cancer and another may not.\nHowever, there are risk factors that are\u00a0known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some of these you can't do anything about, but there are some you can change.\nAge\nThe risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common among women over 50 who have been through the menopause. About 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50.\nAll women who are 50\u00a0to 70 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every 3 years as part of the NHS Breast Screening Programme. Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit.\nRead more about breast screening\nFamily history\nIf you have close relatives who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer, you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. However, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it's possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance.\nMost cases of breast cancer aren't hereditary (they don't run in families), but particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It's possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. A third gene (TP53) is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.\nIf you have, for example, 2 or more close relatives from the same side of your family, such as your mother, sister or daughter, who have had breast cancer under the age of 50, you may be eligible for surveillance for breast cancer or for genetic screening to look for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely. If you're worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your GP.\nRead about predictive genetic tests for cancer risk genes\nPrevious diagnosis of breast cancer\nIf you've previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast again.\nPrevious benign breast lump\nA\u00a0benign breast lump doesn't mean\u00a0you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may slightly increase your risk of developing it. Certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (cells growing abnormally in ducts), or lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells inside your breast lobes), can make getting breast cancer more likely.\nBreast density\nYour breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules), which produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser. Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous.\nDense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, because it makes any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue harder to spot. Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.\nExposure to oestrogen\nThe female hormone, oestrogen,\u00a0can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to\u00a0grow. The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start\u00a0puberty, to regulate your periods.\nYour risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen\u00a0your body is exposed to. For example, if you started your\u00a0periods at a young age and experienced the\u00a0menopause at a late age, you'll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time. In the same way, not having children, or having children later in life, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy.\nBeing overweight or obese\nIf you've experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer. This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, because being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.\nBeing tall\nIf you're taller than average, you're more likely to develop breast cancer than someone who's shorter than average.\u00a0The reason for this isn't fully understood, but it may be due to interactions between genes, nutrition and hormones.\nAlcohol\nYour risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink.\u00a0\nRadiation\nCertain medical procedures that use radiation, like X-rays\u00a0and computerised tomography (CT) scans, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer.\nIf you had\u00a0radiotherapy to your chest area for Hodgkin lymphoma\u00a0when you were a child, you should have already received a written invitation from the Department of Health for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer. Speak to your GP if you weren't contacted, or if you didn't attend a consultation.\nIf you currently need radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT)\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. Both combined HRT and oestrogen-only HRT can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined HRT.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Breast cancer causes\nMacmillan: Breast cancer causes and risk factors\n\n\n\nIf you have suspected breast cancer, either\u00a0because of\u00a0your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you'll be referred to a specialist breast clinic for further tests.\nWhat to expect at the breast clinic\nThe tests you'll receive at the breast clinic depend on your current symptoms, your age, and the results of the initial examination you'll have when you arrive. Many people don't need any further tests after the initial examination.\nMost of the time you can expect to spend up to 2 hours at the breast clinic.\nIf you have symptoms and have been referred by your GP, you'll meet a specialist who'll examine you to determine if you need further tests.\u00a0\nIf you're under\u00a040 years of age, the specialist\u00a0may suggest you only have a breast ultrasound scan. This is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn't as effective as an ultrasound\u00a0for diagnosing breast disease.\nIf you have a mammogram, it will produce an\u00a0X-ray of your breasts. You may also need an ultrasound scan.\nUltrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.\nRead more about breast screening\nA\u00a0biopsy is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it's cancerous. You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected.\nBiopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition.\u00a0Different methods of\u00a0carrying out\u00a0a biopsy are discussed below.\nNeedle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or to drain a benign cyst (a small fluid-filled lump). Your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue.\nNeedle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle. You'll have a local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.\nYour doctor may suggest that you have a guided needle biopsy (usually guided by ultrasound or X-ray, but sometimes MRI is used) to obtain a more precise and reliable diagnosis of cancer and to distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\nVacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as a mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy. During the procedure, a needle\u00a0is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to\u00a0obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now:\u00a0Referral to a breast clinic\nBreast Cancer Now: Your pathology report\nMacmillan: How breast cancer is diagnosed\n\nFurther tests for breast cancer\nIf a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and to work out the best method of treatment.\u00a0\nIf\u00a0your\u00a0cancer was detected through the NHS Breast Screening Programme, you'll have further tests in the screening centre before being referred for treatment.\u00a0\nComputerised tomography (CT) scans, or chest X-ray and liver ultrasound scans, may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to your lungs or liver. An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify or to assess the extent of the condition within the breast.\nIf your doctor thinks that the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan. Before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation, known as an isotope, will be injected into a vein in your arm. This will be absorbed into your bone if it's been affected by cancer. The affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera.\nYou'll also need tests that show whether the cancer will respond to specific types of treatment. The results of these tests can give your doctors a more complete picture of the type of cancer you have and how best to treat it. The types of test you could be offered are discussed below.\nIn some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone.\nIf this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones, or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. This is known as 'hormone therapy'.\nDuring\u00a0a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone. If the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells (using a hormone receptor), they're known as 'hormone receptor positive'.\nWhile hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called\u00a0human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).\nThese types of cancer can be diagnosed using a HER2 test, and treated with medication to block the effects of HER2. This is known as 'biological' or 'targeted' therapy.\nStage and grade of breast cancer\nWhen your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer:\n\nstage 1 \u2013 the tumour measures less than 2cm, the lymph nodes in the armpit aren't affected, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\nstage 2 \u2013 the tumour measures 2 to 5cm or the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\nstage 3 \u2013 the tumour measures\u00a02 to 5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues, the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected but\u00a0there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\nstage 4 \u2013 the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)\n\nThis is a simplified guide. Each stage is divided into further categories: A, B and C. If you're not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor.\nThe TNM staging system may also be used to describe breast cancer, as it can provide accurate information about the diagnosis. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\nThe grade describes the appearance of the cancer cells.\n\nlow grade (G1) \u2013 the cells, although abnormal, appear to be growing slowly\nmedium grade (G2) \u2013 the cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells\nhigh grade (G3) \u2013 the cells look even more abnormal and are more likely to grow quickly\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: TNM breast cancer staging\nCancer Research UK: Number stages of breast cancer\n\n\n\nSurgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer. The type of surgery you undergo will depend on the type of breast cancer you have.\nSurgery is usually followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. Again, the treatment you'll have will depend on\u00a0your type of breast cancer.\nYour doctor will discuss the most suitable treatment\u00a0plan with you. Chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.\nSecondary breast cancer\nMost breast cancers are discovered in the condition's early stages. However, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it's spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis).\nIf this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. Secondary cancer, also called 'advanced' or 'metastatic' cancer, isn't curable and treatment aims to achieve remission (where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full).\nRead further information about\u00a0secondary breast cancer\nSurgery\nThere are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery. They are:\n\nsurgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery\nsurgery to remove the whole breast, which is called a mastectomy\n\nIn many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed.\nStudies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.\nBreast-conserving surgery\nBreast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where\u00a0just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where\u00a0up to a quarter of the breast is removed.\nIf you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on the:\n\ntype of cancer you have\u00a0\nsize of the tumour and where it is in your breast\namount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed\nsize of your breasts\n\nYour surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. If there's no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there's less chance that the cancer will reoccur. If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast.\nAfter having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.\nMastectomy\nA mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy.\nIf the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm).\nReconstruction\nBreast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast.\nRead further information about\u00a0breast reconstruction\nLymph node surgery\nTo find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy\u00a0may be carried out.\nThe sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They're part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they're identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye.\nThe sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread.\nIf there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm.\nRead further information:\n\nPredict: Decide on the ideal course of treatment following breast cancer surgery\nCancer Research UK: Types of breast cancer surgery\n\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It's usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.\nIf you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. You'll probably have radiotherapy sessions 3 to 5 days a week, for 3 to 6 weeks. Each session will only last a few minutes.\nThe type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. The types available are:\u00a0\n\nbreast radiotherapy \u2013 after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue\nchest wall radiotherapy \u2013 after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall\nbreast boost \u2013 some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis)\nradiotherapy to the lymph nodes \u2013 where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes\n\nThe side effects of radiotherapy include:\n\nirritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nlymphoedema\u00a0(excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm)\n\nRead further information about\u00a0radiotherapy for breast cancer\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. It's usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven't been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.\nIn some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.\nSeveral different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. The choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it's spread.\nChemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means\u00a0you won't have to stay in hospital overnight. The medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein.\nIn some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. You may have chemotherapy sessions once every 2 to 3 weeks, over a period of 4 to 8 months, to give your body a rest in between treatments.\nThe main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. Side effects include:\n\ninfections\nloss of appetite\nnausea and vomiting\ntiredness\nhair loss\nsore mouth\n\nMany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.\nChemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers.\nIf you haven't experienced the menopause, your periods may\u00a0stop while you're undergoing chemotherapy treatment. After you've finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again.\nHowever, this doesn't always happen and you may enter an early menopause. This is more likely in women over 40 years old, because\u00a0they're closer to menopausal age. Your doctor will discuss with you the impact that any treatment will have on your fertility.\nChemotherapy for secondary breast cancer\nIf your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won't cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life.\nRead further information about\u00a0chemotherapy for breast cancer\nHormone treatment\nSome breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body.\nThese types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects.\nThe type of hormone therapy you'll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it's sensitive to, your age, whether you've experienced\u00a0the menopause and what other type of treatment you're having.\nYou'll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it's sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove.\nHormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you from having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nIn most cases, you'll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after\u00a0having surgery. If your breast cancer isn't sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.\nTamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It's taken every day as a tablet or liquid. It can cause several side effects, including:\n\ntiredness\nchanges to your periods\nnausea and vomiting\nhot flushes\naching joints\nheadaches\u00a0\nweight gain\n\nIf you've\u00a0experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor. This type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries.\nThree aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are\u00a0anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day. Side effects include:\n\nhot flushes and sweats\nlack of interest in sex (loss of libido)\nnausea and vomiting\ntiredness\naching joints and bone pain\nheadaches\nskin rashes\n\nIn women who haven't\u00a0experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen.\nAblation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. It\u00a0stops the ovaries working permanently and means you'll experience the menopause early.\nOvarian suppression involves using a medication called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa). Your periods will stop while you're taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete.\nIf you're\u00a0approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin.\nGoserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including:\n\nhot flushes and sweats\nmood swings\ntrouble sleeping\n\nRead further information about\u00a0hormone therapy\nBiological therapy (targeted therapy)\nSome breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are called HER2-positive. Biological therapy works by stopping the effects of HER2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells.\nIf you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you'll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Trastuzumab, also known by the brand name Herceptin,\u00a0is usually used after chemotherapy.\nTrastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are HER2-positive.\nTrastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. It's also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection).\nYou will have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour and the number of sessions you need will depend on whether you have early or more advanced breast cancer. On average, you'll need a session once every three weeks for early breast cancer, and weekly sessions if your cancer is more advanced.\nTrastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means that it's not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as angina, uncontrolled\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you'll have\u00a0regular tests on your heart to make sure it's not causing any problems.\nOther side effects of trastuzumab may include:\n\nan initial allergic reaction to the medication, which\u00a0can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\naches and pains\n\nClinical trials\nA great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment.\nThese advances were discovered in clinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.\nAll cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they're worthwhile and safely conducted. In fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those\u00a0in routine care.\nIf you're asked to take part in a trial, you'll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you'll be asked to sign a\u00a0consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Clinical trials\nAgainst Breast Cancer:\u00a0Our research\n\nPsychological help\nDealing with cancer can be a huge challenge, for both patients and their families. It can cause emotional and practical difficulties. Many women have to cope with the removal of part or all of a breast, which can be very upsetting.\nIt often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness.\nThere are various ways to find help and support. Your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor. If you're feeling depressed, talk to your GP. A course of antidepressant drugs may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist.\nIt can help to talk to someone who's been through the same thing as you. Many organisations have helplines and online forums. They can also put you in touch with other people who've had cancer treatment.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Someone to talk to\nMacmillan Cancer Support:\u00a0Online community\n\nComplementary therapies\nComplementary therapies are holistic therapies that can promote physical and emotional wellbeing. They're given alongside conventional treatments and include relaxation techniques, massage, aromatherapy and acupuncture.\nComplementary therapy\u00a0can help some women cope with diagnosis and treatment, and provide\u00a0a break\u00a0from the treatment plan.\nYour hospital or breast unit may be able to provide access to complementary therapies or suggest where you can\u00a0get them. It's important to speak to your breast cancer specialist nurse about any complementary therapy you wish to use, to make sure it doesn't\u00a0interfere with your conventional treatment.\nRead further information about\u00a0complementary therapies\n\n\nRecovery\nMost women with breast cancer have an operation as part of their treatment. Getting back to normal after surgery can take some time. It's important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover.\nDuring this time, avoid lifting things \u2013 for example, children or heavy shopping bags \u2013 and avoid heavy housework. You may also be advised not to drive.\nRead more about recovering from an operation\nSome other treatments, particularly radiotherapy\u00a0and chemotherapy, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don't\u00a0be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.\nFollow-up\nAfter your treatment has finished, you'll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every 3 months for the first year.\nIf you've had early breast cancer, your healthcare team will agree a care plan with you after your treatment has finished. This plan contains the details of your follow-up. You will receive a copy of the plan, which will also be sent to your GP.\nDuring the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may carry out\u00a0blood tests or\u00a0X-rays\u00a0to see how your cancer is responding to treatment. You should also be offered a mammogram every year for the first 5 years after your treatment.\nLong-term complications\nAlthough it's rare, your treatment for breast cancer may cause new problems, such as:\n\npain and stiffness in your arms and shoulders may occur after surgery, and the skin in these areas may be tight\nlymphoedema\u00a0(a build-up of excess lymph fluid which causes swelling) \u2013 this may occur\u00a0if surgery or radiotherapy damages the lymphatic drainage system in the armpit\n\nTalk to your healthcare team if you experience these or any other long-term effects of treatment.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now:\u00a0Life after breast cancer treatment\nBreast Cancer Now: Lymphoedema\nCancer Research UK: Breast cancer follow-up\n\nYour body and breasts after treatment\nA diagnosis of breast cancer may change how you think about your body. All women react differently to the bodily changes that happen as a result of breast cancer treatment. Some women react positively, but others find it more difficult to cope. It's important to give yourself time to come to terms with any changes to your body.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Coping emotionally\nHealthtalkonline: Body image\nMacmillan:\u00a0Cancer and body image\n\nAlthough most cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50 who have experienced\u00a0the menopause, some younger women have to cope with early menopause brought on by cancer treatment.\nSymptoms can include hot flushes, vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire.

After it's healed, you'll be offered a silicone prosthesis. Prostheses come in many different shapes and sizes, and you should be able to find one that suits you.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Your body after breast cancer treatment\nCancer Research UK: After your breast cancer surgery: your false breast shape (prosthesis)\n\nIf you didn't have immediate breast reconstruction (carried out at the time of a mastectomy), you can have reconstruction later. This is\u00a0called a delayed reconstruction.\nThere are 2 main methods of breast reconstruction \u2013 reconstruction using your own tissue and reconstruction using an implant. The type that's most suitable for you will depend on many factors, including the treatment you've had, any ongoing treatment and the size of your breasts. Talk to your healthcare team about which reconstruction is suitable for you.\nRead further information about\u00a0breast reconstruction\nRelationships with friends and family\nIt's not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you.\nBeing open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. However, don't be afraid to tell them that you need some time to yourself, if that's what you need.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Telling family and friends\nMacmillan: Talking about your cancer\nHealthtalkonline: How breast cancer affects families\n\nYour sex life\nBreast cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life. It's common for women to lose interest in sex after breast cancer treatment. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired. You may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer. You may be upset by the changes to your body or grieve the loss of your breasts or, in some cases, your fertility.\nIt's understandable that you may not feel like having sex while coping with all this. Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you have problems with sex that aren't getting better with time, you may want to speak to a counsellor or sex therapist.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Sex and intimacy\nCancer Research UK: Living with breast cancer surgery: sexuality after breast surgery\nMacmillan: Cancer and sexuality\n\nMoney and financial support\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially.\nIf you have cancer or you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support, for example:\n\nif you have a job but can't work because of your illness, you're entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\nif you don't have a job and can't work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\nif you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer\u2019s Allowance\nyou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or if you have a low household income\n\nFind out what help is available to you as soon as possible. The social worker at your hospital will be able to give you the information you need.\nTalk to other people\nYour GP or nurse may be able to answer any questions you have about your cancer or treatment. You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information on these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to other people who have\u00a0breast cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom.\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: Someone to talk to\nMacmillan: Online community\n\n\n\nAs the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not known if it can be prevented altogether.\nSome treatments are available to reduce the risk in women who have a higher risk of developing the condition than the general population.\nDiet and lifestyle\nRegular exercise\u00a0and a\u00a0healthy, balanced\u00a0diet are recommended for all women because they can help prevent many conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and many forms of cancer.\nRegular exercise can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. If you have been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.\nBreastfeeding\nStudies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don't. The reasons aren't fully understood, but it could be because women don't ovulate as regularly while they're\u00a0breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.\nTreatments to reduce your risk\nIf you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, treatment is available to reduce your risk.\nYour level of risk\u00a0is determined by factors such as your age, your family's medical history and the results of genetic tests.\nYou will usually be referred to a specialist genetics service if it's thought you have an increased risk of breast cancer.\u00a0Healthcare professionals working at these services\u00a0should discuss treatment options with you.\nThe 2 main treatments are surgery to remove the breasts (mastectomy) or medication.\nA\u00a0mastectomy is surgery to remove the breasts. It can be used\u00a0to treat breast cancer and reduce the chances of developing the condition in the small number of women from high-risk families.\nBy removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can\u00a0reduce\u00a0your risk of breast cancer by up to 90%.\nHowever, like all operations, there's a risk of complications, and having your breasts removed can have a significant effect on your body image and sexual relationships.\nIf you want to, you can usually choose\u00a0to have breast reconstruction either during the mastectomy operation, or at a later date. During breast reconstruction surgery, your original breast shape is recreated using either\u00a0breast implants or tissue from elsewhere in your body.\nAn alternative is to use\u00a0breast prostheses. These are\u00a0artificial breasts\u00a0that can be worn inside your bra.\nRead more about your body and your breasts after treatment\nIn 2013, the\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that 2 medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS\u00a0for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\nEither\u00a0tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who've been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven't.\nThese\u00a0medications may not be suitable if in the past you've had blood clots or\u00a0womb cancer, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future.\nWomen who've already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts\u00a0won't be offered these medications, because their risk of developing breast cancer is very small.\nA\u00a0course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.\nRaloxifene can cause side effects including\u00a0flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your\u00a0periods, and nausea and vomiting.\nYour chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increase while you're taking tamoxifen, so\u00a0you'll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots, so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before having any planned surgery.\nTamoxifen and raloxifene aren't currently licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased\u00a0risk of developing the condition. However, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks, and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.\nFor more information, read about preventive drugs for women at high risk of breast cancer\nRead further information:\n\nBreast Cancer Now: What can cause breast cancer\nCancer Research UK: Diet and preventing breast cancer\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it.\nIt's\u00a0much less common in men than women.\nThe cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts.\nHowever, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by\u00a0a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.\nBreast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge.\nRead more about the symptoms of male breast cancer\nWhen to speak to your GP\nYou should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge.\nWhile these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.\u00a0\nWhy it happens\nThe cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include:\n\nage \u2013 most cases affect men over the age of\u00a060\nhaving a family history of breast cancer (male or female)\nobesity\u00a0\u2013 a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more\n\nRead more about\u00a0causes of breast cancer in men\nTreating breast cancer in men\nIn most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually\u00a0a drug\u00a0called tamoxifen.\nTamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones\u00a0known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. It should help prevent the cancer returning.\nIn some cases, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used for the same purpose.\nRead more about treating breast cancer in men\nOutlook\nThe outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there's reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose.\nThe survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it's diagnosed.\nBreast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue.\nUnfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing breast cancer\u00a0in men.\nReducing your risk\nThe most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to:\n\ndrink alcohol in moderation\u00a0\nmaintain a healthy weight \u2013 through a combination of eating a\u00a0healthy diet and exercising regularly\n\nRead more about preventing cancer\n\n\nThe main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless.\nThe lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple).\nHowever, the vast majority of breast lumps are\u00a0caused by\u00a0a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.\nLess common symptoms of male breast cancer\u00a0include:\n\nthe nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction)\nthe nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration)\nfluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge)\n\nAdvanced symptoms\nAdditional symptoms usually only develop if the cancer spreads from the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. This is known as metastatic breast cancer.\nSymptoms of metastatic breast cancer include:\n\nbone pain\nswelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit\nshortness of breath\nfeeling unusually tired all the time\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nitchy skin\u00a0with\u00a0yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should always visit your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have\u00a0problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge.\u00a0\nThese problems\u00a0are unlikely to be of the result of breast cancer, but they\u00a0should be\u00a0investigated further.\n\n\nIt's not clear exactly what causes breast cancer in men, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.\nAge\nLike many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. Most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. It's rare for young men to\u00a0develop the condition.\nGenetics and family history\nA genetic mutation is\u00a0a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene.\u00a0The result is that\u00a0one or more of the body's processes may not work in the way they should.\nThere are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. The most significant mutation identified is known as the BRCA2 mutation.\u00a0\nThere's also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer,\u00a0such as a mother or sister.\nRoutine testing for the faulty genes that cause breast cancer in men isn't usually carried out on the NHS, unless specifically requested by a specialist. However,\u00a0some private clinics may offer gene testing. Tests can be expensive, with prices ranging from around \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000.\nOestrogen\nThere's evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men.\nCompared\u00a0with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. These include:\n\nhormone treatments \u2013 man-made (synthetic) versions of oestrogen are often used to treat prostate cancer, and are also given to transgender patients\u00a0undergoing a male to female sex change\nobesity \u2013 obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal\ncirrhosis \u2013 this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-term alcohol misuse\n\nThere is also a rare genetic condition affecting males called Klinefelter syndrome. This is a congenital condition that\u00a0boys are born with that means\u00a0those who are\u00a0affected\u00a0produce less of the hormone testosterone than usual.\nAs testosterone usually helps to limit the effect of oestrogen, men with Klinefelter syndrome are more likely to develop breast cancer than the general male population.\nOccupational risks\nThere's some evidence men who work in hot environments are twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with men who work in cooler environments.\nEnvironments linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in men include:\n\nblast furnaces\nsteelworks\nrolling mills \u2013 a factory where metal (usually steel) is shaped using rollers\ncar manufacturing plants\n\nOne hypothesis to help explain the link between working environment and the increased risk of developing breast cancer is that excessive heat may damage the testicles, which could lead to an increase in oestrogen levels.\nAnother hypothesis is that working in hot environments usually involves exposure to certain chemicals that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men.\nRates of breast cancer are also unusually high in men who manufacture perfumes and soaps. They are 7 times more likely to develop breast cancer than the male population at large.\nThe reason for this increased risk is still unclear. Exposure to certain chemicals seems to be an obvious possibility, but this hasn't yet been proven.\nRadiation\nExposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men.\nResearch has found men who received a course of radiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells\u00a0\u2013\u00a0directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared\u00a0with the population at large.\nHowever, even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low.\n\n\nIf you have symptoms of breast cancer, such as a hard, painless lump in one of your breasts, your GP will carefully examine you.\nDuring the examination, they'll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands).\nIt's likely your GP will refer you for further tests if there's a possibility you may have breast cancer.\u00a0\nMammogram\nA mammogram is a type of X-ray used to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer.\nDuring the mammogram procedure, a radiographer (a specialist in taking X-rays) will compress one of your breasts between two X-ray plates. This shouldn't be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable.\nOnce your breast has been correctly positioned, an X-ray will be taken that produces a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.\nUltrasound\nAn ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb.\nAn ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. The image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts.\nBiopsy\nA biopsy may be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts.\nA biopsy is a test that can either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of breast cancer in men. It involves taking a sample of suspected cancerous tissue and examining it in a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.\nA type of biopsy known as a core biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis of breast cancer in men. This type of biopsy can usually indicate whether the cancer has started to spread from the breast into the surrounding area.\nDuring a core biopsy, a local anaesthetic will be used to numb your breast. A hollow needle will then be used to remove a number of small tissue samples from the breast lump.\nIf cancer is found, it's also possible to check whether there are special proteins, known as oestrogen receptors, on the surface of the cancerous cells.\nThis is important, because if oestrogen receptors are found\u00a0\u2013 and they are in more than half\u00a0of cases\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it's possible to treat the cancer with hormone therapy.\nRead\u00a0treating breast cancer in men for more information.\nStaging\nAfter breast cancer has been diagnosed, your care team should provide information about the stage of the cancer. Staging is a system used to describe how far a cancer has spread at the point of diagnosis.\nA cure may be possible if breast cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. However, treatment can only be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer if it's diagnosed at a later stage. Unfortunately, more than 40% of breast cancers in men are diagnosed at a late stage.\nIn some cases, men are diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This means there are cancer cells in the breast, but they're contained within the breast ducts and can't spread.\nIf left untreated, DCIS can lead to invasive breast cancer over a period of time.\nCoping with a diagnosis\nBeing told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment.\nMost people assume breast cancer only affects women, so it can be difficult to come to terms with the diagnosis.\nFeelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. This may be because there's little in the way of advice and support for men with breast cancer, particularly when compared\u00a0with the support available for women with the condition.\nSometimes men who find themselves in this situation can become depressed. You may be depressed if you've felt very down and no longer interested in doing activities you used to enjoy\u00a0during the past month.\nIf you think you may be depressed, visit your GP. There is a range of effective treatments, such as medication and counselling, that can help relieve feelings of depression.\nYou may also find it useful to talk to other men affected by the condition. Breast Cancer Now is a breast cancer charity that provides an online forum for anyone diagnosed with breast cancer. Cancer Research UK also provides Cancer Chat, an online forum for anyone affected by cancer.\nScreening for breast cancer in men\nAs breast cancer is\u00a0rare in\u00a0men, routine screening for the condition isn't recommended, even for men in high-risk groups, such as those with a family history of breast cancer or those who have had radiotherapy.\n\n\nTreatment for breast cancer in men largely depends on how far the cancer has spread.\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat men with breast cancer. These are teams of specialists\u00a0who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nDeciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the ideal treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you'd like to ask the specialist. For example, you could ask about\u00a0the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nYour treatment plan\nYour recommended treatment plan depends on how far the cancer has spread. If the cancer hasn't spread significantly beyond your breast, a complete cure may be possible.\nIn these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. This is often followed by radiotherapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy to help prevent the cancer returning.\nIf the cancer has spread beyond your breast into other parts of your body, such as your lungs, a complete cure won't be possible. However, hormone therapy and chemotherapy can be used to relieve symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer.\nMore information about these treatments can be found below.\nSurgery\nAn operation called a mastectomy is usually recommended as the first treatment for breast cancer.\nA mastectomy involves removing the entire breast,\u00a0sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. A procedure known as a\u00a0sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed.\nIn some cases, part of the muscle under the breast may also be removed if there's a risk the cancer has spread to this area.\nOnce surgery has been completed, there will be a straight scar across your chest where your nipple used to be and possibly an indentation around the area where the breast tissue used to be.\nMost men are well enough to leave hospital 1 to 3 days after surgery.\nAfter the operation, it's likely you'll feel very tired and it may take a few weeks before you're well enough to start carrying out relatively strenuous activities, such as lifting objects or driving. Your specialist nurse will be able to offer more specific advice about this.\nThe wound takes about 2 to 3 weeks to heal. It's important to keep the wound clean during this time.\nYou should look for any signs that the wound may have become infected, such as redness and swelling around the wound or a discharge of pus. Inform your MDT as soon as possible if you suspect an infection.\nIt's difficult to predict when you'll feel able to return to work. Some people choose to remain off work until other treatments, such as radiotherapy, have been completed.\nOthers prefer to return to work in between treatments. Your MDT will be able to advise you, but the final decision will be yours.\nIt can take several weeks to fully recover from the effects of a mastectomy. A structured exercise programme, where the intensity and amount of time spent exercising is gradually increased, will probably be recommended.\nYour\u00a0treatment team\u00a0will be able to provide you with more advice or refer you to a physiotherapist (a specialist with training in rehabilitation using exercise).\nAfter\u00a0surgery, you may experience numbness or tingling at the site of the scar and in your upper arm. This is common, and is\u00a0caused by nerve damage during surgery.\nThe numbness and tingling should pass within a few weeks or months, although it can occasionally be permanent.\nAnother\u00a0possible complication is painful swelling in the arms. This is called lymphoedema, which is caused by the disruption of the lymphatic system (a series of channels and lymph nodes normally responsible for removing excess fluid from tissue).\nIf many lymph nodes are surgically removed, it can disrupt the lymphatic system's ability to drain fluid, which can lead to swelling.\nThere's no cure for lymphoedema, but it's possible to control the symptoms using a combination of different techniques, such as massage and compression garments.\nSee treating lymphoedema\u00a0for more information\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy is a type of treatment involving a machine that releases high-energy waves to destroy cancerous cells. It can be given a few weeks after surgery to prevent the cancerous cells returning.\nA typical course of radiotherapy involves 2 to 5 sessions a week over the course of 3 to 6 weeks. The sessions are short and usually only last for 10 to 15 minutes.\nRadiotherapy isn't usually painful, although you'll probably experience some side effects. This is because the energy released during radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells.\nCommon side effects of radiotherapy can include:\n\nextreme tiredness (fatigue)\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nsore, red and irritated skin on the breast similar in appearance to sunburn\n\nThe side effects of radiotherapy should pass after your course of treatment has finished, although some men experience prolonged fatigue for several months.\nRadiotherapy can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve the symptoms of pain. This is known as palliative radiotherapy.\nPalliative radiotherapy is usually given in just 1 or 2 doses and doesn't usually cause any side effects.\nHormone therapy\nUp to\u00a090% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive, or ER+. 'E' is used because the American spelling of oestrogen is 'estrogen'.\nThis means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow. Oestrogen is a type of hormone found in low levels in men and much higher levels in women.\nThe aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. It can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer.\nTamoxifen is\u00a0one of the hormone-blocking\u00a0medications widely used for breast cancer. It's available in tablet or liquid form, and prevents oestrogen entering the breast tissue cells.\nThe ideal length of treatment with tamoxifen is unclear. Studies in women with breast cancer suggest a five-year course of treatment is the most effective for preventing the return of cancer and extending survival rates. However, it's unclear if this also applies to men.\nTamoxifen can also cause unpleasant side effects, which will be taken into consideration when your\u00a0treatment team\u00a0is deciding which treatments to recommend. You can discuss the pros and cons of long-term treatment with tamoxifen with your doctors.\nSide effects of tamoxifen can\u00a0include:\n\nreduced interest in sex (loss of\u00a0libido)\ninability to obtain or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)\nheadache\nfeeling sick\u00a0\u2013\u00a0taking your medication with food may help reduce this side effect\nchanges in mood, such as feeling irritable or depressed\n\nYou should inform your\u00a0team if you experience side effects that become particularly troublesome, as alternative medications are available.\nAromatase inhibitors are an alternative\u00a0type of hormone medication. They may be used if tamoxifen proves unsuccessful or the side effects of tamoxifen are particularly troublesome. Aromatase inhibitors can also be used to slow the spread of advanced breast cancer.\nIn men, oestrogen is created when a protein called aromatase converts another hormone called androgens. Aromatase inhibitors block the effects of aromatase, which in turn lowers the amount of oestrogen in the body.\nAromatase inhibitors are usually given in tablet form and taken daily for two to five years. As with tamoxifen, there's little available evidence about the most effective length of dosage in men, compared with female breast cancer.\nSide effects of aromatase inhibitors can include:\n\njoint pain\nlack of energy\nhot flushes\nskin rashes\nfeeling sick\nbeing sick\nthinning of the hair\n\nHowever, it's unlikely you'll experience any or all of these side effects.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive (ER+).\nIt's usually given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning, or it's used to treat the symptoms of incurable cancer.\nChemotherapy for breast cancer involves taking a combination of cancer-killing medications. Treatment is usually given every 2 to\u00a03\u00a0 weeks over the course of 6 months.\nYou may be given chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy), chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy), or a combination of both.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy can include:\n\nfeeling sick\nbeing sick\ndiarrhoea \nloss of appetite\nmouth ulcers\ntiredness\nskin rashes\ninfertility\nhair loss\n\nThe side effects should resolve once your treatment has finished.\u00a0Your hair should grow back about 3 to 6 months\u00a0after treatment.\nChemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It's important to\u00a0tell your MDT about\u00a0any symptoms of a potential infection, such as:\n\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\nflu-like symptoms, such as chills or joint pain\na general sense of feeling unwell\n\nYou should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection.\nIf you're sexually active, you should use a condom for 48 hours after receiving a dose of chemotherapy medication. This is because the medication used in chemotherapy could pass into your semen and cause irritation in the tissue of your partner's genitals.\nYou should avoid having children while receiving chemotherapy as many of the medications can damage your sperm and increase your chances of having a baby with a birth defect. Again, using a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, is recommended\nDepending on the medications used, it may be several months after your course of chemotherapy has ended before you can safely have children. Your MDT will be able to give you a more detailed recommendation.\nBiological therapy\nBiological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cases where HER2 is contributing to breast cancer.\nBiological therapies are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they are designed to target biological processes that cancers rely on to grow and reproduce.\nIf you have high levels of the HER2 protein and\u00a0are able to have biological therapy, you'll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab.\u00a0Also known by the brand name Herceptin, it\u00a0is usually used after radiotherapy or chemotherapy to prevent cancerous cells returning.\nTrastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in the body and are created by the immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells designed to respond to the HER2 protein.\nTrastuzumab is given through a drip, directly into a vein (intravenously). You'll receive the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to 1 hour, and the number of sessions you need depends on whether your breast cancer is in its early or more advanced stages.\nOn average, for early breast cancer you'll need to have a session once every 3 weeks, and for more advanced cancer you'll need to have weekly sessions.\nTrastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means it's not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as angina, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), or heart valve disease.\nIf you need to take trastuzumab, you'll need to have regular tests on your heart to ensure it's not causing any problems.\nOther side effects of trastuzumab\u00a0can include:\n\nan initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\naches and pains\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Bronchiectasis is a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptoms of bronchiectasis include:\n\na persistent\u00a0cough that usually brings up phlegm (sputum)\nbreathlessness\n\nThe severity of symptoms can vary widely. Some people have only a few symptoms that don't appear often, while others have wide-ranging daily\u00a0symptoms.\nThe symptoms tend to get worse if you develop an infection in your lungs.\nRead more about the symptoms of bronchiectasis.\nWhen to see your GP\nYou should see your GP if you develop a persistent cough. While this may not be\u00a0caused by\u00a0bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation.\nIf your GP suspects you may have bronchiectasis, they'll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further tests.\nRead more about diagnosing bronchiectasis.\nHow the lungs are affected\nThe lungs are full of tiny branching airways, known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream.\nThe inside walls of the bronchi are coated with sticky mucus, which protects against damage from particles moving down into the lungs.\nIn bronchiectasis, one or more of the bronchi are abnormally widened. This means more mucus than usual gathers there, which makes the bronchi more vulnerable to infection. If an infection does develop, the bronchi may be damaged again, so even more mucus gathers in them, and the risk of infection increases further.\nOver time, this cycle can cause gradually worsening damage to the lungs.\nWhy it happens\nBronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed.\u00a0\nThere are many reasons why this may happen. The three most common causes in the UK\u00a0are:\n\na\u00a0lung infection during childhood, such as pneumonia or whooping cough, that damages the bronchi\nunderlying problems with the immune system (the body\u2019s defence against infection) that make the bronchi more vulnerable to damage from an infection\nallergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) \u2013 an allergy to a certain type of fungi that can cause the bronchi to become inflamed if spores from the fungi\u00a0are inhaled\n\nHowever, in many cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause for the condition can be found (known as idiopathic bronchiectasis).\nRead more about the causes of bronchiectasis.\nWho is affected\nBronchiectasis is thought to be uncommon. It's estimated that around 1 in every 1,000 adults in the UK have the condition.\nIt can affect anyone at any age, but\u00a0symptoms don't usually develop until middle age.\nOver 12,000\u00a0people\u00a0were admitted\u00a0to hospital in England during 2013-14 with bronchiectasis. The majority of these\u00a0people were over 60 years old.\nHow bronchiectasis is treated\nThe damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help relieve your symptoms and stop the damage getting worse.\nThe main treatments include:\n\nexercises and special devices\u00a0to help you clear mucus out of your\u00a0lungs\nmedication to help improve airflow within the lungs\nantibiotics to treat any lung infections that develop\n\nSurgery\u00a0is usually only considered for bronchiectasis in rare cases where other treatments haven't been effective, the damage to your bronchi is confined to a small area and you're in good general health.\nRead more about the treatment of bronchiectasis.\nPossible complications\nComplications of bronchiectasis are rare, but they can be serious. One of the most serious complications is coughing up large amounts of blood, caused\u00a0by one of the blood vessels in the lungs splitting. This problem can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery to treat it.\nRead more about the complications of bronchiectasis.\nOutlook\nThe outlook for people with bronchiectasis is highly variable and often depends on the underlying cause.\nLiving with bronchiectasis can be stressful and frustrating, but most people with the condition have a normal life expectancy. For people with very severe symptoms, however, bronchiectasis can be fatal if the lungs stop working properly.\nAround 1,000 deaths reported in England and Wales each year are thought to be\u00a0caused by\u00a0bronchiectasis.\nIf you have\u00a0bronchiectasis, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register.\n\n\nThe most common symptom of bronchiectasis is a persistent cough that brings up a large amount of phlegm on a daily basis.\nThe phlegm\u00a0can be clear, pale yellow or yellow-greenish in colour. Other people\u00a0may only occasionally\u00a0cough up small amounts of phlegm, or none at all.\nOther symptoms may include:\n\nshortness of breath\nwheezing\ncoughing up blood or blood-stained phlegm\nchest pain\njoint pain\nclubbing of the fingertips \u2013 the tissue beneath the nail thickens and the fingertips become rounded and bulbous\n\nSigns of a lung infection\nIf you\u00a0develop a lung infection, your symptoms usually get worse\u00a0within a few days. This is known as an infective exacerbation and it can cause:\n\ncoughing up even more\u00a0phlegm, which may be\u00a0more green than usual\u00a0or smell unpleasant\nworsening shortness of breath\n\nYou may also:\n\nfeel very tired\ncough up blood, if you haven't already done so\nexperience a sharp chest pain that's made worse when breathing (pleurisy)\nfeel generally unwell\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you haven't previously been\u00a0diagnosed with bronchiectasis and you develop a persistent cough, visit your GP for advice.\nWhile persistent coughing may not necessarily be the result of bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation.\nIf you've been previously diagnosed with bronchiectasis and you begin to experience symptoms that suggest you have a lung infection, contact your GP. You'll usually need treatment with antibiotics.\nSome people with bronchiectasis are given a stock of antibiotics as a precaution, in case they suddenly develop a lung infection.\nWhen to seek immediate medical advice\nSome people with bronchiectasis develop a severe lung infection that may need to be treated in hospital.\nSigns and symptoms of serious lung infection include:\n\na bluish tinge to the\u00a0skin and lips (cyanosis)\nconfusion\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\nrapid breathing (more than 25 breaths\u00a0a minute)\nsevere chest pain that makes it too painful to cough and clear your lungs\n\nIf you experience any of the above, phone the healthcare professional in charge of your care immediately. This may be your GP, a doctor who specialises in lung conditions (pulmonologist) or a specialist nurse.\nIf this isn't possible, then phone the NHS 24 111 service\u00a0or your local out-of-hours service.\n\n\nBronchiectasis is caused by the airways of the lungs becoming damaged and widened. This can be due to an infection or another condition. Sometimes, the cause is not known.\nYour lungs are continually exposed to germs, so\u00a0your body has sophisticated defence mechanisms designed to keep the lungs free of infection.\nIf\u00a0a foreign substance (such as bacteria or a virus) gets past these defences, your immune system will attempt to stop the spread of any infection by sending white blood cells to the location of the infection. These cells release chemicals to fight the infection, which can cause the\u00a0surrounding tissue to become inflamed.\nFor most people, this inflammation will pass without causing any further problems. However, bronchiectasis can occur if the inflammation permanently destroys the elastic-like tissue and muscles surrounding the bronchi (airways), causing them to widen.\nThe abnormal bronchi then become filled with excess mucus, which can trigger persistent coughing and make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. If the lungs do become infected again, this\u00a0can result in further inflammation and further widening of the bronchi.\nAs this cycle is repeated, the damage to the lungs gets progressively worse. How quickly bronchiectasis progresses can vary significantly. For some people, the condition will get worse quickly, but for many the progression is slow.\nCommon\u00a0causes\nIn around half of all cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause can be found.\u00a0\nSome of the more\u00a0common triggers that have been identified are described below.\nAround a third of cases of bronchiectasis in adults are associated with a severe lung infection in childhood, such as:\n\nsevere pneumonia\nwhooping cough\u00a0\ntuberculosis (TB)\u00a0\nmeasles\n\nHowever, as there are now vaccinations available for these infections, it is expected that childhood infections will become a less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future.\nAround 1 in 12 cases of bronchiectasis occur because a person has a weakened immune system, which makes their lungs more vulnerable to tissue damage. The medical term for having a weakened immune system is immunodeficiency.\nSome people are born with an immunodeficiency because of problems with the genes they inherit from their parents. It's also possible to acquire an immunodeficiency\u00a0after an infection such as HIV.\nAround 1 in 14 people with bronchiectasis develop the condition as a complication of an allergic condition known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).\nPeople with ABPA have an allergy to a type of fungi known as aspergillus, which is found in a wide range of different environments across the world.\nIf a person with ABPA breathes in fungal spores, it can trigger an allergic reaction and persistent inflammation, which in turn can progress to bronchiectasis.\u00a0\u00a0\nAspiration is the medical term for stomach contents accidentally passing into your lungs, rather than down into your gastrointestinal tract. This is responsible for around 1 in 25 cases of bronchiectasis.\nThe lungs are very sensitive to the presence of foreign objects, such as small samples of food or even stomach acids, so this can trigger inflammation leading to bronchiectasis.\nCystic fibrosis is a relatively common genetic disorder, where the lungs become clogged up with mucus. The mucus then provides an ideal environment for a bacterial infection to take place, leading to the symptoms of bronchiectasis.\nIt is estimated that cystic fibrosis is responsible for around 1 in 33 cases of bronchiectasis.\nCilia are the tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways in the lungs. They are designed to protect the airways and help move away any excess mucus. Bronchiectasis can develop if there is a problem with the cilia that means they are unable to effectively clear mucus from the airways.\nConditions that can cause problems with the cilia include:\n\nYoung's disease \u2013 a rare condition only affecting males that is thought to be caused by exposure to mercury in childhood\nprimary ciliary dyskinesia \u2013 a rare condition caused by inheriting faulty genes\n\nIt's estimated that about 1 in every 33 cases of bronchiectasis are caused by Young's disease and 1 or 2 in every 100 cases are caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia.\nHowever, as the regulations regarding the use of mercury are now much stricter than they were in the past, it is expected that Young\u2019s syndrome will become a much less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\nCertain conditions that cause inflammation in other areas of the body are sometimes associated with bronchiectasis, including:\n\nrheumatoid arthritis\nSj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nCrohn's disease\u00a0\nulcerative colitis\n\nThese conditions are usually thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, where it mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.\n\n\nYou should see your GP for advice if you develop a persistent cough, so they can look for a possible cause.\nYour GP will ask you about your symptoms, such as how often you cough, whether you bring up any phlegm (sputum) and whether you smoke.\nThey may also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope as you breathe in and out. The lungs of people with bronchiectasis often make a distinctive crackling noise as a person breaths in and out.\nYou'll also probably\u00a0have a chest X-ray\u00a0to rule out other, more serious, causes of your symptoms, such as lung cancer.\nIf your GP thinks you may have a lung infection, they may take a sample of your phlegm, so it can be checked for bacteria.\nReferral to a specialist\nIf your GP suspects you could have bronchiectasis, you'll be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further testing.\nThe maximum time you should have to wait for referral is 18 weeks, although you may not have to wait as long as this.\nRead more about waiting times.\nSome of the tests a respiratory consultant may carry out to help diagnose bronchiectasis are described below.\nCurrently, the most effective test available to diagnose bronchiectasis is called a high-resolution computerised tomography\u00a0(HRCT) scan.\nA HRCT scan involves taking several X-rays of your chest at slightly different angles.\u00a0A computer is then used to put all the images together. This produces a very detailed picture of the inside of your body and the airways inside your lungs (the bronchi) should show up very clearly.\nIn a healthy pair of lungs, the bronchi should become narrower the further they spread into your lungs, in the same way a tree branch separates into narrower branches and twigs.\nIf the scan shows that a section of airways is actually getting wider, this usually confirms bronchiectasis.\nOther tests can be used to assess the state of your lungs and to try to determine what the underlying cause of your bronchiectasis may be.\nThese tests may include:\n\nblood tests \u2013 to check how well your immune system is working and check for infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi\nphlegm (sputum) test\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to check for bacteria or fungi\na sample of your sweat can be tested to see how much salt is in it \u2013 high levels of salt can be caused by cystic fibrosis (if this test is positive, then a more detailed genetic test can be carried out; see diagnosing cystic fibrosis for further information)\nlung\u00a0function test \u2013 a small, hand-held device (spirometer) that you blow into is used to measure how hard and how quickly you can expel air from your lungs; this can assess how well your lungs are working\nbronchoscopy \u2013 a flexible tube with a camera at one end is used to look into your lungs; this is usually only required if you think you've\u00a0inhaled\u00a0a foreign object\n\n\n\nThe damage to the lungs associated with bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help prevent the condition getting worse.\nIn most cases, treatment involves a combination of medication, exercises you can learn and devices to help clear your airways. Surgery for bronchiectasis is rare.\nThere are a number of things you can do to help relieve the symptoms of bronchiectasis and stop the condition getting worse, including:\n\nstopping smoking (if you smoke)\nhaving the flu vaccine every year\nmaking sure you have had the pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumonia\nexercising regularly\nkeeping yourself well hydrated\neating a balanced diet\n\nExercises\nThere are a range of exercises, known as airway clearance techniques, which can help to remove mucus from your lungs. This can often help improve coughing and breathlessness in people with bronchiectasis.\nYou can be referred to a\u00a0physiotherpist, who can teach you these techniques.\nThe most widely used technique in the UK is called active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT).\nACBT involves you repeating a cycle made up of a number of different steps. These include a period of normal breathing, followed by deep breaths to loosen the mucus and force it up; then you cough the mucus out. The cycle is then repeated for 20 to 30 minutes.\nDon't attempt ACBT if you haven't first been taught the steps by a suitably trained physiotherapist, as performing the techniques incorrectly could damage your lungs.\nIf you're otherwise in good health, you'll probably only need to perform ACBT once or twice a day. If you develop a lung infection, you may need to perform ACBT on a more frequent basis.\nChanging your position can also make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs. This is known as postural drainage.\nEach technique can involve several complex steps, but most techniques involve you leaning or lying down while the physiotherapist or a carer uses their hands to vibrate certain sections of your lungs as you go through a series of \"huffing\" and coughing.\nDevices\nThere are also a number of handheld devices that can help to remove mucus from your lungs.\nAlthough these devices look different, most work in a similar way. Generally, they use a combination of vibrations and air pressure to make it easier to cough out any mucus.\nExamples of these devices\u00a0include the flutter, the RC cornet and the Acapella.\nHowever, these devices aren't always available on the NHS, so you may have to pay for one yourself. They usually cost \u00a345 to \u00a360.\nMedication\nIn some cases, medications to make breathing or clearing your lungs easier may be prescribed. These are discussed below.\nOccasionally, medication inhaled through a device called a nebuliser may be recommended to help make it easier for you to clear your lungs.\nNebulisers are devices consisting of a face mask or mouthpiece, a chamber to convert the medication into a fine mist, and a compressor to pump the medication into your lungs.\nA number of different medications can be administered using a nebuliser, including salt water solutions. These medications help to reduce the thickness of your phlegm so it's easier to cough it out. Nebulisers can also be used to administer antibiotics, if necessary (see below).\nHowever, while the medications used with a nebuliser can be provided on prescription, the nebuliser device itself isn't always available on the NHS. In some areas, a local respiratory service may provide the device without charge, but if this isn't an option, you may have to pay for a device.\nIf you have a particularly severe flare-up of symptoms, you may be prescribed bronchodilator medications on a short-term basis.\nBronchodilators are inhaled medications that help make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs. Examples of this type of medication include beta2-adrenergic agonist, anticholinergics and theophylline.\nAntibiotics\nIf you experience a worsening of symptoms because of a bacterial infection (known as an \"infective exacerbation\") then you'll need to be treated with antibiotics.\nA sample of phlegm will be taken to determine what type of bacteria is causing the infection, although you'll be initially treated with an antibiotic known to be effective against a number of different bacteria (a broad spectrum antibiotic) because\u00a0it can take a few days to get the test results.\nDepending on the test results, you may be prescribed a different antibiotic, or in some cases, a combination of antibiotics known to be effective against the specific bacteria causing the infection.\nIf you're well enough to be treated at home, you'll probably be prescribed two to three antibiotic tablets a day for 10-14 days. It's important to finish the course even if you feel better, as stopping the course prematurely could cause the infection to recur quickly.\nIf your symptoms are more severe (see\u00a0symptoms of bronchiectasis for a detailed description) you may need to be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotic injections.\nIf you have three or more infective exacerbations in any one year, or your symptoms during an infective exacerbation were particularly severe, it may be recommended that you take antibiotics on a long-term basis. This can help to prevent further infections and give your lungs the chance to recover.\nThis could involve taking low-dose antibiotic tablets to minimise the risk of side effects, or using an antibiotic nebuliser (see above for more information about nebulisers).\nUsing antibiotics in this way does increase the risk that one or more types of bacteria will develop a resistance to the antibiotic. Therefore, you may be asked to give regular phlegm samples to check for any resistance. If bacteria do show signs of developing a resistance, then your antibiotic may need to be changed.\nSurgery\nSurgery is usually only recommended where bronchiectasis is only affecting a single section of your lung, your symptoms aren't responding to other treatment and you don't have an underlying condition that could cause bronchiectasis to recur.\nThe lungs are made up of sections known as lobes \u2013 the left lung has two lobes and the right lung has three lobes. Surgery for focal bronchiectasis would usually involve removing the lobe affected by the bronchiectasis in a type of operation known as a lobectomy.\nSurgery won't be used if more than one lobe is affected, as it\u2019s too dangerous to remove so much lung tissue.\n\n\nIn some cases, people with bronchiectasis can develop serious complications that require emergency treatment.\nCoughing up large amounts of blood\nA rare, but serious, complication of bronchiectasis is coughing up large amounts of blood (the medical term for this is massive haemoptysis). This can occur when a section of one of the blood vessels supplying the lungs suddenly splits open.\nSymptoms that may indicate massive haemoptysis include:\n\ncoughing up more than 100ml of blood in a 24-hour period \u2013 100ml is roughly equivalent to a third of a can of drink\nbreathing difficulties \u2013 caused by blood obstructing your airways\nfeeling lightheaded, dizzy and having cold, clammy skin \u2013 caused by rapid blood loss\n\nMassive haemoptysis is a medical emergency. If you think someone\u00a0is experiencing massive haemoptysis, then phone 999 for an ambulance.\nA person with massive haemoptysis needs to be admitted to hospital and a tube may need to be placed into their throat to assist them with their breathing.\nA procedure called a bronchial artery embolisation (BAE), carried out by specialist radiology doctors, will then be required to stop the bleeding. During a BAE, a special dye is injected into your arteries so they show up clearly on X-rays.\nThen, using X-ray scans as a guide, the source of the bleeding is located and injected with tiny particles, around the size of a grain of sand, that will help clog the vessel\u00a0up and stop the bleeding.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Bronchitis is an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchi), causing them to become irritated and inflamed.\nThe main symptom is a cough, which may bring up yellow-grey mucus (phlegm). Bronchitis may also cause a\u00a0sore throat\u00a0and wheezing.\nRead more about the symptoms of bronchitis.\nWhen to see your GP\nMost cases of bronchitis can be treated easily at home with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and plenty of fluids.\nYou only need to see your GP if your symptoms are severe or unusual \u2013 for example, if:\n\nyour cough is severe or lasts longer than three weeks\nyou have a constant fever\u00a0(a temperature of 38\u00b0C\u00a0\u2013\u00a0100.4\u00b0F\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or above) for more than three days\nyou cough up mucus streaked with blood\nyou have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as\u00a0asthma or\u00a0heart failure\n\nYour GP may need to rule out other lung infections, such as pneumonia, which has symptoms similar to those of bronchitis. If your GP thinks you may have pneumonia, you will probably need a chest X-ray, and a sample of mucus may be taken for testing.\nIf your GP thinks you might have an undiagnosed underlying condition, they may also suggest a pulmonary function test. You will be asked to take a deep breath and blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures the volume of air in your lungs. Decreased lung capacity can indicate an underlying health problem.\nTreating bronchitis\nIn most cases, bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without the need for treatment. This type of bronchitis is known as \"acute bronchitis\". While you are waiting for it to pass, you should drink lots of fluid and get plenty of rest.\nIn some cases, the symptoms of bronchitis can last much longer. If symptoms last for at least three months, it is known as \"chronic bronchitis\". There is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but there are several medications to help relieve symptoms. It is also important to avoid smoking and smoky environments, as this can make your symptoms worse.\nRead more about treating bronchitis.\nWhy do I have bronchitis?\nThe bronchi are the main airways in your lungs, which branch off on either side of your windpipe (trachea). They lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs, known as bronchioles.\nThe walls of the bronchi produce mucus to trap dust and other particles that could otherwise cause irritation.\nMost cases of acute bronchitis\u00a0develop when an infection causes the bronchi to become irritated and inflamed, which causes them to produce more mucus than usual. Your body tries to shift this extra mucus through coughing.\nSmoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis. Over time, tobacco smoke can cause permanent damage to the bronchi, causing them to become inflamed.\nRead more about the causes of bronchitis.\nComplications\nPneumonia is the most common complication of bronchitis. It\u00a0happens when the\u00a0infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid.\u00a01 in 20 cases of bronchitis leads to pneumonia.\nPeople at an increased risk of developing pneumonia include:\n\nelderly people\npeople who smoke\npeople with other health conditions, such as heart, liver or kidney disease\npeople with a weakened immune system\n\nMild pneumonia can usually be treated with antibiotics at home. More severe cases may require admission to hospital.\nRead more about the treatment of pneumonia.\nWho is affected\nAcute bronchitis is one of the most common types of lung infection, and is one of the top five reasons for GP visits.\nAcute bronchitis can affect people of all ages, but is most common in younger children under the age of five. It is more common in winter, and often develops following a cold,\u00a0sore throat or flu.\nIt is estimated that there are around 2 million people in the UK affected by chronic bronchitis. Most of these are adults over the age of 50.\n\n\nThe main symptom of bronchitis is a hacking cough. It is likely that your cough will bring up thick yellow-grey mucus (phlegm), although this does not always happen.\nOther symptoms of bronchitis are similar to those of other infections, such as the common cold or sinusitis, and may include:\n\nsore throat\nheadache\nrunny or blocked nose\naches and pains\ntiredness\n\nIf you have bronchitis,\u00a0your cough may last for several weeks after other symptoms have gone. You may also find that the continual coughing makes your chest and stomach muscles sore.\nSome people may experience shortness of breath\u00a0or wheezing, due to inflamed airways. However, this is more common with long-term (chronic) bronchitis.\nLong-term (chronic) bronchitis\nChronic bronchitis is often known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nThe symptoms of COPD can include:\n\nwheezing\nincreasing breathlessness when exercising or moving around\na persistent cough that brings up mucus (phlegm)\nfrequent chest infections\n\nThe symptoms are often worse in the winter, and it is common to have two or more flare-ups a year. A flare-up is when your symptoms are particularly bad.\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP as soon as possible if:\n\nyour cough is very severe or lasts longer than three weeks\nyou have a constant fever (a temperature of 38\u00b0C \u2013 100.4\u00b0F \u2013 or above) for more than three days \u2013 this may be a sign of flu or a more serious condition, such as pneumonia\nyou cough up mucus streaked with blood\nyou develop rapid breathing (more than 30 breaths a minute) or chest pains\nyou become drowsy or confused\nyou have had repeated bouts of bronchitis\n\nYou should also contact your GP if you have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as:\n\nasthma\nheart failure \u2013 weakness in the heart that leads to fluid in your lungs\nemphysema \u2013 damage to the small airways in your lungs\n\n\n\nThe bronchitis infection can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, although viral bronchitis is much more common.\nIn most cases, bronchitis is caused by the same viruses that cause the\u00a0common cold or flu. The virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone coughs or sneezes.\nThese droplets typically spread about 1m (3ft). They hang suspended in the air for a while, then land on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to\u00a024 hours. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus further by touching something else.\nEveryday items at home and in public places, such as door handles and keyboards,\u00a0may have traces of the virus on them. People usually become infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects, and then placing their hands near their nose or mouth. It is also possible to breathe in the virus if it is suspended in airborne droplets.\nBreathing in\u00a0irritant substances\nBronchitis can also be triggered by breathing in irritant substances, such as smog, chemicals in household products or tobacco smoke.\nSmoking is the main cause of long-term (chronic) bronchitis, and it can affect people who inhale second-hand smoke, as well as smokers themselves.\nRead information about treatments to quit smoking.\nOccupational exposure\nYou may also be at risk of bronchitis and other forms of\u00a0chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if you are often exposed to materials that can damage your lungs, such as:\n\ngrain dust\ntextiles (fabric fibres)\nammonia\nstrong acids\nchlorine\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as 'occupational bronchitis', and usually eases once you are no longer exposed to the irritant substance.\nRead more information about the causes of COPD.\nYou can also read\u00a0the\u00a0Health and Safety Executive's report on COPD in Great Britain\u00a0attributed to occupational exposure (PDF, 275 KB).\n\n\nMost cases of bronchitis do not require treatment from a GP, and the symptoms can be easily managed at home.\nThere is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but healthy living\u00a0will help. In particular,\u00a0you should\u00a0stop smoking,\u00a0if you smoke.\nManaging symptoms at home\nIf you have bronchitis:\n\nget plenty of rest\ndrink lots of fluids \u2013 this helps prevent dehydration and thins the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up\ntreat headaches, fever, and aches and pains with\u00a0paracetamol or\u00a0ibuprofen \u2013 although ibuprofen is not recommended if you have asthma\u00a0\n\nThere is little evidence that cough medicines work \u2013 read\u00a0more about\u00a0treating coughs. The\u00a0Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)\u00a0has recommended that over-the-counter cough medicines should not be given to children under the age of six.\nAs an alternative to an\u00a0over-the-counter\u00a0cough medicine, try making your own mixture of honey and lemon, which can help soothe a\u00a0sore throat and ease your cough.\nStop smoking\nIf you smoke, you should stop immediately. Smoking aggravates\u00a0bronchitis and increases your risk of developing a long-term (chronic) condition.\nStopping smoking while you have bronchitis can also be the perfect opportunity to quit altogether.\nAntibiotics\nAlthough treatment from a GP is rarely necessary, there may be times when you should see one \u2013 read more about\u00a0when to see your GP.\nYour GP will not routinely prescribe\u00a0antibiotics, as bronchitis is nearly always caused by a virus. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, and prescribing them when they are unnecessary can, over time, make bacteria more resistant to antibiotic treatment.\u00a0\nYour GP will only prescribe antibiotics if you have an increased risk of developing complications, such as pneumonia.\u00a0Antibiotics may be recommended for:\n\npremature babies\nelderly people over the age of 80\npeople with a history of heart, lung, kidney or liver disease\npeople with a weakened immune system, which could be the result of an underlying condition or a side effect of a treatment such as steroid medication\npeople with\u00a0cystic fibrosis\n\nIf you are prescribed antibiotics for bronchitis, it is likely to be a five-day course of amoxicillin, oxytetracycline or doxycycline.\nPossible side effects of these medicines include nausea, vomiting and\u00a0diarrhoea, but they are uncommon.\nChronic bronchitis\nChronic bronchitis is treated in the same way as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nFor example:\n\na type of medication called mucolytics can be used to make mucus easier to cough up\nan exercise programme known as pulmonary rehabilitation can help you cope better with your symptoms\n\nStopping smoking is also very important if you have been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis or COPD.\nRead more about the treatment of COPD.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder and mental health condition. People with bulimia are very anxious about their weight and focused on having the \u2018right\u2019 body shape. They also spend a lot of time thinking about food.\nPeople with bulimia overeat in a pattern known as \u2018binge eating\u2019, meaning they eat a lot of food (or what feels to them like a lot of food) in a short space of time. They then try to avoid digesting the food and gaining weight from it by \u2018purging\u2019. There are a number of ways people purge, including making themselves vomit or using laxatives (medication that causes you to poo).\nRead more about bulimia symptoms\nHow common is bulimia?\nIt\u2019s estimated that bulimia affects around 1.5% of women and 0.5% of men across the course of a lifetime. It\u2019s unusual for bulimia symptoms to develop before puberty, and the most common time for the condition to develop is the teenage years.\nTreating bulimia\nBulimia can be treated using a number of different talking therapies, including guided self-help and cognitive behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED).\nIf you have an eating disorder such as bulimia, the first step is to recognise that you have a problem. Then, you need to visit your GP for a medical check-up and advice on how to get treatment.\nIf you think someone you know has bulimia nervosa, talk to them and try to persuade them to see their GP.\nRead more about treating bulimia\n\n\nThe main symptoms of bulimia are:\n\nbingeing \u2013 overeating in a particular pattern\npurging \u2013 trying to reduce the effect of binging by attempting to get calories out of your body\nfocus on food \u2013 thinking about food all the time, even when you don\u2019t want to\nproblems with self-esteem and focus on body image when it comes to food and weight\n\nIn order for an episode of binge eating to be considered a binge, it should have 2 key features. The first is that the amount of food eaten is far more than normal for the situation \u2013 for example, many people eat a lot more on Christmas Day than they would on any other day, but this is normal for the situation, so it wouldn\u2019t qualify as a binge.\nThe second feature is a feeling that the eating is out of control \u2013 feeling as if you can\u2019t stop eating. You might feel disconnected \u2013 as if you\u2019re watching the binge happen from outside your body.\nThere may be times when a person eats a relatively small amount of food, but it still feels like a binge because they feel a loss of control.\nBinge eating is usually a very quick process and you may feel physically uncomfortable afterwards. When binge eating is a symptom of bulimia, it happens regularly, not just once or twice.\nBinge eating episodes are sometimes spontaneous, where you eat anything you can find. They can also be planned, where you make a shopping trip to buy foods specifically to binge on.\nPeople often find eating comforting. Binges can start as a way to cope with difficult emotions, but become increasingly frequent and out of control.\nAfter bingeing, you might feel guilty, anxious, and angry with yourself. You may also feel uncomfortable physically, for example you might feel sick or bloated from the amount you\u2019ve eaten. Purging is a response to these feelings, as well as an attempt to \u2018undo\u2019 any weight gain that could be caused by the binge.\nThere are a number of ways that people try to purge:\n\nmaking yourself vomit\ntaking laxatives (medicine that makes you poo)\ntaking illegal drugs, such as amphetamines, to try to make your body burn energy faster\n\nIn reality, purging has little effect on the calories absorbed from food.\nPeople with bulimia experience \u2018intrusive thoughts\u2019 about food. Intrusive thoughts are unwanted thoughts that come into your mind without you wanting to think about them. Because people with bulimia are concerned about gaining weight and body image, but they also consider food something comforting, these thoughts cause distress.\nPart of the problem for many people with bulimia is that they\u2019ve learned that eating is comforting. When they feel distress, they want to eat in order to feel better.\nPeople with bulimia also often restrict what they eat, which means that they are feeling hungry often, so they think more about food. When someone is very hungry, intrusive thoughts about food are likely.\nAfter a certain period of time where people with bulimia try to avoid eating, in order to avoid gaining weight, they are likely to lose control and binge.\nPeople with bulimia often have problems with their self-esteem in general, and as a result can spend a lot of time thinking about their body shape and eating habits. This can lead to setting strict rules about dieting, eating or exercising, which are very hard to maintain.\nWhen people with bulimia are unable to keep to these strict rules, they tend to binge eat. After feeling guilty about binging, they purge to get rid of the calories.\nThese feelings of guilt then further affect self-esteem, causing what\u2019s often called a \u2018cycle of guilt\u2019.\n\n\nThe exact causes of bulimia are unclear, but most specialists believe it's likely to be the result of a combination of factors.\nMany people who develop bulimia share certain patterns of thinking and behaving that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include:\n\na tendency towards depression and anxiety\nfinding it difficult to handle stress\nfrequently worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future\nperfectionism \u2013 setting strict, demanding goals or standards that are unrealistic for them to maintain\nfinding it hard to express feelings\nexperiencing unwanted thoughts, images or urges that make them feel they have to behave in certain ways\n\nEnvironmental factors are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.\nPuberty can be an important factor contributing to bulimia. This is likely due to the combination of hormonal changes and feelings of stress, anxiety and low self-esteem during puberty.\nStressful life changes \u2013 for example, moving house, the breakdown of a relationship, going to college or university, or a bereavement \u2013 can also have an impact. When these changes happen during puberty, the effect can be even greater.\nWestern culture and society may also play a part. People of all ages are exposed to a wide range of media messages promoting the idea that only certain body shapes are desirable, and that not having the \u2018ideal\u2019 body is something to be ashamed of. Even health advice that\u2019s intended to be helpful can have a focus on the risks of being overweight, which can add to feelings of pressure and low self-esteem.\nThe media also places significant focus on celebrities\u2019 bodies, pointing out things like cellulite or slight weight gain. This can make people feel insecure about these parts of their own bodies.\nOther environmental factors that can contribute towards bulimia include:\n\npressure and stress at school, such as exams or bullying \u2013 particularly if someone is bullied about body weight or shape\noccupations or hobbies where being thin is seen as the ideal, such as dancing or athletics\nhaving a family that places high value on being thin and physically active, and praises or rewards weight loss\ndifficult family relationships\nphysical or sexual abuse\n\nThe risk of developing bulimia is thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders. This suggests that genetics could contribute to developing bulimia.\nAs with other mental health conditions, like depression, people with bulimia might have some differences in the way their brains work compared to people who don\u2019t have the condition. These differences may affect the part of the brain that\u2019s linked to appetite and body image.\n\n\nWhen making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your eating habits. For example, they could ask:\n\nhow you feel about your weight, and if you\u2019re concerned about it\nif you make yourself vomit regularly\nif you binge-eat\n\nIt\u2019s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn\u2019t trying to judge you or \u2018catch you out\u2019. They just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are.\nYour GP may check your weight and calculate your body mass index (BMI). A healthy BMI for adults in Scotland is 20-25.\nFind out how to calculate your BMI\nYour GP may not need to carry out any tests to diagnose bulimia, but they\u2019ll probably check your pulse and blood pressure.\nSometimes an ECG (electrocardiogram) may be needed to check how well your heart is working.\nYour GP may do blood tests to check the level of:\n\nfluids in your body\nchemicals or minerals, such as potassium in your blood\n\nBlood tests look for the complications of bulimia, so even if they come back as \u2018normal\u2019, you may still benefit from a referral to a specialist if you\u2019re experiencing bulimia symptoms.\nIf your GP thinks you may have bulimia, they\u2019ll refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment \u2013 see\u00a0Treating bulimia for more information.\n\n\nBefore your treatment begins, you will probably have an overall assessment of your health. This may be done by your GP or another healthcare professional, such as one that specialises in eating disorders.\nThe assessment will help your healthcare professional draw up a plan for your treatment and care. For example, they may assess:\n\nyour overall health and any medical needs\nyour social situation, such as how much support you have from family and friends\nyour mood and any risks that affect you, such as whether you are at risk of harming yourself\nwhether there are any physical risks as a result of bulimia that mean urgent treatment is needed\n\nFor many people, guided self-help can be an effective treatment for bulimia. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own, and have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist). These activities can include filling out worksheets, keeping a food diary and meal plan, and writing about difficult thoughts and feelings.\nIf this is unsuccessful, your GP can refer you for treatment to an eating disorder service, where you may be offered a structured programme of psychological treatment.\nSome people may also benefit from antidepressant medication (fluoxetine), as this can reduce the urges to binge and vomit.\nThe main type of psychological treatment for bulimia is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. If bulimia is causing someone to behave in an unhealthy way, CBT helps them to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how they think about food, eating, and weight.\nOne alternative to CBT is interpersonal therapy (IPT). IPT is based on the idea that relationships with other people and the outside world in general have a range of effects on your mental health, both positive and negative. IPT explores the way you interact with other people and the relationships you have, with the goal of improving them.\nLearn more about talking therapies\nThe types of therapy available can vary depending on where you live. Although different types of therapy take different approaches, the most important part of any talking therapy is the relationship you build with your therapist.\nAntidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used to treat bulimia. The SSRI usually recommended to treat bulimia is called fluoxetine (brand name Prozac).\nAs with any antidepressant, an SSRI will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You\u2019ll usually be started on a low dose, which is then gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.\nWhen you start taking an SSRI, see your GP after 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks to check your progress and to see if you\u2019re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it's important your progress is carefully monitored.\nVery few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It\u2019s also best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease.\nRecovery from bulimia can take a long time, and it\u2019s quite common for bulimia symptoms to return after treatment \u2013 this is often referred to as relapse, and is more likely during times of stress. If relapse happens, the approach to getting treatment is the same \u2013 the first step is going to your GP.\n\n\nThere are a number of physical complications associated with bulimia.\nThese can include:\n\ndental problems \u2013 regular vomiting can cause your stomach acid to damage the enamel on your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay\nrepeated vomiting can cause bad breath and a sore throat\ndue to a lack of nutrients, your skin and hair can become dry and your fingernails can become brittle\nyour saliva glands can become swollen from frequent vomiting, which makes your face appear rounder\nfrequent vomiting or laxative use can cause chemical imbalances in your body \u2013 this can cause tiredness, weakness, abnormal heart rhythms, kidney damage, convulsions (fits), and muscle spasms\nfrequent use of laxatives can damage your bowel muscles, resulting in permanent constipation (finding it difficult to poo)\nlong-term complications of bulimia can include an increased risk of heart problems\n\nIf you have periods, bulimia can cause them to become unpredictable, or even stop altogether. This does not mean bulimia makes you infertile \u2013 while it may be harder to get pregnant, you should continue to use birth control if you aren\u2019t planning a pregnancy.\nIf you have diabetes, you\u2019ll need regular health checks to help avoid problems with your eyes or other serious complications. This is particularly important if you have type 1 diabetes.\nBulimia isn\u2019t usually treated in hospital. However, if you have serious health complications and your life is at risk, you may be admitted to hospital.\n\n\nIf someone has bulimia, the most important steps towards diagnosis and treatment\u00a0are for them to:\n\nrecognise they need help\nwant to get better\n\nHowever, to take this first step they may need lots of support and encouragement. It\u2019s understandable that people who have bulimia can be anxious about seeking treatment that might mean making changes to their eating habits.\nIf you have eating problems or think you may have bulimia, it\u2019s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:\n\ntalking to someone you trust, such as a friend or member of your family\ngoing to see your GP \u2013 you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support\n\nIf someone close to you is showing signs of bulimia, you can offer help and support.\nYou could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.\nIf you\u2019d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own GP, can provide information on:\n\nhow to help the person recognise that they have a problem\nthe treatments available\nhow you can support them during their treatment\n\nYou could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders. Your own GP or Scotland\u2019s Service Directory can help you find services near you.\nA leading charity for people with eating disorders is Beat, which has a range of information on the help and support available for people with eating disorders, and their friends and families.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and the underlying tissue.

It affects the skin and can also cause additional symptoms.\nSkin symptoms\nCellulitis causes the affected skin to become:\n\nred\nhot\nswollen\npainful\ntender\n\nThere may also be a break in the skin, although this isn't always obvious, and pus or blood-filled blisters.\nAny part of the body can be affected.\nCommonly affected areas include the lower legs, feet, arms or hands, and sometimes the face, particularly around the eyes.\nSee your GP or visit your nearest minor injuries unit as soon as possible if an area of your skin suddenly turns red, painful and hot.\nAdditional symptoms\nCellulitis can also cause additional symptoms that may develop before or alongside the changes to your\u00a0skin.\nThese can include:\n\nfeeling generally unwell\nfeeling sick\nshivering\nchills\n\nOccasionally the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the deeper layers of tissue, blood, muscle and bone. This can\u00a0be very serious and potentially life threatening.\nSigns the infection has spread include:\n\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\na fast\u00a0heartbeat\u00a0or\u00a0fast breathing\nbeing sick\ndiarrhoea\nfeeling\u00a0dizzy or faint\nconfusion\u00a0or disorientation\ncold, clammy,\u00a0pale\u00a0skin\nunresponsiveness or loss of consciousness\n\nCall 999 or\u00a0go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you have other symptoms in addition to changes to your skin.\n\n\nCellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection. It occurs when bacteria get into the tissues beneath the skin.\nHow\u00a0the infection\u00a0occurs\nThe bacteria that cause cellulitis often live harmlessly on the skin. But if the surface of your skin is damaged, they can get into the layers underneath and cause an infection.\nThe break in the skin may be so small it's not noticeable.\nIt\u00a0may be caused by:\n\na cut or graze\u00a0\na burn\nan animal or human bite\nan insect bite\na puncture wound\na leg\u00a0ulcer\u00a0\nthe skin becoming dry and cracked\u00a0\u2013 for example, because of eczema or athlete's foot\n\nCellulitis isn't normally spread from person to person as the infection occurs deep within the skin and is often caused by bacteria that live on the skin's surface without causing problems.\nIncreased risk\nAnyone can get cellulitis, but you're at an increased risk if:\n\nyou're\u00a0obese\u00a0\nyou have poor circulation in your arms, legs, hands or feet\nyou have a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 for example, because of HIV\u00a0or chemotherapy treatment\nyou have\u00a0lymphoedema\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes fluid to build up under your skin\nyou have poorly\u00a0controlled\u00a0diabetes\nyou've had cellulitis before\nyou use injected drugs\n\nEnsuring\u00a0the underlying health conditions\u00a0mentioned above are well controlled may help reduce your risk of getting cellulitis.\u00a0\n\n\nCellulitis can often be treated at home with a course of antibiotics, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital.\nTreatment at home\nIf you're treated at home, you'll usually be prescribed\u00a0antibiotic tablets to take two to four times a day for a week.\nA longer course may be needed if your symptoms don't improve after a week or you\u00a0have an underlying condition that makes cellulitis more difficult to treat,\u00a0such as\u00a0lymphoedema.\nCommonly prescribed antibiotics include flucloxacillin and clarithromycin. Possible side effects can include\u00a0an upset stomach or diarrhoea.\nYour symptoms may get worse in the first 48 hours after treatment starts, but should start to improve soon afterwards.\nMake sure you complete the whole course of medicine you're given, even if you're feeling better.\nWhile you're recovering at home, the following\u00a0steps\u00a0can help ease your symptoms and aid your recovery:\n\ntake\u00a0paracetamol or ibuprofen\u00a0for the pain\nraise the affected body part to reduce swelling\u00a0\u2013 for example, if your leg is affected, rest it on pillows or a chair when you're sitting or lying down\ntry to regularly move the joint near the affected body part, such as your wrist or ankle, to stop\u00a0it getting stiff\ndrink plenty of fluids to avoid\u00a0dehydration\nif you usually wear compression stockings\u00a0\u2013 for example, for lymphoedema\u00a0\u2013 avoid these until you've recovered\n\nContact your GP as soon as possible if:\n\nyour symptoms get worse after 48 hours\nyour symptoms haven't improved after a week\nyou develop additional symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) or vomiting\n\nTreatment in hospital\nIf you need to be admitted to hospital for treatment, you'll be given antibiotics directly into a vein through an injection or a drip (intravenous antibiotics).\nOnce you've recovered from the initial symptoms, you can usually be treated with antibiotic injections or tablets at home or as an outpatient, rather than staying in hospital.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in a woman's cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina).\nCancer of the cervix often has no symptoms in its early stages. If you do have symptoms,\u00a0the most common is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in between\u00a0periods or after the menopause.\nAbnormal bleeding doesn't mean that you definitely have cervical cancer, but it should be investigated by your GP as soon as possible. If your GP thinks you might have cervical cancer, you should be referred to see a specialist within 2 weeks.\nRead more about the symptoms of cervical cancer\u00a0and diagnosing cervical cancer\nScreening for cervical cancer\nCervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland, between the ages of 25 and 64, every 5 years.\u00a0You may be recalled more often depending on your test results.\nThose on non-routine screening (where screening results have shown changes that need further investigation or follow up) will be invited up to 70 years of age.\u00a0\nIf you have unusual discharge, or bleeding after sex, between periods or after the menopause, contact your GP practice. These symptoms are not usually caused my cancer but it's important to have them checked.\u00a0\nYou\u00a0will be sent a letter confirming when your screening appointment is due. Contact your GP if you think you may be overdue for a screening appointment.\nRead more about cervical screening\nWhat causes cervical cancer?\nAlmost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is a very common virus that can be passed on through any type of sexual contact with a man or a woman.\nThere are more than 100 different types of HPV, many of which are harmless. However, some types of HPV can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix, which can eventually lead to cervical cancer.\nTwo strains of the HPV virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18)\u00a0are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer.\u00a0These types of HPV infection don't have any symptoms, so many women won't realise they have the infection.\nHowever, it's important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who\u00a0have\u00a0them don't develop cervical cancer.\nUsing condoms during sex offers some protection against HPV, but it can't always prevent infection, because the virus is also spread through skin-to-skin contact of the wider genital area.\nSince 2008, a\u00a0HPV vaccine\u00a0has been routinely offered to girls aged 12 and 13.\nRead more about the causes of cervical cancer\u00a0and preventing cervical cancer\nTreating cervical cancer\nIf cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it's usually possible to treat it using surgery. In some cases, it's possible to leave the womb in place, but it\u00a0may need to be removed. The surgical procedure used to remove the womb is\u00a0called a hysterectomy.\nRadiotherapy is an alternative to surgery for some women with early-stage cervical cancer. In some cases, it's used alongside surgery.\nMore advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nSome of the treatments used can have significant and long-lasting side effects, including early menopause\u00a0and infertility.\nRead more about treating cervical cancer\nComplications\nMany women with cervical cancer will have complications. These can arise as a direct result of the cancer or as a side effect of treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and\u00a0surgery.\nComplications associated with cervical cancer can range from the relatively minor, such as minor bleeding from the vagina or\u00a0having to urinate frequently, to life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or kidney failure.\nRead more about the complications of cervical cancer\nOutlook\nThe stage at which cervical cancer is diagnosed is an important factor in determining outlook. The staging, given as a number from 1 to 4, indicates how far the cancer has spread.\nThe chances of living for at least 5 years after being diagnosed with cervical cancer are:\n\nstage 1 \u2013 80-99%\nstage 2 \u2013 60-90%\nstage 3 \u2013 30-50%\nstage 4 \u2013 20%\n\nRead more about the staging of cervical cancer\nWho's affected by cervical cancer?\nFollowing the success of the NHS Cervical Screening Programme and the early detection of cell changes, the number of cervical cancer cases in the UK has reduced. Around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year.\nIt's possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, but the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. Cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25.\n\n\nThe symptoms of cervical cancer aren't always obvious, and it may not cause any symptoms at all until it's reached an advanced stage.\nThis is why it's very important that you attend all of your cervical screening appointments.\nUnusual bleeding\nIn most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex.\nBleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly period is also considered unusual. This includes bleeding after the\u00a0menopause (when a woman's monthly periods stop).\nVisit your GP for advice if you experience any type of unusual vaginal bleeding.\nOther symptoms\nOther symptoms of cervical cancer may include pain and discomfort during sex and an unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge.\nAdvanced cervical cancer\nIf the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including:\n\nconstipation \nblood in your urine (haematuria)\nloss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)\nbone pain\nswelling of one of your legs\nsevere pain in your side or back caused by swelling in your kidneys, related to a\u00a0condition called hydronephrosis\nchanges to your bladder and bowel habits\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\ntiredness and a lack of energy\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should contact your GP if you experience:\n\nbleeding after sex (postcoital bleeding)\nbleeding outside of your normal periods\nnew bleeding after the menopause\n\nVaginal bleeding is very common and can have a wide range of causes, so it doesn't necessarily mean you have cervical cancer. However, unusual vaginal bleeding is a symptom that needs to be investigated by your GP.\n\n\nIn almost all cases, cervical cancer is the result of a change in cell DNA caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV).\nCancer begins with a change in the structure of the DNA that's present in all human cells. DNA provides the cells with a basic set of instructions, including when to grow and reproduce.\nA change in the DNA's structure is known as a mutation. It can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means the cells continue growing instead of stopping when they should. If the cells reproduce uncontrollably, they produce a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV)\nMore than\u00a099% of cervical cancer\u00a0cases occur in women who have been previously infected with HPV. HPV is a group of viruses, rather than a single virus. There are more than 100 different types.\nHPV is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity (such as skin-to-skin contact of the genital areas, or using sex toys) and is thought to be very common.\u00a0It's estimated that 1 in 3 women will develop an HPV infection within 2 years of starting to have regular sex, and about 4 in 5\u00a0women will develop the infection at some point in their lives.\nSome types of HPV don't cause any noticeable symptoms and the infection will pass without treatment. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts, although these types aren't linked to an increased risk of causing cervical cancer.\nAbout 15 types of HPV are considered high-risk for cervical cancer. The 2 types known to have the highest risk are HPV 16 and HPV 18, which\u00a0cause about 7 out of every 10 cervical cancers.\nHigh-risk types of HPV are thought to contain genetic material that can be passed into the cells of the cervix. This material begins to disrupt the normal workings of the cells, which can eventually cause them to reproduce uncontrollably, leading to the growth of a cancerous tumour.\nAs most types of HPV don't cause any symptoms, you or your partner could have the virus for months or years without knowing it.\nSee\u00a0preventing cervical cancer for more information about reducing your chances of developing an HPV infection.\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)\nCancer of the cervix usually takes many years to develop. Before it does, the cells in the cervix often show changes known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or, less commonly, cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN).\nCIN and CGIN are pre-cancerous conditions. Pre-cancerous conditions don't pose an immediate threat to a person's health, but they can potentially develop into cancer in the future.\nHowever, even if you develop CIN or CGIN, the chances of it developing into cervical cancer are very small, and if the changes are discovered during cervical screening, treatment is\u00a0highly successful.\nThe progression from becoming infected with HPV to developing CIN or CGIN\u00a0and then developing cervical cancer is very slow, often\u00a0taking 10 to 20 years.\nRead more about cervical screening results\nIncreased risk\nThe fact that HPV infection is very common but cervical cancer is relatively uncommon\u00a0suggests that only a very small proportion of women are vulnerable to the effects of an HPV infection. There appear to be additional\u00a0risk factors that affect\u00a0a woman's chance of developing cervical cancer. These include:\n\nsmoking \u2013 women who smoke are twice as likely to\u00a0develop cervical cancer than women who don't; this may be caused by the harmful effects of chemicals found in tobacco on the cells of the cervix\nhaving a weakened immune system \u2013\u00a0this can occur as a result of taking certain medications, such as immunosuppressants, which are used to stop the body rejecting donated organs, or as a result of a condition such as HIV or AIDS\ntaking the\u00a0oral contraceptive pill for more than 5 years \u2013 women who take the pill are thought to have twice the risk of developing cervical cancer than those who don't, although it's not clear why\nhaving children (the more children you have, the greater your risk) \u2013 women who have 2 children have twice the risk of getting cervical cancer compared\u00a0with women who don't have any children\n\nThe reason for the link between cervical cancer and childbirth is unclear. One theory is that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may make the cervix more vulnerable to the effects of HPV.\nThe spread of cervical cancer\nIf cervical cancer is undiagnosed and untreated, it will slowly spread out of the cervix\u00a0and into the surrounding tissue and organs. The cancer can spread down to the vagina and the surrounding muscles that support the bones of the pelvis. Alternatively, it can spread upwards, blocking the tube that runs from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters).\nThe cancer\u00a0can then spread into your bladder, rectum (back passage) and eventually into your liver, bones and lungs. Cancerous cells can also spread through your lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of nodes (glands) and channels spread throughout your body in a similar way to the blood circulation system.\nThe lymph nodes produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). If you have an infection, the nodes in your neck or under your armpits can become swollen.\nIn some cases of early cervical cancer, the lymph nodes close to the cervix contain cancerous cells. In some cases of advanced cervical cancer, lymph nodes in the chest and abdomen can be affected.\n\n\nIf cervical cancer is suspected, you'll be referred to a gynaecologist (a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system).\nReferral will be recommended if the results of your cervical screening test suggest that there are abnormalities in the cells of your cervix. However, in most cases, the abnormalities don't mean you have cervical cancer.\nYou may also be referred to a gynaecologist if you have abnormal vaginal\u00a0bleeding, or if your GP has noticed a growth inside your cervix during an examination.\nThe sexually transmitted infection (STI) chlamydia is one of the most common reasons why women experience unusual vaginal bleeding. Your GP may recommend that you're tested for it first before being referred. Testing for chlamydia involves taking a small tissue sample from your cervix, or carrying out a urine test.\nColposcopy\nIf you've had an abnormal cervical screening test result, or your symptoms suggest that you may have cervical cancer, your gynaecologist will usually carry out a colposcopy. This is an examination to look for abnormalities in your cervix.\nDuring a colposcopy, a small microscope with a light source at the end (colposcope) is used. As well as examining your cervix, your gynaecologist may remove a small tissue sample (biopsy) so that it can be checked under a microscope for cancerous cells.\nCone biopsy\nIn some cases, a minor operation called a cone biopsy may also be carried out. The operation is carried out in hospital, usually under a local anaesthetic.\nDuring a cone biopsy, a small, cone-shaped section of your cervix will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells. You may experience vaginal bleeding for up to four weeks after the procedure. You may also have period-like pains.\nFurther testing\nIf the results of the biopsy suggest you have cervical cancer and there's a risk that the cancer may have spread, you'll probably need to have some further tests to assess how widespread the cancer is. These tests may include:\n\na pelvic examination carried out under general anaesthetic \u2013 your womb, vagina, rectum and bladder will be checked for cancer\nblood tests\u00a0\u2013\u00a0these can be used to help assess the state of your liver, kidneys and bone marrow\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 scans are taken of the inside of your body and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed three-dimensional image; the CT scan can help to identify cancerous tumours and show whether cancerous cells have spread\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0\u2013 this type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the inside of your body; it can also be used to check whether cancer has spread\nchest X-ray\u00a0\u2013 this will indicate whether cancer has spread to your lungs\npositive emission tomography (PET) scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a specialised scan, where a mildly radioactive substance is injected into your veins so the cancerous tissue shows up more clearly; it's often combined with a CT scan\u00a0and is used to see if the cancer has spread, or to check how well a person is responding to treatment\n\nStaging\nAfter all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell you what stage cancer you have. Staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. The higher the stage, the further the cancer has spread. The staging for cervical cancer is as follows:\n\nstage 0 (pre-cancer) \u2013 there are no cancerous cells in the cervix, but there are biological changes that could trigger cancer in the future; this is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ (CIS)\nstage 1 \u2013 the cancer is still contained inside the cervix\nstage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread outside of the cervix into the surrounding tissue, but hasn't reached the tissues lining the pelvis (pelvic wall) or the lower part of the vagina\nstage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread into the lower section of the vagina and/or into the pelvic wall\nstage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread into the bowel, bladder or other organs, such as\u00a0the lungs\n\n\n\nTreatment for cervical cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread.\nAs cancer treatments are often complex, hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat cervical cancer and tailor the treatment programme to the individual.\nMDTs are made up of a number of different specialists who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nYour cancer team will recommend what they think\u00a0the best treatment options are, but the final decision will be yours. In most cases, the recommendations will be:\n\nearly cervical cancer \u2013 surgery to remove some or all of the womb,\u00a0radiotherapy,\u00a0or a combination\nadvanced cervical cancer \u2013 radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, although\u00a0surgery is also sometimes used\n\nThe prospect of a complete cure is good for cervical cancer diagnosed at an early stage, although the chances of a complete cure decrease the further the cancer has spread.\nIn cases where cervical cancer isn't curable, it's often possible to slow its progression, prolong lifespan and relieve any associated symptoms, such as pain and vaginal bleeding. This is known as\u00a0palliative care.\nRemoving abnormal cells\nIf your screening results show that you don't have cervical cancer, but there are biological changes that could turn cancerous in the future, a number of treatment options are available. These include:\n\nlarge loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) \u2013 the abnormal cells are cut away using a fine wire and an electrical current\ncone biopsy \u2013 the area of abnormal tissue is removed during surgery\nlaser therapy \u2013 a laser is used to burn away the abnormal cells\n\nRead more about treating abnormal cells in the cervix\nSurgery\nThere are 3 main types of surgery for cervical cancer. They are:\n\nradical trachelectomy \u2013 the cervix, surrounding tissue and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the womb is left in place\nhysterectomy \u2013 the cervix and womb are removed; depending on the stage of the cancer, it may also be necessary to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes\npelvic exenteration \u2013 a major operation in which the cervix, vagina, womb, bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectum are removed\n\nA radical trachelectomy is usually only suitable if cervical cancer is diagnosed at a\u00a0very early stage. It's usually offered to women who want to preserve their child-bearing potential.\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions (cuts)\u00a0in your abdomen. Specially designed instruments will be passed through the incisions and used to remove your cervix and the upper section of your vagina. Lymph nodes from your pelvis may also be removed. Your womb will then be reattached to the lower section of your vagina.\nCompared\u00a0with a hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration,\u00a0the advantage of this type of surgery\u00a0is that your womb remains intact, which means that you may\u00a0still be able to have children. However, it's important to be aware that the surgeons carrying out this operation can't guarantee you'll still be able to have children.\nIf you do have children after the operation, your child would have to be delivered by\u00a0caesarean section. It's also usually recommended that you wait 6 to 12 months after having surgery before trying for a baby, so that your womb and vagina have time to heal.\nRadical trachelectomy is a highly skilled procedure. It's only available at a number of specialist centres in the UK, so it may not be available in your area and you may have to travel to another city to be treated.\nA\u00a0hysterectomy is usually recommended for early cervical cancer. This may be followed by a course of radiotherapy to help prevent the cancer coming back.\nThere are 2 types of hysterectomies used to treat cervical cancer:\n\nsimple hysterectomy \u2013 where the cervix and womb are removed and, in some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed; this is only appropriate for very early stage cervical cancers\nradical hysterectomy \u2013 where the cervix, womb, surrounding tissue and lymph nodes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are all removed; this is the preferred option in advanced stage 1 and some early stage 2 cervical cancers\n\nShort-term complications of a hysterectomy include infection, bleeding, blood clots and accidental injury to your ureter, bladder\u00a0or rectum.\nThe risk of long-term complications is\u00a0small, but they can be troublesome. They include:\n\nthe risk that your vagina can\u00a0become shortened and drier, which can make sex painful\nurinary incontinence\nswelling of your arms and legs, caused by a build-up of fluid (lymphoedema)\nyour bowel becomes obstructed\u00a0because of\u00a0a build-up of scar tissue\u00a0\u2013 this may require further surgery to correct\n\nAs your womb is removed during a hysterectomy, you'll no longer be able to have children.\nIf your ovaries are removed, it will also trigger the menopause\u00a0if you haven't already experienced it. See complications of cervical cancer for more information about the menopause.\nA pelvic exenteration is a major operation that's usually only recommended when cervical cancer returns after what was thought to be a previously successful course of treatment. It's offered if the cancer returns to the pelvis, but hasn't spread beyond this area.\nA pelvic exenteration involves two phases of treatment:\n\nthe cancer is removed, plus your bladder, rectum, vagina and the lower section of your bowel\n2 holes called stomas are created in your abdomen\u00a0\u2013 the holes are used to pass urine and faeces out of your body into collection pouches called colostomy bags\n\nFollowing a pelvic exenteration, your vagina can be reconstructed using skin and tissue taken from other parts of your body. This means you'll be able to have sex after the procedure, although it may be several months until you feel well enough to do so.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0may be\u00a0used on its own or combined with surgery\u00a0for early-stage\u00a0cervical cancer. It may be combined with chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer, where it can be used to control bleeding and pain.\nThere are 2 ways that radiotherapy can be delivered. These are:\n\nexternally \u2013 a machine beams high-energy waves into your pelvis to destroy cancerous cells\ninternally \u2013 a radioactive implant is placed inside your vagina and cervix\n\nIn most cases, a combination of internal and external radiotherapy will be used. A course of radiotherapy usually lasts for around 5 to 8 weeks.\nAs well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can sometimes also harm healthy tissue.\u00a0This means it can cause significant side effects many months, and even years, after treatment.\nHowever,\u00a0the benefits of radiotherapy often tend to outweigh the risks. For some people, radiotherapy offers the only hope of getting rid of the cancer.\nSide effects of radiotherapy\u00a0are common and can include:\n\ndiarrhoea\npain when urinating\nbleeding from your vagina or rectum\nfeeling very tired (fatigue)\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nsore skin in your pelvis region\u00a0similar to sunburn\nnarrowing of your vagina, which can make having sex painful\ninfertility\ndamage to the ovaries, which will usually trigger an early menopause (if you haven't already experienced it)\nbladder and bowel damage, which could lead to incontinence\n\nMost of these side effects will resolve within about eight weeks of finishing treatment, although in some cases they can be permanent. It's also possible to develop side effects several months, or even years after treatment has finished.\nIf infertility is a concern for you, it may be possible to surgically remove eggs from your ovaries before you have radiotherapy, so that they can be implanted in your womb at a later date. However, you may have to pay for this.\nIt may also be possible to prevent early menopause by surgically removing your ovaries and replanting them outside\u00a0the area of your pelvis that will be affected by radiation. This is known as an ovarian transposition.\nYour MDT can provide more information about the possible options for treating infertility and whether you're suitable for an ovarian transposition.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy can be combined with radiotherapy to try\u00a0to cure cervical cancer, or it can be used as a sole treatment for advanced cancer to slow\u00a0its progression and relieve symptoms (palliative chemotherapy).\nChemotherapy involves using either a single chemotherapy medication called cisplatin or a combination of different chemotherapy medications to kill the\u00a0cancerous cells.\u00a0\nChemotherapy is usually given using an intravenous drip on an outpatient basis, so you'll be able to go home once you've received your dose.\nAs with radiotherapy, these medications can also damage healthy tissue. Side effects are therefore\u00a0common and can\u00a0include:\n\nnausea and vomiting\ndiarrhoea\nfeeling tired all the time\nreduced production of blood cells, which can make you feel tired and breathless (anaemia) and vulnerable to infection because of a lack of white blood cells\nmouth ulcers\u00a0\nloss of appetite\nhair loss\u00a0\u2013 your hair should grow back within three to six months of your course of chemotherapy being completed, although not all chemotherapy medications cause hair loss\n\nSome types of chemotherapy medication can damage your kidneys, so you may need to have regular\u00a0blood tests to assess the health of your kidneys.\nFollow-up\nAfter your treatment has been completed and the cancer has been removed, you'll need to attend regular appointments for testing. This will usually involve a physical examination of your vagina and cervix (if it hasn't been removed).\nAs there's a risk of cervical cancer returning, these examinations will be used to look for signs of this. If anything suspicious is found,\u00a0a further biopsy can be carried out.\nIf cervical cancer does return, it usually returns around 18 months after a course of treatment has been completed.\nFollow-up appointments are usually recommended every four months after treatment has been completed for the first 2 years, and then every 6 to 12 months for a further 3 years.\n\n\nComplications of cervical cancer can occur as a side effect of treatment or as the result of advanced cervical cancer.\nSide effects\nIf your ovaries are surgically removed or they're damaged during treatment with radiotherapy, it will trigger an\u00a0early menopause (if you haven't already had it). Most women experience the menopause in their early fifties.\nThe menopause is caused when your ovaries stop producing the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. This leads to the following symptoms:\n\nyou no longer have monthly periods\u00a0or your periods become much more irregular\nhot flushes\nvaginal dryness\nloss of sex drive\nmood changes\nstress incontinence\u00a0(leaking urine when you cough or sneeze)\nnight sweats\nthinning of the bones, which can lead to brittle bones (osteoporosis)\n\nThese symptoms can be relieved by taking a number of medications that stimulate the production of oestrogen and progesterone. This treatment is known as\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\nRadiotherapy to treat cervical cancer can often cause your vagina to become narrower, which can make having sex painful or difficult.\nThere are 2 main treatment options if you have a narrowed vagina. The first is to apply hormonal cream to your vagina. This should increase moisture within your vagina and make having sex easier.\nThe second is to use a vaginal dilator, which is a tampon-shaped device made of plastic. You insert it into your vagina and is designed to help make it more supple. It's usually recommended that you insert the dilator for 5 to 10 minutes at a time on a regular basis during the day over the course of 6 to 12 months.\nMany women find discussing the use of a vaginal dilator embarrassing, but it's a standard and well-recognised treatment for narrowing of the vagina. Your specialist cancer nurse or radiographers in the radiotherapy department should be able to give you more information and advice.\nYou may find that the more times you have sex, the less painful it becomes. However, it may be several months before you feel emotionally ready to be intimate with a sexual partner.\nThe\u00a0Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about sexuality and cancer\nIf the lymph nodes in your pelvis are\u00a0removed, it can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of your lymphatic system.\nOne of the functions of the lymphatic system is to drain away excess fluid from the body's tissue. A disruption to this process can lead to a build-up of fluid in the tissue known as lymphoedema. This can cause certain body parts to become swollen \u2013 usually the legs, in cases of cervical cancer.\nThere are exercises and massage techniques that can reduce the swelling. Wearing specially designed bandages and compression garments can also help.\nRead more about treating lymphoedema\nThe emotional impact of living with cervical cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a 'rollercoaster' effect.\nFor example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel better when removal of the cancer has been confirmed. You may then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of your treatment.\nThis type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression. Typical signs of depression include feeling sad, hopeless and losing interest in things you used to enjoy.\nContact your GP if you think you may be depressed. There is a range of effective treatments available, including antidepressant medication and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nYou may also find\u00a0Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust\u00a0a useful resource. It's the UK's only charity dedicated to women affected by cervical cancer.\nLocal cancer support groups may also be available\u00a0in your area for women affected by cancer. Your specialist cancer nurse should be able to provide contact details.\nRead more about\u00a0feelings and\u00a0cancer\nAdvanced cervical cancer\nSome of the complications that can occur in advanced cervical cancer are discussed below.\nIf the cancer spreads into your nerve endings, bones or muscles, it can often cause severe pain.\nA number of effective painkilling medications can usually be used to control the pain. Depending on the levels of pain, they can range from paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, to more powerful opiate-based painkillers, such as codeine and morphine.\nTell your care team if the painkillers you're prescribed aren't effective in reducing your pain. You may need to be prescribed a stronger medication. A short course of radiotherapy may also be effective in controlling the pain.\nMacmillan nurses, who work both in hospitals and in the community, can also provide expert advice about pain relief.\nYour kidneys remove waste material from your blood. The waste is passed out of your body in urine\u00a0through tubes called the ureters. Kidney function can be monitored by a simple blood test called serum creatinine level.\nIn some cases of advanced cervical cancer, the cancerous tumour can press against the ureters, blocking the flow of urine out of the kidneys. The build-up of urine inside the kidneys is known as\u00a0hydronephrosis and can cause the kidneys to become swollen and stretched.\nSevere cases of hydronephrosis can cause the kidneys to become scarred, which can lead to the loss of most or all of the kidneys' functions. This is known as kidney failure.\nKidney failure can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:\n\ntiredness\nswollen ankles, feet or hands, caused by\u00a0water retention\nshortness of breath\nfeeling sick\nblood in your urine (haematuria)\n\nTreatment options for kidney failure associated with cervical cancer include draining urine out of the kidneys using a tube inserted through the skin and into each kidney (percutaneous nephrostomy). Another option is to widen the ureters by placing a small metal tube called a stent inside them.\nAs with other types of cancer, cervical cancer can make the blood 'stickier' and\u00a0more prone to forming clots. Bed rest after surgery and\u00a0chemotherapy can also increase the risk of developing a clot.\nLarge tumours can press on the veins in the pelvis, which slows the flow of blood and can lead to a blood clot developing in the legs.\nSymptoms of a blood clot in your legs include:\n\npain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf)\na heavy ache in the affected area\nwarm skin in the area of the clot\nredness of\u00a0the skin, particularly at the back of your leg, below the knee\n\nA major concern in these cases is that the blood clot from the leg vein will travel up to the lungs and block the supply of blood. This is known as a\u00a0pulmonary embolism and\u00a0can be fatal.\nBlood clots in the legs are usually treated using a combination of blood-thinning medication, such as heparin or warfarin, and compression garments\u00a0designed to help encourage the flow of blood through the limbs.\nRead more about treating deep vein thrombosis\nIf the cancer spreads into your vagina, bowel or bladder, it can cause significant damage, resulting in bleeding. Bleeding can occur in your vagina or rectum (back passage), or you may pass blood when you urinate.\nMinor bleeding can often be treated using a medication called tranexamic acid, which encourages the blood to clot and stop the bleeding. Radiotherapy can also be highly effective in controlling bleeding caused by cancer.\nMajor bleeding may be treated temporarily by vaginal packing (using gauze to stem the bleeding)\u00a0and later by surgery, radiotherapy or by cutting off blood supply to the cervix.\nA fistula is an uncommon but distressing complication that occurs in around 1 in 50 cases of advanced cervical cancer.\nA fistula is an abnormal channel that develops between 2 sections of the body. In most cases involving cervical cancer, the fistula develops between the bladder and the vagina. This can lead to a persistent discharge of fluid from the vagina. A fistula can sometimes develop between the vagina and rectum.\nSurgery is usually required to repair a fistula, although it's often not possible in\u00a0women with advanced cervical cancer, because they're usually too frail to withstand the effects of surgery.\nIn such cases, treatment often involves using medication, creams and lotions to reduce the amount of discharge and protect the vagina and surrounding tissue from damage and irritation.\nAnother uncommon, but distressing, complication of advanced cervical cancer is an unpleasant-smelling discharge from your vagina.\nThe discharge can occur for a number of reasons, such as the breakdown of tissue, the leakage of bladder or bowel contents out of the vagina, or a bacterial infection of the vagina.\nTreatment options for vaginal discharge include an antibacterial gel called metronidazole and wearing clothing that contains charcoal. Charcoal is a chemical compound that's very effective in absorbing unpleasant smells.\nPalliative care\nIf your doctors can't do any more to treat your cancer, your care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you to be as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care.\nPalliative care also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers.\nThere are different options for terminal care in the late stages of cancer. You may want to think about whether you'd like to be cared for in hospital, in a hospice or at home, and\u00a0discuss these issues with your doctor. Some organisations who provide care for people with cancer include:\n\nMacmillan Cancer Support \u2013 which\u00a0has specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. To be referred to a Macmillan nurse, ask your hospital doctor or GP, or call 0808 808 00 00.\nMarie Curie Cancer Care \u2013 have specially trained nurses who help to look after people with cancer at home. They also run hospices for people with cancer.\nHospice UK \u2013 provides information about hospice care and how to find a hospice.\n\n\n\nThe impact of cervical cancer on your daily life will depend on the stage of cancer and the treatment you're having.\nMany women with cervical cancer have a radical hysterectomy. This is a major operation\u00a0that takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from. During this time, you need to avoid strenuous tasks and lifting, such as\u00a0lifting children\u00a0or\u00a0heavy shopping bags.\nYou won't be able to drive for 3 to 8 weeks after the operation. Most women will also need 8 to 12 weeks off work to recover after having a radical hysterectomy.\nSome of the treatments for cervical cancer can make you very tired, particularly\u00a0chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Because of this, you may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while.\nDon't be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it. Practical help may also be available from your local authority. Ask your doctor or nurse about who to contact.\u00a0\nWork\nHaving cervical cancer doesn't necessarily mean you'll have to give up work, although\u00a0you may need quite a lot of time off. During treatment, you may not be able to carry on as you did before.\nIf you have cancer, you're covered by the Disability Discrimination Act. This means that your employer isn't allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make 'reasonable adjustments' to help you cope. Examples of these include:\n\nallowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments\nallowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform, or your working environment\n\nThe definition of what's 'reasonable' depends on the situation, such as how much it would affect your employer's business, for example.\nYou should give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you'll need off and when. Speak to\u00a0a member of your human resources department, if you have one. Your union or staff association representative can also give you advice.\nIf you're having difficulties with your employer, your union or local Citizens Advice Bureau may be able to help.\nMacmillan Cancer Support\u00a0also has more information and advice about work and cancer.\nMoney and benefits\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. If you have cancer or you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. For example:\n\nif you have a job but can't work because of your illness, you're entitled to\u00a0Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\nif you don't have a job and can't work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\nif you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer's Allowance\nyou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income\n\nIt's a good idea to find out what help is available as soon as possible. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who can give you the information you need.\nYour sex life\nMany women feel nervous about having sex soon after treatment for cervical cancer, but it's perfectly safe.\u00a0Sex won't make the cancer come back and your partner can't catch cancer from you.\nIf\u00a0you want to, you can resume your normal sex life within a few weeks of finishing radiotherapy or having surgery. This will give your body time to heal.\nIf you're having chemotherapy,\u00a0male partners should wear a\u00a0condom when you have sex, because it's not clear if having sex after chemotherapy can have an effect on them.\nSome women find sex difficult after being treated for cervical cancer, because the\u00a0side effects of some treatments can include vaginal dryness and narrowing of the vagina. In these cases, there are treatments that can help, such as vaginal dilators.\u00a0\nSee complications of cervical cancer\u00a0for more information\nMacmillan Cancer Support\u00a0has more information on\u00a0how treatment for cervical cancer may affect your sex life.\n\n\nThere's no single way to completely prevent cervical cancer, but there are things that can reduce your risk.\nSafer sex\nMost cases of cervical cancer are linked to an infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV can be spread through unprotected sex, so using a\u00a0condom can reduce your risk of developing the infection. However, the virus isn't just passed on through penetrative sex \u2013 it can be transmitted during other types of sexual contact, such as skin-to-skin contact between genital areas and by using sex toys.\nYour risk of developing an HPV infection increases the earlier you start having regular sex and with the more sexual partners you have, although women who have only had 1 sexual partner can also develop it.\nRead more about sexual health\nCervical screening\nRegular\u00a0cervical screening\u00a0is the best way to identify abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix at an early stage.\nCervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland between the ages of 25 and 64 every 5 years.\nYou may be recalled more often depending on your test results.\nMake sure that your GP surgery has your up-to-date contact details, so that you continue getting screening invitations.\nIt's important that you attend your\u00a0cervical screening\u00a0tests, even if you've been vaccinated for HPV, because the vaccine doesn't guarantee protection against cervical cancer.\nIf you've been treated for abnormal cervical cell changes, you'll be invited for screening more frequently for several years after treatment. How regularly you need to go will depend on how severe the cell change is.\nAlthough it can identify most abnormal cell changes in the cervix, cervical screening isn't always 100% accurate. Therefore,\u00a0you should report symptoms such as unusual vaginal bleeding to your GP, even if you've recently been tested.\nCervical cancer\u00a0vaccination\nThe NHS cervical cancer vaccination programme uses a vaccine called Gardasil. Gardasil protects against four types of HPV, including the 2 strains responsible for more than 70% of cervical cancers in the UK (HPV16 and HPV 18). It also prevents\u00a0genital warts.\nGirls are offered the\u00a0childhood immunisation programme. The vaccine is\u00a0given to girls when they're\u00a012\u00a0to 13 years old, with 3 doses given\u00a0over a 6-month period.\nAlthough the\u00a0HPV vaccine can significantly reduce the risk of cervical cancer, it doesn't guarantee that you won't develop the condition. You should still attend cervical screening tests, even\u00a0if you've had the vaccine.\nAvoid\u00a0smoking\nYou can reduce your chances of getting cervical cancer by not smoking. People who smoke are less able to get rid of the HPV infection from the body, which can develop into cancer.\nIf you decide to give up smoking, you\u00a0could\u00a0contact\u00a0the Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0on\u00a00800 84 84 84.\u00a0Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0is run by NHS 24 and is staffed by trained advisors who'll be able to give you expert advice.\nIf you want to give up smoking, but you don't want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms that you may experience after giving up.\nFor more information and advice on giving up smoking, see stopping smoking\u00a0and treatments for stopping smoking.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Chickenpox is a mild and common childhood illness that most children catch at some point.\nIt\u00a0causes a rash of red, itchy spots that\u00a0turn into\u00a0fluid-filled blisters. They then\u00a0crust over to form scabs,\u00a0which eventually drop off.\nSome children have\u00a0only\u00a0a few spots, but other children can have spots that cover their entire body. These are most likely to appear on the face, ears and scalp, under the arms, on the chest and belly, and on the arms and legs.\nRead more about the symptoms of chickenpox.\nChickenpox (known medically as varicella) is\u00a0caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. It's spread\u00a0quickly and easily from someone who is infected.\nRead more about the causes of chickenpox.\nChickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10.\u00a0In fact, chickenpox is so common in childhood that over 90% of adults are immune to the condition because they've had it before.\nChildren usually\u00a0catch chickenpox in winter and spring, particularly between March and May.\nWhat to do\nTo prevent spreading the infection,\u00a0keep children off nursery or school until all their spots have crusted over.\nChickenpox is infectious from 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0days before the rash starts, until all the blisters have crusted over (usually 5\u00a0to 6\u00a0days after the start of the rash).\nIf your child has chickenpox, try to\u00a0keep them\u00a0away from public areas\u00a0to avoid contact with people who may not have had it, especially people who are at risk of serious problems, such as newborn babies, pregnant women and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets).\nRead more about what you need to do to stop chickenpox spreading.\nChickenpox treatment\nChickenpox in children is\u00a0considered a\u00a0mild illness, but your child will probably feel pretty miserable\u00a0and irritable while they have it.\nYour child\u00a0may have\u00a0a fever for the first few days\u00a0of the illness. The spots can be incredibly itchy.\nThere is no\u00a0specific treatment for chickenpox, but there are\u00a0pharmacy remedies that can\u00a0alleviate symptoms. These include\u00a0paracetamol to relieve fever, and calamine lotion\u00a0and cooling\u00a0gels to ease itching.\nIn most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within one to two weeks.\nRead more about chickenpox treatments.\nWhen to see a doctor\nFor most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own.\nHowever, some children can become more seriously ill with chickenpox and need to see a doctor.\nContact your GP straight away if your child develops any abnormal symptoms, such as:\n\nif the blisters on their skin become infected\u00a0\nif your child\u00a0has a\u00a0pain in their chest or has difficulty breathing\n\nChickenpox in adults\nChickenpox\u00a0may be a childhood illness, but adults can get it too. Chickenpox\u00a0tends to\u00a0be\u00a0more severe\u00a0in adults than children, and adults have\u00a0a higher risk of developing complications.\nAdults with chickenpox should stay off work until all the spots have crusted over. They should seek medical advice if they develop any abnormal symptoms, such as infected blisters.\nAdults with chickenpox may benefit from taking antiviral medicine if treatment is started early in the course of the illness. Read more about antivirals in the treatment of chickenpox.\nWho's at special risk?\nSome children and adults\u00a0are at special\u00a0risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox. They include:\n\npregnant women\nnewborn babies\npeople with a weakened immune system\n\nThese people should seek medical advice as soon as they are exposed to the chickenpox virus or they develop chickenpox symptoms.\nThey may need a\u00a0blood test to check if they are protected from (immune to) chickenpox.\nRead more about immunity testing and the diagnosis of chickenpox\u00a0in people at special risk.\nChickenpox in pregnancy\nChickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies. It can cause serious complications for both the pregnant woman and her baby. See\u00a0complications of chickenpox for further information\u00a0on what to do if you are exposed to\u00a0chickenpox during pregnancy.\nChickenpox and shingles\nOnce you have had\u00a0chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection\u00a0and become immune to catching it again. However,\u00a0the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, remains inactive (dormant) in\u00a0your body's nerve tissues and can return\u00a0later in life as an illness called shingles.\nIt's possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around.\nRead more about shingles.\nIs there a vaccine against chickenpox?\nThere is a\u00a0chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. The vaccine is only offered to children\u00a0and adults who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox complications.\nThe recommended 2\u00a0doses of the vaccine is estimated to offer 98% protection from chickenpox in children and 75% protection in adolescents and adults.\nSo it may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination. Similarly, there is a chance that someone who has received the vaccine could develop chickenpox after coming in close contact with a person who has shingles.\n\n\nThe most commonly recognised chickenpox symptom is a spotty, blistering red rash that can cover the entire body.\nChickenpox spots\nThe\u00a0spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be:\n\nbehind the ears\non the face\nover the scalp\non the chest and belly\non the arms and legs\n\nHowever, the spots can be anywhere on the body, even inside the ears and mouth, on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet and inside the nappy area.\nAlthough the\u00a0rash starts as small, itchy red spots, these develop a\u00a0blister on top and become\u00a0intensely itchy after about 12-14 hours.\nAfter a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over.\nAfter 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally.\nNew spots\u00a0can keep appearing in waves for 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0days after the rash begins. Therefore, different clusters of spots may be at different stages of blistering or drying out.\u00a0\nRead more about how to ease the itchiness and other symptoms of chickenpox in our section on chickenpox treatments.\nFind out what you can do to stop chickenpox spreading.\nFeeling unwell\nBefore the\u00a0rash appears, you or your child may\u00a0have some mild flu-like symptoms, including:\n\nfeeling sick\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over\naching, painful muscles\nheadache\ngenerally feeling unwell\nloss of appetite\n\nThese flu-like symptoms, especially the fever, tend to be more common and worse in adults than in children.\nUnusual symptoms\nMost healthy children (and adults) recover from chickenpox with no lasting ill-effects simply by resting, just as with a cold or the flu.\nHowever, some children and\u00a0adults are unlucky and have a more severe bout.\nContact your GP straight away if you or your child develop any abnormal symptoms, such as:\n\nthe skin surrounding the blisters\u00a0becoming red and painful\u00a0\npain in the chest or difficulty breathing\nsigns of dehydration, such as fewer wet nappies, drowsiness and cold hands and feet\n\nIn cases such as this, prescription medicine\u00a0or hospital treatment may be needed.\nRead more about chickenpox complications.\n\n\nChickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. You catch it by coming into contact with someone who is infected.\nChickenpox is a very contagious infection. Around 90% of people who have not previously had chickenpox will become infected when they come into contact with the virus.\nHow you catch\u00a0the virus\nThe chickenpox virus is spread most easily from someone who has the rash. The blisters are very itchy and break open easily,\u00a0which can contaminate surfaces or objects. The virus may then be transferred by touching the surface or object, then touching your face.\nThe virus is also\u00a0contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth\u00a0when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This can also contaminate surfaces or objects.\nIt normally takes\u00a014 days for the symptoms of chickenpox\u00a0to show after you have come into contact with the virus. However, this can vary from person to person \u2013 from as little as 7 days, up to 21 days.\u00a0This is called the \"incubation period\".\nSomeone\u00a0with chickenpox is most infectious from 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0days before the rash appears, until all the blisters have crusted over. This usually takes 5\u00a0to 6\u00a0days\u00a0from the start of the rash.\nRead more about the diagnosis of chickenpox\u00a0and how to stop chickenpox spreading.\nShingles\nIf you have not had chickenpox before,\u00a0you can also\u00a0catch chickenpox from someone\u00a0with shingles (an infection caused by the same virus). However, it's not possible to catch shingles from someone who has chickenpox.\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0shingles.\n\n\nYou or your child should not usually need any medical tests to diagnose chickenpox. You can be pretty sure that it is chickenpox if there are the key symptoms of a mild fever followed by an itchy rash, with blisters and scabs.\nChickenpox\u00a0spots are\u00a0usually\u00a0distinctive enough\u00a0to distinguish from other rashes, although they can be confused with other conditions that affect the skin, such as insect bites\u00a0or scabies (another contagious skin condition that causes intense itching).\nIf\u00a0you're uncertain\u00a0about what is causing the symptoms, your GP can carry out a simple blood test to identify the virus.\nFind your local GP surgery.\nWhen to contact your GP\n1. See your GP if you're not sure whether you or your child have chickenpox.\n2. Contact your GP\u00a0urgently if you have been in contact with someone who has chickenpox, or you have chickenpox symptoms and:\n\nyou are pregnant\nyou have a weakened immune system (the body\u2019s defence system)\nyour baby is less than 4\u00a0weeks old\n\nChickenpox in these\u00a0instances can cause serious complications, if left untreated. It is essential to seek medical advice so that you can receive any necessary treatment.\n3.\u00a0Contact your GP if you have chickenpox and are breastfeeding. They can advise about whether you should continue breastfeeding your baby.\nHaving a blood test\nOnce you have contacted your GP,\u00a0you\u00a0may need\u00a0a test\u00a0to see if you're already\u00a0immune from chickenpox.\nIf you have had chickenpox in the past, it is extremely unlikely that you will develop chickenpox for a second time. If you've never had chickenpox, or you're unsure whether you've had it, you may need an immunity\u00a0test.\nThis is a\u00a0blood test that checks whether you are producing the antibodies to the chickenpox virus.\nIf your blood test result shows that you have the antibodies, you'll be naturally protected from the virus. If you don't have the antibodies, you'll need to be monitored closely to see if you develop chickenpox symptoms. If\u00a0you do, further treatment may be needed.\nRead more about chickenpox treatment.\n\n\nThere is no cure for chickenpox, and the virus usually clears up by itself without any treatment.\nHowever, there are ways of easing the itch and discomfort, and there are important steps you can take to stop chickenpox spreading.\nPainkillers\nIf your child is in pain or has a high temperature (fever), you can give them a mild painkiller, such as paracetamol\u00a0(available over the counter in pharmacies). Always read the manufacturer's dosage instructions.\nParacetamol is the preferred painkiller for treating the associated symptoms of chickenpox. This is due to a very small risk of\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as\u00a0ibuprofen, causing adverse skin reactions during chickenpox.\u00a0\nAvoid giving your child ibuprofen if they have asthma\u00a0or a history of stomach problems. If you're not sure whether ibuprofen\u00a0is suitable, check with your GP or pharmacist. If your child is younger than 3\u00a0months old, you should always speak to your GP before giving your child any kind of pain relief.\nNever\u00a0give your child aspirin if you suspect or know\u00a0that they have chickenpox.\nIf you're pregnant and need to take painkillers, then paracetamol is the first choice. You can use it\u00a0at any stage of pregnancy. Only take ibuprofen\u00a0during the second trimester (weeks 14-27 of the pregnancy).\nIf you're pregnant and have chickenpox, you should visit your GP as soon as possible. You may need to have antiviral medicine or immunoglobulin treatment to prevent your symptoms\u00a0from getting worse.\nKeeping hydrated\nIt is important\u00a0for children (and adults) with chickenpox\u00a0to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Sugar-free ice lollies\u00a0are a good way of getting fluids into children. They also help to soothe a sore mouth that has chickenpox spots in it.\u00a0\nAvoid anything that may make the\u00a0mouth sore, such as salty foods. Soup is easy to swallow as long as it is not too hot.\nStop the scratching\nChickenpox can be incredibly itchy, but it's important\u00a0for children (and adults)\u00a0to not scratch the spots, to avoid future scarring.\nOne\u00a0way of stopping scratching is to keep fingernails clean and short. You can also\u00a0put socks over your child's hands at night to stop them scratching the rash as they sleep.\nIf your child's skin is very itchy or sore, try using calamine lotion or cooling gels.\u00a0These are\u00a0available in pharmacies and are\u00a0very safe to use. They have a soothing, cooling effect.\nA stronger medicine called chlorphenamine\u00a0can also help\u00a0to relieve the itching.\u00a0It's available from your pharmacist over the counter or it can be\u00a0prescribed by your GP.\u00a0Chlorphenamine is\u00a0taken by mouth and is suitable for children over 1\u00a0year old.\nCool clothing\nIf your child has a fever, or if their skin is sore and aggravated, dress them appropriately so that they don't get too hot or too cold. Loose-fitting, smooth, cotton fabrics are best and\u00a0will help stop the skin from becoming sore and irritated.\nIf your child has chickenpox, avoid sponging them down with cool water. This can make your child too cold and may make them shiver.\nStronger treatments\nAciclovir is an antiviral medicine that is sometimes given to people with chickenpox.\nAciclovir may be prescribed to:\n\npregnant women\nadults, if they visit their GP within 24 hours of the rash appearing\nnewborn babies\npeople with a weakened immune system (the body\u2019s defence system)\n\nIdeally, aciclovir needs to be started within 24 hours of\u00a0the rash appearing. It does not cure chickenpox, but it makes the symptoms less severe. You\u00a0normally need to take the medicine as tablets 5\u00a0times a day for 7\u00a0days.\nIf you are taking aciclovir, make sure you drink plenty of fluids. Side effects are rare, but can include nausea and diarrhoea.\nImmunoglobulin is a solution of antibodies that is taken from healthy donors. Varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) contains antibodies to the chickenpox virus.\nImmunoglobulin treatment is given by injection. It is not used to treat chickenpox, but to protect people who are at high risk\u00a0of developing a severe chickenpox infection. This includes:\n\npregnant women\nnewborn babies\npeople with weakened immune systems\n\nIn the case of pregnant women, immunoglobulin treatment also reduces the risk of the unborn baby becoming infected.\nAs the supply of VZIG is limited, it will only be considered if a high-risk person has:\n\nbeen significantly exposed to the virus \u2013 significant exposure could be face-to-face contact with someone who has chickenpox\nbeen in the same room for 15 minutes with someone who has chickenpox\nhad a blood test to confirm that\u00a0they've not had chickenpox before\n\nIn some cases, newborn babies may be given immunoglobulin treatment without having a blood test first.\nRead more about the complications of chickenpox.\n\n\nComplications of chickenpox are rare in healthy children. The most common complication is where the blisters become infected with bacteria.\nA sign that the\u00a0blisters have become infected is when the surrounding skin becomes red and sore.\nIf you think that your child's blisters have become infected, contact your GP as the child may need a course of antibiotics.\nOther complications in children\nVery rarely, chickenpox can lead to more serious complications involving the nervous system (brain and spinal cord) in children.\nThese include infections of the brain (encephalitis), the protective membranes around the brain (meningitis) or part of the brain called the cerebellum (cerebellitis).\nSigns of these problems can include:\n\na lack of energy\ndrowsiness\nconfusion\nseizures (fits)\nvomiting\nsevere\u00a0headaches\na\u00a0stiff neck\nbehavioural changes\nproblems with walking, balance or speech (ataxia)\n\nSeek medical advice as soon as possible if your child develops any of these symptoms after having chickenpox.\nAt-risk groups\nThe people who are most at risk of developing chickenpox complications are:\n\nadults\npregnant women\nbabies under four weeks old\npeople with a weakened immune system\u00a0\n\nChickenpox can be more serious in adults than in children. Adults with the virus are more likely to be admitted into hospital. Approximately 5-14% of adults with chickenpox develop lung problems, such as\u00a0pneumonia. If you smoke,\u00a0your risk of developing lung problems is much higher.\nAlthough it is more serious in adults, most people will still make a full recovery from the chickenpox virus.\nIf you're pregnant, chickenpox can occasionally cause complications.\nFor example, your risk of developing\u00a0pneumonia is slightly higher if you're pregnant, especially if you smoke. The further you are into your pregnancy, the more serious the risk of pneumonia tends to be.\nIf you get chickenpox while you're pregnant, there is also\u00a0a small but significant\u00a0risk to your unborn baby.\nIf you are infected with chickenpox during the first 28 weeks of your pregnancy, there is a risk that your unborn baby could develop a condition known as foetal varicella syndrome (FVS).\nThis syndrome is rare. The risk of it occurring in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is less than 1%. Between weeks 13 and 20, the risk is 2%.\nThere have only been a few reports of FVS due to an infection from weeks 20 to 28 of pregnancy, and the risk is thought to be much less than 1%.\nFVS can cause serious complications, including:\n\nscarring\u00a0\neye defects, such as cataracts\nshortened limbs\nbrain damage\n\nThere are also other risks\u00a0from catching chickenpox after week 20\u00a0of pregnancy.\nIt's possible that your baby may be born prematurely (before week 37 of the pregnancy).\nIf you are infected with chickenpox 7\u00a0days before or 7\u00a0days after giving birth, your newborn baby may develop a more serious type of chickenpox. In a few severe cases, this\u00a0type of chickenpox can be fatal.\nSee your GP urgently if you're pregnant or have given birth in the last 7\u00a0days and you think you may have chickenpox, or if you've been\u00a0exposed to someone who has chickenpox.\nYour\u00a0immune system is\u00a0your body's way of defending itself against disease, bacteria and viruses.\nIf your immune system is weak or does not\u00a0work properly, you are more susceptible to developing infections such as chickenpox. This is because your body produces fewer antibodies to fight off the infection.\nYou may have a weakened immune system if you take immunosuppressive medication.\nImmunosuppressive medication such as steroid tablets may be used\u00a0if, for\u00a0example,\u00a0you have an\u00a0inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or certain blood conditions.\nIf you have a weakened immune system, you're also more at risk of developing complications from chickenpox. These complications include:\n\npneumonia\nblood poisoning (septicaemia)\nmeningitis\n\nSee your GP urgently if you have a weakened immune system and you've been\u00a0exposed to the chickenpox virus.\nFor more information, read about how to stop the spread of chickenpox.\n\n\nIf your child has chickenpox,it is recommended that you inform their school or nursery, and keep them at home for 5\u00a0days.\nIf you have chickenpox, stay\u00a0off work and at home\u00a0until you're no longer infectious,\u00a0which is\u00a0until the last\u00a0blister has burst and crusted over. This usually happens five or six days after the rash begins.\nIt is a good idea for anyone who has chickenpox to avoid contact with:\n\npregnant women\nnewborn babies\nanyone who has a weak immune system, such as people who are having chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer) or taking steroid tablets\n\nIf you or your child have recently been exposed to the chickenpox virus, you may not be able to visit friends or relatives in hospital. Telephone the ward to check first.\nTravelling on a plane\u00a0\nIf you or your child have chickenpox, you may not be allowed to fly until 6\u00a0days after the last spot has appeared.\nYou and your child should be safe to fly once you're past the infectious stage and all of the blisters have crusted over. However, it's best to check the policy of your airline first. Inform the airline as soon as chickenpox is diagnosed.\nIt is also important to let your travel insurer know if you or your child has chickenpox. You need to make sure that you'll be covered if you have to delay or cancel your holiday, or if you need to extend your stay until your child is well enough to fly home.\nStop the virus spreading\nChickenpox can sometimes be spread through contact with objects that have been contaminated with the virus, such as children's toys, bedding or clothing.\nIf someone in your household has chickenpox, you can help stop the virus spreading by\u00a0wiping any objects or surfaces with a sterilising solution and making sure that any infected clothing or bedding is washed regularly.\nVaccination\nThere is a chickenpox vaccine that is used to protect people who are most at risk of a serious chickenpox infection or of\u00a0passing the infection on to someone who is at risk.\nPeople who may be considered for chickenpox vaccination include:\n\nhealthcare workers who are not already immune \u2013 for example, a nurse who has never had chickenpox and who may pass it to someone they are treating if they become infected\npeople living with someone who has a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, the child of a parent receiving chemotherapy\n\nThe vaccine is not suitable for pregnant women. Avoid getting pregnant for 3\u00a0months after having the vaccine. The vaccine is also not suitable for people with weakened immune systems.\nThe recommended 2\u00a0doses of the vaccine is estimated to offer 98% protection from chickenpox in children and 75% protection in adolescents and adults.\nSo it may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively.\nCKD does not usually cause symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage. It's usually detected at earlier stages by blood and urine tests.\nSymptoms of advanced kidney disease\nThe main symptoms of advanced kidney disease include:\n\ntiredness\nswollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)\nshortness of breath\nnausea\nblood in the urine\n\nRead more about the symptoms of chronic kidney disease\nDiagnosing chronic kidney disease\nChronic kidney disease is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests.\nIf you're at a high risk of developing CKD, you may be screened annually. Screening may be recommended if you have:\n\nhigh blood pressure\u00a0(hypertension)\ndiabetes\na family history of CKD\n\nRead more about diagnosing chronic kidney disease\nWhy does it happen?\nThe kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs, the size of your fist. They're located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter waste products from the blood before converting them into urine. The kidneys also:\n\nhelp maintain blood pressure\u00a0\nmaintain the correct levels of chemicals in your body which, in turn, will help\u00a0heart and muscles function properly\nproduce the active form of vitamin D that keeps bones healthy\u00a0\nproduce a substance called erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells\n\nChronic kidney disease is the reduced ability of the kidney to carry out these functions in the long-term. This is most often caused by damage to the kidneys from other conditions, most commonly diabetes and high blood pressure.\nRead more about the causes of chronic kidney disease\nWho is affected?\nCKD is common and\u00a0mainly associated with ageing. The older you get, the more likely you are to have some degree of kidney disease.\nIt's estimated that about 1 in 5 men and 1 in 4 women between the ages of 65 and 74 has some degree of CKD.\nCKD is more common in people of south Asian origin (those from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) and black people than the general population. The reasons for this include higher rates of diabetes in south Asian\u00a0people and higher rates of high blood pressure in African or Caribbean people.\nTreating chronic kidney disease\nThere is no cure for chronic kidney disease, although treatment can slow or halt the progression of the disease and can prevent other serious conditions developing.\nPeople with CKD are known to have an increased risk of a heart attack because of changes that occur to the circulation.\nIn\u00a0a\u00a0minority of people, CKD may cause kidney failure, also known as established renal failure (ERF) or end-stage kidney disease. In this situation, the usual functions of the kidney stop working.\nTo survive, people with ERF may need to have artificial kidney treatment, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant.\nRead more about treating chronic kidney disease\nA kidney transplant from a living donor can be planned to avoid or reduce the time someone is on dialysis. This can offer a better long term outcome for the person receiving the organ.\nThere are 2 types of living kidney donation:\n\ndirected donation \u2013 a person can donate a kidney to someone they know, like a family member or a friend\naltruistic kidney donation \u2013 a person can donate a kidney anonymously to someone they do not know\n\nFurther information about living donation.\nLiving with chronic kidney disease\nBeing diagnosed with chronic kidney disease can be worrying, but support and advice are available to help you cope.\nRead more about living with chronic kidney disease\nPreventing chronic kidney disease\nThe main way to reduce the chances of CKD developing is to ensure any existing conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, are carefully managed.\nSome lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of CKD developing, these include:\n\nhaving a healthy diet\navoiding drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\nexercising regularly\navoiding medicines that can damage the kidney\n\nRead more about preventing chronic kidney disease\n\n\nMost people with CKD have no symptoms because the body can tolerate even a large reduction in kidney function.\nIn other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. Kidney function is often sufficient if only one kidney is working. That is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant.\nA change in kidney function is usually discovered through a routine blood or urine test. If you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your kidney function will be monitored with regular blood and urine\u00a0tests, and treatment aims to keep any symptoms to a minimum.\nIf the kidneys continue to lose function and there is progression towards kidney failure (established renal failure or ERF), this will usually be tracked by blood tests and monitoring. If kidney failure does occur, the symptoms may include:\n\nweight loss and poor appetite\nswollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)\u00a0\nshortness of breath\u00a0\nblood or protein in your urine (protein in your urine is not something you will notice as it can only be detected during a urine test)\u00a0\nan increased need to urinate, particularly at night\u00a0\ninsomnia\nitchy skin\u00a0\nmuscle cramps\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nnausea\u00a0\nerectile dysfunction in men\u00a0(an inability to get or maintain an erection)\n\nThese are general symptoms and can be caused by many less serious conditions. Many of the symptoms\u00a0above can be avoided if treatment begins at an early stage, before any symptoms appear.\nIf you are worried by any of the symptoms above, arrange to see your GP.\nWant to know more?\n\nNational Kidney Federation: Symptoms and Problems\n\n\n\nKidney disease is most often caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys.\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes are the most common causes of kidney disease. The evidence indicates that high blood pressure causes just over a quarter of all cases of kidney failure. Diabetes has been established as the cause of around a quarter of all cases.\nHigh blood pressure\nBlood pressure is a measure of the pressure your heart generates in your arteries with each pulse. Too much pressure can damage your body's organs, leading to heart disease, stroke and worsening of kidney function.\nThe cause of around 90% of cases of high blood pressure is unknown, although there appears to be a link between the condition and a person\u2019s general health, diet, and lifestyle.\nKnown risk factors for high blood pressure include:\n\nage (the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older)\u00a0\nfamily history of high blood pressure (the condition seems to run in families)\u00a0\nbeing of African-Caribbean or south Asian origin\u00a0\nobesity\u00a0\nlack of exercise\u00a0\nsmoking\nexcessive alcohol consumption\u00a0\nhigh amount of salt in your diet\nhigh-fat diet\u00a0\nstress\n\nHypertension causes damage by putting strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys. This prevents the filtering process from working properly.\nDiabetes\nDiabetes is a condition in which the body produces no \u2013 or too little \u2013 insulin (type 1 diabetes) or has become unable to make effective use of insulin (type 2 diabetes).\nInsulin is needed to regulate\u00a0levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood, preventing the levels going too high after a meal and too low between meals.\nIf diabetes is poorly controlled, too much glucose can build up in your blood. The glucose can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys, which affects the ability of your kidneys to filter out waste products and fluids.\nIt is estimated that 20-40% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop kidney disease before they reach 50 years of age. Around 30% of people with type 2 diabetes also show signs of developing kidney damage.\nThe first sign of diabetic kidney disease is the appearance of low levels of protein in the urine. Therefore, your GP will ask for an annual urine test so any kidney disease can be detected as early as possible.\nAll people with diabetes should have a kidney check every year. Early detection of kidney dysfunction in diabetes is important because it identifies people at risk or complications, such as eye problems and impotence.\nOther causes\nThere are many other conditions that less commonly cause CKD, including:\n\nglomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney)\u00a0\npyelonephritis (infection in the kidney)\u00a0\npolycystic kidney disease (an inherited condition where both kidneys are larger than normal due to the gradual growth of masses of cysts)\u00a0\nfailure of normal kidney development in an unborn baby while developing in the womb\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (a condition of the immune system where the body attacks the kidney as if it were foreign tissue)\nlong-term, regular use of medicines, such as lithium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin and ibuprofen\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nblockages, for example due to kidney stones or prostate disease\n\n\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests.\nScreening\nIf you are in a high-risk group for developing CKD, it is important\u00a0to be regularly screened for the condition. People who are not in a high-risk group are not normally screened for CKD.\nAnnual screening is recommended for the following groups:\n\npeople with high blood pressure (hypertension)\u00a0\npeople with diabetes \npeople with\u00a0acute kidney injury caused by medications such as lithium or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, kidney stones or an enlarged prostate\npeople with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart, arteries and veins, such as coronary heart disease or heart failure)\u00a0\npeople with a family history of stage five CKD (see below for more information about staging) or an inherited kidney disease\npeople with diseases that affect several parts of the body and may affect the kidneys, such as systemic lupus erythematosus\npeople with blood in the urine (haematuria) or protein in the urine (proteinuria) where there is no known cause\n\nYour GP can advise you about whether or not you should be screened for CKD.\nMost often, the diagnosis of kidney disease is made because a routine blood or urine test indicates the kidneys may not be functioning normally. If this happens, the test is usually repeated to\u00a0confirm the diagnosis.\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR)\nAn effective way of assessing how well your kidneys are working is to calculate your glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is a measurement of how many millilitres (ml) of waste fluid your kidneys can filter from the blood in a minute (measured in ml/min). A healthy pair of kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml/min.\nIt is difficult to measure the GFR directly, so it is estimated using a formula. The result is called the estimated GFR or eGFR. Calculating your eGFR involves taking a blood sample and measuring the levels of a waste product called creatinine and taking into account your age, gender and ethnic group. The result is similar to the percentage of normal kidney function. For example, an eGFR of 50ml/min equates to 50% kidney function.\nThe following tests are used to detect proteinuria (protein in the urine)\n\nurine tests \u2013 used to see whether there is blood or protein in your urine\nalbumin and creatinine testing \u2013 this is another urine test which compares the amounts of albumin (a protein) and creatinine in your urine. The ratio of the two (the albumin:creatinine ratio or ACR) can be used with eGFR to give doctors a more accurate idea of how the kidneys are functioning\n\nStaging\nA six-stage system, based on eGFR levels, is used to describe the progression of CKD. The higher the stage, the more severe the CKD. The six stages are described below.\n\nStage one (sometimes called G1): the eGFR is normal (above 90 or more), but other testing shows evidence of kidney damage.\nStage two (G2): the eGFR has decreased slightly (60\u201389), but is still considered to be in the normal range for a young adult.\n\nIf you have stage one or two CKD, it is recommended you have annual eGFR tests so the progression of the condition can be carefully monitored.\n\nStage three is divided into two\u00a0\u2013 stage 3a (G3a) and 3b (G3b). In stage 3a, the eGFR has decreased mildly (45\u201359) and this is termed a mild to moderate decrease in kidney function and should be checked annually. In stage 3b (G3b) it has decreased moderately (30\u201344) and is termed a moderate to severe reduction in kidney function and should be checked every six months.\u00a0\nStage four (G4): the eGFR has reduced severely (15-29). By this time, it is possible you will be experiencing symptoms of CKD. Further testing should be carried out every six months. \u00a0\nStage five (G5): the kidneys have lost almost all of their function (an eGFR of below 15), which is known as established\u00a0renal failure. Further testing should be carried out every three months.\n\nHowever, over time, GFR can fluctuate, so one abnormal test result does not automatically mean you have CKD. A diagnosis of CKD is usually only confirmed if repeated eGFR tests show your eGFR is consistently lower than normal over three months.\u00a0\nOther tests\nA number of other tests are also used to assess the levels of damage to your kidneys. These are outlined below:\n\nkidney scans, such as an ultrasound scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 used to find out whether there are any unusual blockages in your urine flow. In cases of advanced kidney disease, the kidneys are shrunken and have an uneven shape\nkidney biopsy \u2013 a small sample of kidney tissue is taken so that the cells can be examined under a microscope for damage\n\n\n\nLifestyle changes\nThe following lifestyle changes are known to help reduce your blood pressure and help control CKD:\n\nstopping smoking\neating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet\u00a0\nrestricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day\nnot\u00a0using over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional\nmoderating your alcohol intake\u00a0so it is within recommended limits (no more than 3-4 units a day for men and 2-3 units a day for women)\u00a0\nlosing weight if you are overweight or obese\u00a0\ndoing regular exercise\u00a0for at least 30 minutes a day, five times a week\n\nRead\u00a0more about preventing high blood pressure\u00a0through lifestyle changes.\nMedications for high blood pressure\nOne of the main ways to reduce the progression of kidney damage is to manage high blood pressure. Good control of blood pressure is\u00a0vital to protect the kidneys.\nPeople with CKD should aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmHg but if you also have diabetes you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmHg.\nThere are many types of blood pressure drugs.\u00a0Medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure in people with CKD.\nAs well as reducing blood pressure around the body and reducing the strain on blood vessels,\u00a0ACE inhibitors\u00a0give additional protection to the kidney.\nACE inhibitors include:\n\nramipril\u00a0\nenalapril\u00a0\nlisinopril\u00a0\nperindopril\n\nSide effects of ACE inhibitors include:\n\na persistent, dry cough\u00a0\ndizziness\u00a0\ntiredness or weakness\u00a0\nheadaches\n\nMost of these side effects should pass within a few days, although some people continue to have a dry cough.\nIf the side effects of ACE inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given an alternative medication called an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB).\u00a0This group of medicines includes:\n\ncandesartan\neprosartan\nirbesartan\nazilsartan\nolmesartan\ntemisartan\nvalsartan\nlosartan\n\nThe side effects of ARBs are uncommon, but can include dizziness.\nBoth ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause a reduction in kidney function in some people\u00a0and increased levels of potassium in the blood, so blood tests will need to be performed after you start treatment and whenever the dose changes. If you are on an ACE inhibitor or ARB and you develop a fever/infection or need medicines for other conditions, it's important to ask your doctor if the ACE inhibitor or ARB needs to be temporarily stopped.\nMedication to reduce cholesterol\nStudies have shown that people with CKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. This is because some of the risk factors for CKD are the same as those for heart attacks and strokes, including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (atherosclerosis).\nStatins are a type of medication used to lower cholesterol levels. Cholesterol causes narrowing of the arteries that can lead to a blockage of the blood supply to the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). Statins work by blocking the effects of an enzyme in your liver (called HMG-CoA reductase), which is used to make cholesterol.\nStatins sometimes have mild side effects, including:\n\nconstipation\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nheadaches\u00a0\nabdominal pain\n\nOccasionally, statins can cause muscle pain, weakness and tenderness. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your GP. You\u00a0may need to have a blood test or change your treatment.\nIf you have kidney disease, you may be asked to reduce your daily fluid and salt intake. You may develop a build-up of fluid as your kidneys will not be able to get rid of fluid as well as they did before.\nIf you are asked to reduce the amount of fluid you drink, you must also take into account fluid in foods, such as soup and yoghurt. Your GP or dietitian can advise you about this.\nThe excess fluid that occurs as a result of kidney disease often builds up in your ankles or around your lungs. You may also be given diuretics (water tablets), such as furosemide, which will help get rid of the excess fluid from your body.\nIf you do not have any fluid retention and you\u00a0have not\u00a0been told\u00a0to reduce your fluid intake, there is no need to do so.\u00a0In fact, it could be harmful in some circumstances.\nAnaemia\nMany people with stage three, four and five CKD develop anaemia. Anaemia is a condition in which you do not have enough red blood cells. Symptoms of anaemia include:\n\ntiredness\u00a0\nlethargy\u00a0\nshortness of breath (dyspnoea)\u00a0\npalpitations (awareness of heartbeat)\u00a0\n\nAnaemia can occur because of many other conditions and your doctor will investigate to rule out\u00a0other possible causes.\nMost people with kidney disease will be given iron supplements because iron is needed for the production of red blood cells. To boost iron levels, iron may be given as tablets, such as daily ferrous sulphate tablets, or as occasional intravenous infusions.\nIf this is not enough to treat anaemia, you may be started on injections of erythropoietin, a hormone which helps your body produce more red blood cells. These injections are often administered into a vein (intravenously)\u00a0or under the skin (subcutaneously). Examples of these injections include epoetin alfa, beta and zeta, darbepoetin and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.\nWant to know more?\n\nNICE: Treating anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease\n\nCorrection of phosphate balance\nIf you have stage four or five kidney disease, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it. Phosphate is a mineral that, with calcium, makes up most of your bones. Phosphate is obtained through diet, mainly dairy foods. The kidneys usually filter out\u00a0excess phosphate. If phosphate levels rise too much, it can upset the normal calcium balance of the body. This can lead to thinning of the bones and furring of the arteries.\nYou may be asked to limit the amount of phosphate in your diet. Foods\u00a0high in phosphate include red meat, dairy produce, eggs and fish. Your GP or dietitian should be able to advise you about how much phosphate you can eat. However, there is no advantage in reducing your intake of these foods unless you have a raised phosphate level.\u00a0Always ask\u00a0a healthcare professional before changing your diet.\nIf reducing the amount of phosphate in your diet does not lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. These medicines bind to the phosphate in the food inside your stomach and stop it from being absorbed into your body.\nTo work properly, phosphate binders must be taken just before meals. The most commonly used phosphate binder\u00a0is calcium carbonate, but there\u00a0are also alternatives that may be more suitable for\u00a0you.\nThe side effects of phosphate binders are uncommon but include:\n\nnausea\u00a0\nstomach ache\u00a0\nconstipation\u00a0\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nflatulence (wind)\u00a0\nskin rash\u00a0\nitchy skin\n\nVitamin D supplements\nPeople with kidney disease can have low levels of vitamin D, necessary for healthy bones. This is because the kidneys need to activate the vitamin D from food and\u00a0the sun before it can be used by the body.\nTreatment for kidney failure \u2013 transplant or dialysis\nMany people with kidney failure can continue with treatment using medicines and will have good-functioning kidneys for the rest of their lives.\nIn a few people, kidney disease will progress to the stage where the kidneys\u00a0stop working and it becomes life threatening. This is called kidney failure or established renal failure (ERF).\nThis rarely\u00a0happens suddenly, and there will be time to plan the next stage of your condition. The decision whether to have dialysis, a kidney transplant or supportive treatment should be discussed with your healthcare team.\nRead more about dialysis\u00a0and\u00a0kidney transplants.\nSupportive treatment\nIf you decide not to have dialysis or a transplant for kidney failure, or they are not suitable for you,\u00a0you will be offered supportive treatment.\nThis is also called palliative care.\nThe aim is to treat and control the symptoms of kidney failure without using dialysis or transplantation. Supportive treatment includes medical, psychological and practical care for both the person with kidney failure and their family, including discussion about how you feel and planning for the end of life.\nMany people choose supportive treatment because they:\n\nare unlikely to benefit or have quality of life with treatment\ndo not want to go through the inconvenience of treatment with dialysis\nare advised against dialysis because they have other serious illnesses that will shorten their life, and the negative aspects of treatment outweigh any likely benefits\u00a0\nhave been on dialysis but have decided to stop this treatment\u00a0\nare being treated with dialysis, but have another serious physical illness, especially severe heart disease or stroke, that will shorten their life\n\nIf you choose to have supportive treatment, your kidney unit will still look after you.\nDoctors and nurses will make sure you receive:\n\nmedicines to protect your remaining kidney function\u00a0for as long as possible\u00a0\nmedicines to treat other symptoms of kidney failure, such as feeling out of breath, anaemia, loss of appetite or itchy skin\u00a0\nhelp\u00a0to plan your home and money affairs\u00a0\nbereavement support for your family after your death\n\nWant to know more?\n\nKidney Research UK: Information on choosing not to start dialysis\nNational Kidney Federation:\u00a0End of life care for people with advanced kidney disease\nBereavement support from\u00a0CRUSE\n\nWhat is good kidney disease care?\nAccording to a national review, kidney disease services should:\n\nidentify people at risk of kidney disease, especially people with high blood pressure or diabetes, and treat them as early as possible to maintain their kidney function\u00a0\ngive people access to investigative treatment and follow them up to reduce the risk of the disease getting worse\u00a0\ngive people good-quality information about managing their condition\u00a0\nprovide information about the development of the disease and treatment options\u00a0\nprovide access to a specialist renal (kidney) team\u00a0\ngive people access to transplant or dialysis\u00a0services if required\nprovide supportive care\n\nYour treatment for kidney disease will need to be reviewed regularly.\nIt may be helpful for you to make a care plan because this can help you manage your day-to-day health. Your kidney disease specialist nurse may be able to help with this.\n\n\nIn most cases, chronic kidney disease (CKD) cannot be completely prevented, although you can take steps to reduce the chances of the condition developing.\nManaging your condition\nIf you have a chronic (long-term) condition, such as diabetes, that could potentially cause chronic kidney disease, it is important\u00a0it is carefully managed.\nFollow the advice of your GP and keep all appointments relating to your condition. People with diabetes are advised to have their kidney function tested every year.\nRead more about Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes\nSmoking\nSmoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, including\u00a0heart attacks or strokes, and it can increase the likelihood that any existing kidney problems will get worse.\nIf you stop smoking, you will improve your general health and reduce your risk of developing other serious conditions, such as lung cancer and heart disease.\nThe NHS smoking helpline can offer you advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking.\u00a0Call Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0on\u00a00800 84 84 84.\nRead more\u00a0about stopping smoking\nDiet\nA healthy diet is important\u00a0for preventing chronic kidney disease. It will lower the amount of cholesterol in your blood and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level. Eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 A DAY) and whole grains.\nLimit the amount of salt in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure. One teaspoonful of salt is equal to about 6g.\nAvoid eating foods high in saturated fat because this will increase your cholesterol level.\nFoods high in saturated fat include:\n\nmeat pies\u00a0\nsausages and fatty cuts of meat\u00a0\nbutter\u00a0\nghee (a type of butter often used in Indian cooking)\u00a0\nlard\u00a0\ncream\u00a0\nhard cheese\u00a0\ncakes and biscuits\u00a0\nfoods that contain coconut oil or palm oil\n\nEating some foods that are high in unsaturated fat can help decrease your cholesterol level. Foods\u00a0high in unsaturated fat include:\n\noily fish\u00a0\navocados\u00a0\nnuts and seeds\u00a0\nsunflower\u00a0oil\nrapeseed\u00a0oil\nolive oil\n\nRead more about\u00a0healthy food and diet\nAlcohol\nDrinking excessive amounts of alcohol will cause your blood pressure to rise, as well as raising cholesterol levels in your blood. Therefore, sticking to the recommended alcohol consumption limits is the best way to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure (hypertension) and CKD.\nThe recommended limits for alcohol are:\n\n3-4 units of alcohol a day for men\u00a0\n2-3 units of alcohol a day for women\n\nA unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal strength lager, a small glass of wine or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits.\nRead more about\u00a0alcohol\nExercise\nRegular exercise should help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing CKD.\nAt least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week, is recommended.\u00a0\nRead more about\u00a0health and fitness\nPainkillers\nKidney disease can be caused by the improper use (such as taking too many)\u00a0of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen.\nIf you need to take painkillers,\u00a0make sure you follow the instructions. This can help to avoid kidney damage.\n\n\nRelationships and support\nComing to terms with a condition such as kidney disease can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. It can be difficult to talk\u00a0to people about your condition, even if they are close to you.\nLearning about kidney disease often helps because you and your family will understand more about what to expect and feel more in control of the illness, instead of feeling that your lives are now dominated by kidney disease and its treatment.\nBe open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. However, do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.\nGet support\nYour GP or nurse can reassure you if you have questions about your kidney disease, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist telephone helpline operator. Your GP surgery will have information on these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to other people with kidney disease at a local support group or through an internet chat room.\nMoney and finances\nIf you have to stop work or work part time because of your kidney disease, you may find it hard to cope financially. You may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:\n\nif you have a job but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\nif you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\nif you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for Disability Living Allowance\nif you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to get Attendance Allowance\nif you are caring for someone with kidney disease, you may be entitled to Carer\u2019s Allowance\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nyou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income\n\nWant to know more?\n\nNational Kidney Federation: Benefits for renal patients and carers\nMoney Advice Service\n\nSex and pregnancy\nThe symptoms of kidney disease and the stress it causes in your life can affect your sexual relationships.\nSome couples become closer after a diagnosis of kidney disease, while others find that their loved ones are affected by worries about how they will cope with the effects of the illness. Both men and women may experience issues about body image and self-esteem, and this can affect the relationship.\nTry to share your feelings with your partner. If you have problems with sex that do not get better with time, speak to a counsellor or sex therapist.\nPeople on dialysis often experience specific sexual difficulties. Loss of sex drive in both men and women and impotence in men are commonly reported problems.\nTreatment is available, but\u00a0it may take some time and requires commitment from both partners. The first step is to discuss it with your healthcare team.\nWant to know more?\n\nNational Kidney Federation: Sex problems with renal failure\n\nPregnancy\nBoth men and women with early stage kidney disease will find\u00a0their fertility is unaffected. This means it is important to use contraception unless you want to have a baby.\nLater stage kidney disease may affect\u00a0women's periods, which can make pregnancy more difficult. For men, later stage kidney disease can cause a reduction in sperm count. However, having kidney disease does not mean you will not get pregnant or be able to father a child, so\u00a0both men and women\u00a0need to use an effective method of contraception unless they want to have a baby.\nWomen who want to have a baby should talk to their renal specialist or an obstetrician with an interest in kidney disease.\u00a0Depending on the stage of kidney disease, there can be risks to both the mother and the baby. It is important to minimise any risk with a planned pregnancy. Your healthcare team can advise you about this.\nWant to know more?\n\nNational Kidney Federation: Pregnancy with kidney failure and on dialysis\n\nHolidays and insurance\nIf you have mild kidney disease or you\u2019ve had a transplant, going on holiday shouldn\u2019t pose additional health problems, whether you're staying in the UK or going abroad.\nIf you\u2019re on dialysis, you can still enjoy holidays provided you book your treatment before you go away.\nIf you're on dialysis and want to travel, discuss your plans with your renal unit as early as you can. It can sometimes be more difficult to arrange dialysis in the UK than it is abroad.\nThe NHS will look after you if you get ill while on holiday in the UK. If you\u2019re in Europe, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) entitles you to free or reduced-cost hospital treatment.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to take out holiday health insurance in addition to carrying the EHIC. Anyone with kidney disease should declare it as a pre-existing medical condition on standard insurance application forms. It may exclude you from some policies.\u00a0\nWant to know more?\n\nNational Kidney Federation:\u00a0Health insurance for kidney patients\n\nUsing over-the-counter medicines\nSome remedies are potentially harmful for people with kidney disease. Make sure you check with your doctor before taking a new over the counter medicine.\nYou\u2019re at higher risk of being harmed by certain over the counter remedies if:\n\nyou have advanced kidney disease (stage 4 or 5, or a kidney function below 30% of normal)\nyou have mild-to-moderate kidney disease (stage 3 with a kidney function between 30 and 60% of normal) and are elderly with another serious illness, such as coronary heart disease\n\nWhat's safe and what's not\nSummarised below is a list of which over the counter remedies are safe for people with kidney disease to use and which should be avoided. This is just a guide. For more detailed information, consult your pharmacist, renal specialist or GP.\nParacetamol is safe and the best choice of painkiller to treat a headache, but avoid soluble products as they are high in sodium. If your kidney function is less than about 50%, avoid painkillers containing aspirin, ibuprofen or similar drugs such as diclofenac. These products can deteriorate the function of damaged kidneys. Low-dose aspirin of 75-150mg a day can be used if it's prescribed for the prevention of vascular disease. You should also avoid ibuprofen if you're taking anti-rejection treatment following a kidney transplant.\nMany of the products available for coughs and colds contain a mixture of ingredients, so check the packaging carefully. Some products contain paracetamol, which is safe, but others contain high doses of aspirin, which it's best to avoid.\nMany cold remedies also contain decongestants, which you should avoid if you have high blood pressure. The best way to clear congestion is by steam inhalation with menthol or eucalyptus. For coughs, try a simple linctus or glycerine honey and lemon to soothe your throat.\nIf you have muscle or joint pain, it's ideal to use topical preparations (applied to the skin), which are rubbed on to the painful area. Avoid tablets containing ibuprofen or similar drugs such as diclofenac if your kidney function is below 50%. Ibuprofen gel or spray is safer than ibuprofen tablets, but it isn\u2019t completely risk-free as a small amount of the drug penetrates the skin into the bloodstream.\nKidney failure\nAbout 1% of people with stage three CKD develop kidney failure, also called established renal failure (ERF). Kidney failure has a major impact on your life and the lives of those close to you. People diagnosed with kidney failure usually go through shock, grief and denial before they accept their condition.\nChoices if you have established renal failure\nIf you have established renal failure (ERF), you will need to decide whether to have treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant. You may decide to have neither treatment and to have supportive care. These choices should be made with your healthcare team.\nFor people who want active treatment for their ERF, a transplant would be the best option. However, a transplant is only suitable for about half of all people with ERF. This is because they may have had recent cancer or\u00a0are not physically fit.\nMany people who have slowly progressive kidney failure and other serious health problems, and who are usually older, may choose to avoid dialysis. Supportive care can still allow you to live for some time with a good quality of life.\nA kidney transplant, when suitable, is the best treatment for ERF. The transplanted kidney can be obtained from a deceased or living donor and survival rates are now extremely good. About 90% of transplants still function after five years and many transplants work usefully after 20 years. The main reason people have to wait for a transplant is the shortage of available donors.\nOver a third of kidney transplants are now from live donors. A live donor kidney can be transplanted before the need for dialysis, rather than after a period of time on dialysis.\nOne major risk after transplantation is rejection, where the immune system attacks the donated kidney because it mistakes it for a foreign object. This is prevented with the use of strong drugs to suppress the immune system. These drugs need to be taken meticulously. They are usually well tolerated but may have side effects, including an increased susceptibility to infections and some forms of cancer. For this reason, transplant patients are given regular reviews in a specialist transplant clinic.\nWant to know more?\n\nNational Kidney Federation: Transplantation\n\nDialysis\nDialysis can take place at home or in hospital. It involves filtering the blood of waste products and excess water. It is not as efficient as a human kidney, so people with kidney failure usually need to restrict their intake of fluid and certain foods. They also require additional medicines such as iron supplements, phosphate binders and antihypertensive medicine (to reduce blood pressure). There are two types of dialysis: peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.\nPeritoneal dialysis\nThe abdomen (tummy) has a lining called the peritoneal membrane, which can be used as a filter to remove excess waste and water. If you have opted for peritoneal dialysis, a tube (catheter) will be inserted into your abdomen during an operation. This will allow you to drain dialysis fluid in and out of your tummy yourself. You will not need to go into hospital to be treated, but you will have to spend an hour or two each day draining the fluid. The treatment involves either four exchanges spaced out during the day, each taking half an hour, or attaching yourself to a machine overnight that pumps the fluid in and out for you.\nHaemodialysis\nHaemodialysis removes waste products and excess fluid that build up in the body when the kidneys stop working. Blood is taken from the body to be cleaned in a filter known as a dialyser. It is effectively an artificial kidney. The whole process takes about four hours and usually has to be repeated three times a week. Most people go into hospital to have haemodialysis. However, some people choose to have the treatment in their own home.\nHome haemodialysis will give you more flexibility, but comes with greater responsibility. You\u2019ll need to have the space in your home for a dedicated machine and, in most cases, a lot of support from a close family member or friend. Some people choose to have their dialysis at night while they are asleep. Most people who choose home haemodialysis have it every day, so their fluid intake is not as restricted.\nQuality vascular access\nDuring haemodialysis, it is important that large volumes of blood are passed through the machine. This requires special measures to get into large enough blood vessels. For this reason, haemodialysis patients need a minor operation to join one of the deep arteries to a superficial vein (called a fistula). This is carried out in day surgery and should be done at least six weeks before dialysis is required because it needs time to mature before it can be used.\nOccasionally, there will be insufficient time for a fistula to be created before dialysis is required. In this case, a temporary solution is found, usually involving the use of an indwelling plastic dialysis catheter. A catheter is a surgical tube inserted into the body to allow for the transfer of fluid.\nAll the issues will be discussed in detail with you by the dialysis team before any decisions are made.\nWant to know more?\n\nRead more about dialysis\nNational Kidney Federation: Haemodialysis\nNational Kidney Federation: Peritoneal dialysis\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and tends to progress slowly over many years.\nIt mostly affects people over the age of 60 and is rare in people under 40.\u00a0Children are almost never affected.\nIn chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL),\u00a0the spongy material found inside some bones (bone marrow)\u00a0produces too many white blood cells called lymphocytes that\u00a0aren't fully developed and don't work properly.\nOver time this can cause a range of problems, such as an increased risk of picking up infections, persistent tiredness,\u00a0swollen glands\u00a0in the neck, armpits or groin, and unusual bleeding or bruising.\nCLL is different\u00a0from other types of leukaemia, including chronic myeloid leukaemia,\u00a0acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia.\nSymptoms of CLL\nCLL doesn't usually cause any symptoms early on and may only be picked up during a\u00a0blood test carried out for another reason.\nWhen symptoms develop, they may include:\n\ngetting infections\u00a0often\nanaemia\u00a0\u2013 persistent tiredness, shortness of breath and pale skin\nbleeding and bruising more easily than normal\na high temperature (fever)\nnight sweats\nswollen glands\u00a0in your\u00a0neck, armpits or groin\nswelling and discomfort in your tummy\nunintentional weight loss\n\nYou should speak to your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. These symptoms can have other causes other than cancer, but it's a good idea to get them checked out.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing CLL and complications of CLL.\nTreatments\u00a0for CLL\nAs CLL\u00a0progresses slowly and often has no symptoms at first, you may not need to be treated immediately.\nIf it's caught early on, you'll have regular check-ups over the following months or years\u00a0to see if it's getting any worse.\nIf CLL\u00a0starts to cause symptoms, or isn't diagnosed until later on, the main treatments are:\n\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 where medication\u00a0is taken as a tablet or given directly into a vein is used to destroy the cancerous cells\na stem cell or bone marrow transplant\u00a0\u2013 where donated cells called stem cells are transplanted into your body so you start to produce healthy white blood cells\n\nTreatment can't\u00a0usually cure\u00a0CLL completely, but can slow its progression and lead to\u00a0periods where there are no symptoms. Treatment may be repeated if the condition comes back.\nRead more about treating CLL.\nOutlook for CLL\nThe outlook for CLL depends on how advanced it is when it's diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and\u00a0your general health.\nYounger, healthier people who are diagnosed when\u00a0CLL is\u00a0still in the early stages generally have the best outlook.\nAlthough it can't normally be cured, treatment can help control the condition for many years.\nCauses of CLL\nIt's not clear what causes CLL. There's no proven link\u00a0with radiation or chemical exposure, diet or infections. You can't catch it from anyone else or pass it on.\nHowever, having certain genes can increase your chances of developing CLL. You may be at a slightly higher risk of it if you have a close family member with it, although this risk is still small.\n\n\nMost cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are detected during blood tests carried out for another reason.\nHowever, you should speak to your GP if you have worrying symptoms of CLL, such as\u00a0persistent tiredness, unusual bleeding or bruising, unexplained weight loss or night sweats.\nYour GP may:\n\nask about your symptoms and your medical and family history\ncarry out a physical examination to check for problems such as swollen glands and a swollen spleen\nsend off a blood\u00a0sample for testing\n\nIf\u00a0your GP\u00a0thinks you could have CLL, you'll be referred to a hospital doctor called a haematologist, a specialist in blood disorders, for further tests.\nBlood tests\nThe main test used to help diagnose CLL is a type of\u00a0blood test\u00a0called a full blood count.\nThis is where the number and appearance of the different blood cells in a sample of your blood are checked in a laboratory.\nAn abnormally high number of unusual white blood cells\u00a0(lymphocytes) can be a sign of\u00a0CLL. A detailed examination of these cells can usually confirm the diagnosis.\nX-rays and scans\nYou may also have:\n\na chest\u00a0X-ray\nan ultrasound\u00a0of your tummy\na\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan\n\nThese tests can check for problems caused by CLL, such as swollen glands\u00a0or\u00a0a swollen\u00a0spleen,\u00a0and help\u00a0rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\nBone marrow biopsy\nSometimes\u00a0the\u00a0haematologist\u00a0may\u00a0recommend removing a sample of your bone marrow\u00a0(bone marrow biopsy) so they can\u00a0examine it\u00a0under a microscope to check it for cancerous cells.\nThe sample is removed\u00a0using\u00a0a needle inserted into your hip bone. Local anaesthetic\u00a0is normally used to\u00a0numb the area where the needle is inserted, although you may experience some discomfort during the biopsy.\nThe procedure will\u00a0last around 15 minutes and you shouldn't need to stay in hospital overnight. You may\u00a0have some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards.\nLymph node biopsy\nIn some cases, removing and examining a swollen lymph gland can help confirm a diagnosis of CLL. This is known as a lymph node biopsy.\nThe gland is removed during a minor operation carried out under either local or\u00a0general anaesthetic, where you're asleep. You won't usually need to stay in hospital overnight.\nAfter the operation, you'll be left with a small wound that will be closed with stitches.\nGenetic tests\nTests may also be carried out on your blood and bone marrow samples to check for any unusual genes in the cancerous cells.\nIdentifying unusual genes in these cells can help your doctors decide how soon you should start treatment and which treatment is best for you.\nSome\u00a0treatments for CLL don't work as well in people with certain abnormal genes in the affected cells.\n\n\nTreatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) largely depends on what stage the condition is at when it's diagnosed.\nYou may just need to be monitored at first\u00a0if it's caught early on. Chemotherapy is the main treatment if it's more advanced.\nTreatment can often help keep CLL under control for many\u00a0years.\nIt\u00a0may go away after treatment initially (known as remission), but will usually come back (relapse) a few months or years later and may need to be treated again.\nStages of CLL\nDoctors use stages to describe how far CLL has developed and help them determine when it needs to be treated.\nThere are 3 main stages of CLL:\n\nstage A \u2013\u00a0you have enlarged lymph\u00a0glands in fewer than 3 areas (such as your neck, armpit or groin) and a high white blood cell count\nstage B \u2013\u00a0you have enlarged lymph glands in 3 or more areas and a high white blood cell count\nstage C \u2013\u00a0you have enlarged lymph\u00a0glands or an enlarged spleen, a high white blood cell count, and a low red blood cell or platelet count\n\nStage B and C CLL are usually treated straight away. Stage A generally only needs to be treated if it's getting worse quickly or starting to cause symptoms.\nMonitoring early-stage CLL\nTreatment may not be needed if you don't have any symptoms when you're diagnosed with CLL.\nThis is because:\n\nCLL\u00a0often develops very slowly and may not cause symptoms for\u00a0many years\nthere's no benefit in starting treatment early\ntreatment can cause significant side effects\n\nIn these cases, you will normally just need regular visits to your doctor and\u00a0blood tests\u00a0to monitor the condition.\nTreatment with chemotherapy will usually only be recommended if you develop symptoms, or tests show that the condition is getting worse.\nChemotherapy for more advanced CLL\nMany people with CLL will eventually need to have chemotherapy. This involves taking medication to keep the cancer under control.\nThere are a number of different medicines for CLL, but most people will take 3 main medications in treatment cycles lasting 28 days.\nThese medicines are:\n\nfludarabine \u2013\u00a0usually taken as a tablet\u00a0for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle\ncyclophosphamide \u2013 also\u00a0usually taken as a tablet\u00a0for 3 to 5 days at the start of each treatment cycle\nrituximab \u2013 given\u00a0into a vein over the course of\u00a0a few hours (intravenous infusion) at the\u00a0start of each treatment cycle\n\nFludarabine and cyclophosphamide can usually be taken at home. Rituximab is given in hospital, and sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight.\nA number of different medicines can also be tried if you can't have these medicines, you've tried them but they didn't work, or your CLL has come back after treatment.\nThese include bendamustine, chlorambucil, ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab and prednisolone (a steroid medication).\nThe medicines used to treat CLL can cause some significant side effects, including:\n\npersistent tiredness\nfeeling sick\nan increased risk of infections\neasy bruising or bleeding\nanaemia\u00a0\u2013 shortness of breath, weakness and pale skin\nhair loss\u00a0or thinning\nan irregular heartbeat\nan\u00a0allergic reaction\n\nMost side effects will pass once treatment stops. Let your care team know if you experience any side effects, as\u00a0there are some treatments that can help.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nStem cell or bone marrow transplants\nStem cell or bone marrow transplants\u00a0are sometimes used to try to\u00a0get rid of CLL completely, or control it for longer periods.\nStem cells\u00a0are cells produced by the spongy material found in the centre of some bones (bone marrow) that can turn into different types of blood cells, including white blood cells.\nA stem cell transplant involves:\n\nhaving high-dose chemotherapy and\u00a0radiotherapy to destroy\u00a0the cancerous cells in your body\nremoving stem cells from the blood or bone marrow\u00a0of a donor\u00a0\u2013 this will ideally be someone closely related to you, such as a sibling\ntransplanting the donor stem cells directly into one of your veins\n\nThis\u00a0is the only potential cure for CLL,\u00a0but it's not done very often\u00a0as it's an intensive treatment and many people with CLL are older and not well enough for the benefits to outweigh the risks.\nThe initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy\u00a0can place a significant strain on your body and cause\u00a0troublesome side effects.\nThere's also a risk of serious problems after the transplant, such as graft versus host disease. This is where\u00a0the transplanted cells attack the other cells in your body.\nOther treatments for CLL\nThere are also a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to help treat some of the problems caused by CLL, particularly if you can't have chemotherapy or it doesn't work.\nThese include:\n\nradiotherapy\u00a0to\u00a0shrink enlarged lymph glands or a swollen spleen\nsurgery to remove a swollen spleen\nantibiotics,\u00a0antifungals and antiviral medications to help reduce your risk of picking up an infection during treatment\nblood transfusions\u00a0to provide more red blood cells and\u00a0platelets (clotting\u00a0cells)\u00a0if you experience severe anaemia or problems with bleeding and bruising\nimmunoglobulin replacement therapy\u00a0\u2013 a transfusion of\u00a0antibodies taken from donated blood that\u00a0can help prevent infections\ninjections of medication called\u00a0granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to help boost the number of white blood cells\n\nYou may also need additional treatment for any complications of CLL that develop.\nDeciding against treatment\nAs many of the treatments for CLL can have unpleasant side effects that may affect your quality of life, you may decide against having a particular type of treatment.\nThis is entirely your decision and your treatment team will respect any decision you make.\nYou won't be rushed into deciding about your treatment, and before making a decision you can talk to your doctor, partner, family and friends.\nPain relief and nursing care will still be available as and when you need it.\n\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) can sometimes cause a number of further complications.\nInfections\nPeople with CLL usually have a weakened immune system and are more vulnerable to infections\u00a0because they have a lack of healthy, infection-fighting white blood cells.\nTreatment with\u00a0chemotherapy can also further weaken the immune system.\nIf you have CLL, it's a good idea to:\n\nreport any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately \u2013 things to look out for include a high temperature (fever), aching muscles,\u00a0diarrhoea or headaches\nensure your vaccinations are up-to-date \u2013\u00a0speak to your GP or care team for advice about any additional vaccines you might need, as some aren't safe if you have a weak immune system\navoid close contact with anyone who has an infection \u2013 even if it's an infection to which you were previously immune, such as chickenpox\n\nYou may also be prescribed regular doses of medications such as antibiotics\u00a0to help reduce the risk of infection.\nRichter's syndrome\nIn up to\u00a01 in every 20 people with\u00a0CLL, the condition will change to become very similar to an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is called Richter's transformation or Richter's syndrome.\nSymptoms of Richter's syndrome include:\n\nsudden swelling of your lymph glands\na high temperature (fever)\nnight sweats\nunintentional weight loss\ntummy (abdominal) pain\n\nRichter syndrome is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and other powerful medicines.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information on Richter's syndrome.\nAutoimmune haemolytic anaemia\nAround\u00a01 in every 10 people with CLL will develop a condition called autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.\nThis is where the\u00a0immune system\u00a0starts to attack and destroy red blood cells. It can cause severe anaemia, making you feel breathless and easily tired.\nIt's usually treated with steroid medication\nPsychological effects\nBeing diagnosed with CLL can be very distressing and difficult to take in at first, particularly as it can't necessarily be cured and you may be advised to wait for it to get worse before starting treatment.\nHaving to wait years to see how the condition develops can also be very stressful and make you feel anxious or\u00a0depressed. Speak to your GP or care team if you're finding it difficult to cope.\nYou may also find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or care team will\u00a0be able to provide you with the details of support groups in your area.\nMacmillan Cancer Support\u00a0provides an excellent level of help and support. Their helpline number is\u00a00808 808 00 00, Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm.\n\n\nIt's not known what causes most cases of leukaemia. However, there are many risk factors that are known to increase your chances of getting chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nRisk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia include:\n\nhaving a family history of the condition\nbeing of European, American or Australian origin\nhaving certain medical conditions\nbeing male\u00a0\n\nFamily history\nIn some cases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia appears to run in families. It's thought that an inherited\u00a0gene mutation (change to a gene) could increase your susceptibility to developing the condition. This means there may be certain genes in your family that make it more likely that you'll develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nMore research is needed, but having a parent or sibling (brother or sister) with\u00a0chronic lymphocytic leukaemia slightly\u00a0increases your chances of also developing the condition.\nEthnicity\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia most commonly affects people of European, American and Australian origin.\nIt's rare in people from China, Japan and South East Asia, and it affects more white people than black people. It's not known why the condition affects people of some ethnic backgrounds and not others.\nOther medical conditions\nResearch has shown that having certain medical conditions slightly increases your chances of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These conditions include:\n\npneumonia (chest infection)\u00a0\nsinusitis\u00a0\nshingles\u00a0\nautoimmune haemolytic anaemia\nlong-term (chronic)\u00a0osteoarthritis\nprostatitis (an inflamed prostate)\n\nHowever, rather than causing\u00a0chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of these conditions may occur as a result of\u00a0having lowered immunity during the early stages of the condition.\nHaving a lowered immunity due to having a condition such as HIV or AIDS, or taking immunity lowering medication following an organ transplant can also increase your risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nRadiation exposure\nExposure to\u00a0radiation is known to increase the risk of getting other types of leukaemia, but\u00a0it's not been linked specifically to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\nFor reasons that are unclear, men are around twice as likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia than women. The risk of developing leukaemia also increases as you get older.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. Chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer. There are 2 main types:\n\nlymphocytes \u2013 mostly used to fight viral infections\nmyeloid cells \u2013 which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\n\nThese pages focus on chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is a cancer of the myeloid cells. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere:\n\nchronic lymphocytic leukaemia\nacute myeloid leukaemia\nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia\n\nWhat happens in chronic leukaemia\nYour bone marrow produces stem cells. These are unique cells because they have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cell:\n\nred blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen around the body\nwhite blood cells \u2013 which help fight infection\nplatelets \u2013 which help stop bleeding\n\nIn leukaemia, a genetic mutation in the stem cells causes a huge over-production of white blood cells and a corresponding drop in red blood cells and platelets.\nIt's this lack of red blood cells which causes symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and the lack of platelets that increases the risk of excessive bleeding.\nWarning signs of chronic myeloid leukaemia\nIn its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms. As the condition develops, symptoms include:\n\ntiredness\u00a0\nweight loss\u00a0\nnight sweats\na feeling of bloating\nbruising\u00a0\nbone pain\u00a0\n\nRead more about the symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia\nHow common is chronic myeloid leukaemia?\nChronic myeloid leukaemia is quite a rare type of cancer.\u00a0\nChronic myeloid leukaemia can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people aged 40 to 60. There is no evidence that it runs in families.\n\n\nIn its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms and it is often diagnosed during tests for a different condition.\nWhen symptoms do develop, they are similar to those of many other illnesses and can include:\n\ntiredness\nfrequent infections\nunexplained weight loss\na feeling of bloating\nless commonly, swollen lymph nodes \u2013 glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painless\n\nChronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). This can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. A swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion.\nThe symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia in its advanced stage will be much more noticeable and troublesome. They include:\n\nsevere fatigue\nbone pain\nnight sweats\nfever\neasily bruised skin\n\n\n\nChronic myeloid leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells which produce white blood cells.\nThe change in the DNA causes the\u00a0stem cells to\u00a0produce more white blood cells than are needed.\nThey are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature\u00a0and able to fight infection like healthy 'adult' white blood cells.\nAs the number of immature cells increases,\u00a0the number of\u00a0healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it's this\u00a0fall\u00a0which causes many of the\u00a0symptoms of chronic leukaemia.\nPhiladelphia chromosome\nAlthough the cause of chronic myeloid leukaemia is genetic, it is not inherited as it is an acquired genetic abnormality.\nMost people with the condition have an abnormal chromosome, where a section of DNA from one chromosome\u00a0has been swapped with a section from another.\nThis is called the\u00a0Philadelphia chromosome and it makes the cell produce a protein that encourages the leukaemic cells to resist normal cell death and\u00a0grow and multiply far more quickly than usual.\nPossible triggers for chronic leukaemia\nWhat triggers the development of chronic leukaemia and causes the initial mutation in stem cells is unknown. The one proven risk factor is exposure to radiation.\nHowever, radiation is only a significant risk if the levels are extremely high, such as those recorded after an atomic bomb explodes, or those released after a nuclear reactor accident, such as the one at Chernobyl.\nThere is limited evidence that prolonged exposure to the chemical benzene leads to an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry, but in the UK\u00a0there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure.\nBenzene is also found in cigarettes. However, it is thought that smoking is more of a risk factor in acute leukaemia than it is in chronic leukaemia.\nA number of occupations have been linked to an increased risk of chronic leukaemia, possibly due to exposure to certain substances such as pesticides or chemicals.\nThese occupations include:\n\nall types of agricultural workers\npeople who are involved with rubber or plastic manufacture\ntailors and dressmakers\ncleaners\nbuilder\u2019s labourer\n\nThere is some evidence to show an increased risk of chronic leukaemia in people who:\n\nare obese\nhave a weakened immune system \u2013 due to HIV or AIDS or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant\nhave inflammatory bowel disease \u2013 such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease\n\n\n\nChronic myeloid leukaemia is often first detected when a routine blood test is carried out to diagnose another, unrelated, condition.\nA\u00a0blood test\u00a0that reveals abnormally high levels of white blood cells could be a sign of chronic leukaemia. If you have a blood test with abnormal results, you will be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further testing.\nBone marrow biopsy\nTo confirm a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. This procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy. A bone marrow biopsy is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic.\nThe haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a needle to remove the bone marrow sample.\u00a0You\u00a0may experience some pain\u00a0once the anaesthetic wears off and\u00a0some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you should not have to stay in hospital overnight.\nThe bone marrow sample will be checked to see if there are cancerous cells. If\u00a0there are, the biopsy will also be able to help determine which type of chronic leukaemia is present.\nFurther tests\nThere are a number of additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. These can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated.\u00a0\nCytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. There are a number of specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment.\nFor example, 90% of people with chronic myeloid leukaemia have the Philadelphia chromosome. People who have this\u00a0chromosome are known to respond well to a medicine called imatinib.\nA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test\u00a0can be\u00a0done on a blood sample. This is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment.\nThe blood test is repeated every 3 months for at least 2 years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved.\nIn some cases, the hospital may want to perform some imaging tests to help rule out other conditions or confirm a diagnosis. This may be either:\n\nan\u00a0X-ray\u00a0\u2013 usually to examine your chest\nan\u00a0ultrasound scan\u00a0\u2013 usually to examine your spleen and liver\n\n\n\nImatinib tablets are usually given as soon as you have been diagnosed with\u00a0chronic myeloid leukaemia, to slow its progression. These tablets are taken every day for life, and most patients do really well on them.\nThe aim of treatment is to achieve the following:\n\nby 3 months, correct the blood count\nby 12 months, clear the bone marrow of cells containing the Philadelphia chromosome (see\u00a0Causes page for information on this)\nby 18 months, get to a stage where\u00a0the leukaemia can only be detected by a very sensitive molecular test (molecular remission)\n\nChemotherapy\u00a0is usually offered if the cancer reaches an advanced stage.\nTreating early-stage chronic myeloid leukaemia\nA medicine called imatinib is the main treatment recommended for chronic myeloid leukaemia. It is usually given as soon as a diagnosis is made because the medicine is designed to slow the progression of the cancer and to\u00a0prevent the condition reaching the accelerated or advanced phase.\nImatinib is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This means it blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase\u00a0(tyrosine kinase\u00a0helps to stimulate the growth of cancer cells). This reduces the production of abnormal white blood cells.\nImatinib is taken as a tablet. The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve with time. They include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\nswelling in the face and lower legs\nmuscle cramps\nrash\ndiarrhoea\n\nIt is estimated that 10\u00a0to 40% of people who take imatinib become resistant to its effects, so an alternative treatment is required.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended nilotinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia that is resistant or intolerant to imatinib. In some cases, nilotinib is recommended\u00a0as the first treatment.\nNilotinib\u00a0works in a similar way to imatinib in that it blocks the effects of proteins that help stimulate the growth of cancer cells.\nSide effects of nilotinib can include:\n\nvomiting\nabdominal pain\nbone and joint pain\ndry skin\nloss of appetite\nhair loss\ninsomnia\nnight sweats\ndizziness\ntingling or numbness\n\nIf the\u00a0side effects become particularly troublesome, temporarily stopping the treatment usually helps to bring them under control. Treatment can then be resumed, possibly using a lower dose of medication.\nRead about the complications of chronic myeloid leukaemia for more information and advice about being vulnerable to infection and bleeding.\nTreating advanced chronic myeloid leukaemia\nOnce chronic myeloid leukaemia has progressed to\u00a0a more advanced stage, chemotherapy is the next treatment.\nChemotherapy tablets are usually used first because they have fewer and milder side effects than chemotherapy injections. Side effects include:\n\ntiredness\nskin rash\nincreased vulnerability to infection\n\nChemotherapy can weaken your immune system, which helps protect you against infection. This is known as being immunocompromised. Read\u00a0chronic leukaemia complications\u00a0for more information about this.\nIf your symptoms persist or get worse, chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy) will need to be used. Intravenous chemotherapy causes more side effects than chemotherapy tablets and they tend to be more severe.\nSide effects include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\ntiredness\nhair loss\ninfertility\n\nThese side effects should resolve after your treatment has finished, although there is a risk that infertility could be permanent.\nA bone marrow transplant can offer a cure for\u00a0chronic leukaemia, although it is only suitable and necessary\u00a0for\u00a0some patients.\nBefore transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant has to have aggressive, high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body.\nThis can put enormous strain on the body and can cause significant side effects and potential complications. Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person who is receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type.\nDue to these issues, transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people in good health, and there is a suitable brother or sister who can provide a donation.\nIn most cases of chronic leukaemia, the potential risks of transplantation far outweigh any benefit.\u00a0\nHowever, your specific circumstances may mean that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.\nRead more about bone marrow transplants\n\n\nBeing immunocompromised (having a weakened immune system) is a possible complication for some patients with chronic leukaemia.\nThere are 2 reasons for this:\n\nthe lack of healthy white blood cells means your immune system is less able to fight infection\nmany of the medicines used to treat chronic leukaemia\u00a0can weaken the immune system\n\nThis means you are more vulnerable to developing an infection, and that any infection you have has an increased potential to cause serious complications.\nYou may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections from occurring. You should immediately report any possible symptoms of an infection to your GP or\u00a0care team\u00a0because prompt treatment may be required to prevent serious complications.\nSymptoms of infection include:\n\nhigh temperature (fever) of 38C (101.4F) or above\nheadache\naching muscles\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\n\nAvoid contact with anyone who is known to have an infection, even if it is a type of infection that you were previously immune to, such as chickenpox or measles. This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).\nWhile it is important to go outside on a regular basis, both for exercise and for your psychological wellbeing, avoid visiting crowded places and using public transport during rush hour.\nAlso ensure that all of your\u00a0vaccinations are up-to-date. Your GP or care team will be able to advise you about this. You will be unable to have any vaccine that contains activated particles of viruses or bacteria, such as:\n\nthe\u00a0mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine\nthe polio vaccine\nthe oral typhoid vaccine\nthe BCG vaccine (used to vaccinate against tuberculosis)\nthe yellow fever vaccine\n\nPsychological effects of chronic leukaemia\nReceiving a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia can be very distressing, particularly if it is unlikely that your condition can be cured. At first, the news may be difficult to take in.\nThe situation can be made worse if you are confronted with the knowledge that even though your leukaemia may not currently be causing any symptoms, it could be a serious problem in later life. Having to wait many years to see how the leukaemia develops can be immensely stressful and can trigger feelings of stress, anxiety and depression.\nIf you have been diagnosed with leukaemia, talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist (a doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) may help you to combat feelings of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants or medicines that help to reduce feelings of anxiety may also help you cope better with the condition.\nYou may find it useful to talk to other people who are living with leukaemia. Your GP or multidisciplinary team may be able to provide you with details of local support groups.\nAnother excellent resource is Macmillan Cancer Support. Their helpline number is\u00a00808 808 00 00 and is open Monday to Friday, 9am-8pm.\u00a0\u00a0\nFurther information\nYou can read more information from Cancer Research UK about\u00a0coping with chronic myeloid leukaemia.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease.\nPeople with COPD\u00a0have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction.\nTypical symptoms of COPD include:\n\nincreasing breathlessness when active\na persistent cough with phlegm\nfrequent chest infections\n\nRead more about the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nWhy does COPD happen?\nThe main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring.\nOver many years, the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. The walls of the airways thicken and more mucus is produced. Damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity. The smaller airways also become scarred and narrowed.\u00a0These changes cause the symptoms of breathlessness, cough and phlegm associated with COPD.\nSome cases of COPD are caused by fumes, dust, air pollution and genetic disorders, but these are rarer.\nRead more about the causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nWho is affected?\nCOPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK. It usually only starts to affect people over the age of\u00a035, although most people are not diagnosed until they are in their 50s.\nIt is thought there are more than 3 million people living with the disease in the UK, of which only about 900,000 have been diagnosed. This is because many people who develop symptoms of COPD do not\u00a0get medical help because they often dismiss their symptoms as a \u2018smoker\u2019s cough\u2019.\nCOPD affects more men than women, although\u00a0rates in women\u00a0are increasing.\nDiagnosis\nIt is important that COPD is diagnosed as early as possible so\u00a0treatment can be used to try to slow down the deterioration of your lungs. You should see your GP if you have any of the symptoms of COPD.\nCOPD is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your doctor, which may be followed by breathing tests.\nRead more about diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nTreating\u00a0COPD\nAlthough the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed, you can slow down the progression of the disease. Stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this.\nTreatments for COPD usually involve relieving the symptoms with medication, for example by using an inhaler to make breathing easier. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also help increase the amount of\u00a0exercise you are capable of doing.\nSurgery is only an option for a small number of people with COPD.\nRead more about treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nLiving with COPD\nCOPD can affect your life in many ways, but help is available to reduce its impact.\nSimple steps such as living in a healthy way, being as active as possible,\u00a0learning breathing techniques, and taking your medication can help you to reduce the symptoms of COPD.\nFinancial support and advice about relationships and end of life care\u00a0is also available for people with COPD.\nRead more about living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nCan COPD be prevented?\nAlthough COPD causes about 25,000 deaths a year in the UK, severe COPD can usually\u00a0be prevented by making changes to your lifestyle.\nIf you smoke, stopping is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of getting the condition.\nResearch has shown you are up to four times more likely to succeed in giving up smoking if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this, phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84\u00a0or\u00a0read more about stopping smoking.\nAlso avoid exposure to tobacco smoke as much as possible.\n\n\nSymptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) usually develop over a number of years, so you may not be aware you have the condition.\nCOPD does not usually become noticeable until after the age of 35 and most people diagnosed with the condition are over 50 years old.\nSee your GP if you have the following symptoms:\n\nincreasing\u00a0breathlessness when exercising or moving around\na persistent cough with phlegm that never seems to go away\nfrequent\u00a0chest infections, particularly in winter\nwheezing\n\nMiddle-aged smokers and ex-smokers who have a persistent chesty cough (especially in the morning), breathlessness on slight exertion or persistent coughs and colds in the winter should see their GP or practice nurse for a simple breathing test.\nIf you have COPD, the airways of the lungs become inflamed and narrowed. As the air sacs get permanently damaged, it will become increasingly difficult to breathe out.\nWhile there is currently no cure for COPD, the sooner the condition is diagnosed and appropriate treatment begins, the less chance there is of severe lung damage.\nRead more about treating COPD.\nFlare-ups\nSymptoms of COPD are often worse in\u00a0winter, and it is common to have two or more flare-ups a year. A flare-up (also known as an exacerbation) is when your symptoms are particularly bad.\u00a0This is one of the most common reasons for people being admitted to hospital in the UK.\nIf you're experiencing a flare-up that is worse than normal day to day, you should visit your GP or call NHS 24 on 111.\nOther signs of COPD\nOther signs of COPD can include:\n\nweight loss\ntiredness and fatigue\nswollen ankles\n\nChest pain\u00a0and\u00a0coughing up blood (haemoptysis) are not common symptoms of COPD. They are usually caused by other conditions such as a\u00a0chest infection or, less commonly, lung cancer.\n\n\nThere are several things that may increase your risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), many of which can be avoided.\nThings you can change\nYou can reduce your risk of developing COPD by\u00a0not smoking and avoiding\u00a0exposure to certain substances at work.\nSmoking is the\u00a0main cause of COPD and is thought to\u00a0be responsible for\u00a0around 90% of cases. The lining of the airways becomes inflamed and permanently damaged by smoking and this damage cannot be reversed.\nUp to 25% of smokers develop COPD.\nExposure to other people\u2019s smoke increases the risk of COPD.\nExposure to certain types of dust and chemicals at work, including grains, isocyanates, cadmium and coal, has been linked to the development of COPD, even in people who do not smoke.\u00a0\nThe risk of COPD is even higher if you breathe in dust or fumes in the workplace and you smoke.\nAccording to some research, air pollution may be an additional risk factor for COPD. However, at the moment it is not\u00a0conclusive and research is continuing.\nRead further information:\n\nstopping smoking\ntreatments to help you stop smoking\nHealth and Safety Executive: COPD\n\nThings you cannot change\nThere are a few factors for COPD\u00a0that you cannot change.\nA research study has shown that smokers who have brothers and sisters with severe COPD are at greater risk of developing the condition than smokers who do not.\nThere is a rare genetic tendency to develop COPD called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. This causes COPD in a small number of people (about 1%). Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protein that protects your lungs. Without it, the lungs can be damaged by other enzymes that occur naturally in the body.\nPeople who have an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency usually develop COPD at a younger age, often under 35.\nRead further information:\n\nBritish Lung Foundation: Alpha-1-antitrypsin\nAlpha1 Awareness UK\n\n\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, as well as breathing tests.\nIf you are concerned about the health of your lungs and have symptoms that could be COPD, see your GP as soon as you can.\nBeing diagnosed early means you will receive appropriate treatment, advice and help to stop or slow the progression of COPD.\nAt a consultation, your doctor will ask\u00a0about your symptoms, how long you have had them, and whether you smoke, or used to smoke. They will examine you and listen to your chest using a stethoscope. You may also be weighed and measured to calculate your body mass index (BMI).\nYour doctor will also check how well your lungs are working with a lung function test called spirometery.\nSpirometry\nTo assess how well your lungs work, a breathing test called\u00a0spirometry is carried out. You will be asked to breathe into a machine called a spirometer.\nThe spirometer takes two measurements: the volume of air you can breathe out in one second (called the forced expiratory volume in one second or FEV1) and the total amount of air you breathe out (called the forced vital capacity or FVC).\nYou may be asked to breathe out a few times to get a consistent reading.\nThe readings are compared with normal measurements for your age, which can show if your airways are obstructed.\nOther tests\nYou\u00a0may have other tests as well as spirometry. Often, these other tests will help the doctor rule out other conditions\u00a0that cause similar symptoms.\nA chest\u00a0X-ray\u00a0will show whether you have another lung condition\u00a0which may be causing symptoms, such as a\u00a0chest infection or\u00a0lung cancer.\nA\u00a0blood test will show whether your symptoms could be due to anaemia, as this can also cause breathlessness.\nFurther tests\nSome people may need more tests. The tests may confirm the diagnosis or indicate the severity of your COPD. This will help you and your doctor plan your treatment.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram may be used to check the condition of your heart.\nAn ECG involves attaching electrodes (sticky metal patches) to your arms, legs and chest to pick up the electrical signals from your heart.\nAn echocardiogram uses sound waves to build a detailed picture of your heart. This is similar to an ultrasound scan.\nTo confirm\u00a0you have\u00a0COPD and not asthma, you may be\u00a0asked to take regular measurements of your breathing using a peak flow meter, at different times over several days. The peak flow meter measures how fast you can breathe out.\nThe level of oxygen in your blood is measured using a pulse oximeter, which looks like a peg and is\u00a0attached to the finger. If you have low levels of oxygen, you may need an assessment to see whether extra oxygen would help you.\nIf the condition runs in your family or you developed the symptoms of COPD under the age of\u00a035 and have never smoked, you will probably have a blood test to see if you are alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient.\nSome people may need a CT scan. This provides more information than an X-ray and can be useful in diagnosing other lung diseases or assessing changes to your lungs due to COPD.\nIf your symptoms seem worse than would be expected from your spirometry results, your doctor may decide you need more detailed lung function tests. You may be referred to a hospital specialist for these tests.\nThe doctor may take a sample of phlegm (sputum) to check whether it has been infected.\n\n\nStop smoking\nStopping smoking\u00a0is the\u00a0most effective\u00a0way for people with COPD to help themselves feel better and is the only proven way to reduce the rate of decline in lung function.\nStopping smoking at an early stage of the disease makes a huge difference. Any damage already done to the airways cannot be reversed, but giving up smoking can slow the rate at which the condition worsens.\nIf COPD is in the early stages and symptoms are mild, no other treatments may be needed. However, it is never too late to stop smoking. Even people with fairly advanced COPD are likely to benefit from quitting, which may prevent further damage to the airways.\nResearch has shown\u00a0you are up to four times more likely to give up smoking successfully if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as tablets, patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this.\nRead more about stopping smoking.\nInhalers\nIf an inhaler is prescribed for you, your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist can explain how to use it. They will check you are using it properly.\nMost people learn to use an inhaler successfully, but if you are having problems, a spacer or a\u00a0different type of inhaler device may help you take your medicines correctly. A spacer is a device that increases the amount of medication that reaches the lungs.\nShort-acting bronchodilator inhalers\nShort-acting bronchodilator inhalers deliver a small dose of medicine directly to your lungs, causing the muscles in your airways to relax and open up.\nThere are two types of short-acting bronchodilator inhaler:\n\nbeta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salbutamol and terbutaline\nantimuscarinic inhalers, such as ipratropium\n\nThe inhaler should be used when you feel breathless and this should relieve the symptoms.\nLong-acting bronchodilator inhalers\nIf a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler does not help relieve your symptoms, your GP may recommend a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler. This works in a similar way to a short-acting bronchodilator, but each dose lasts for at least 12 hours.\nThere are two types of long-acting bronchodilator inhalers:\n\nbeta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol\u00a0\nantimuscarinic inhalers, such as tiotropium, glycopyronium and aclidinium\n\nSteroid inhalers\nSteroid inhalers, also called corticosteroid inhalers, work by reducing the inflammation in your airways.\nIf you are still getting breathless or having flare-ups even when taking long-acting bronchodilator inhalers, your GP may suggest including a steroid inhaler as part of your treatment. Most people with COPD will be prescribed a steroid inhaler as part of a combination inhaler.\nMedicines\nIf you are getting breathless or having flare-ups when using a combination of inhalers, your GP may prescribe theophylline tablets. Theophylline causes the muscles of your airways to relax and open up.\nWhen you have been taking theophylline tablets regularly, you\u00a0may need to give a blood sample to measure the amount of theophylline in your blood and help your GP prescribe the appropriate dose of tablet. This will allow you to get the correct dose of theophylline while reducing the likelihood of side effects.\nDue to the risk of potential side effects, such as increased heart rate and headaches, other medicines, such as a bronchodilator inhaler, are usually tried before theophylline.\nMucolytics, such as carbocisteine, make the mucus and phlegm in your throat thinner and easier to cough up. They are particularly beneficial for people with a persistent cough with lots of thick phlegm or who have frequent or bad flare-ups.\nIf you have a chest infection, your GP may prescribe a short course of antibiotics.\nSteroid tablets may also be prescribed as a short course if you have a bad flare-up. They work best if they are taken as the flare-up starts, so your GP may give you a course to keep at home. Occasionally, you may have to take a longer course of steroid tablets. Your GP will give you the lowest effective dose and monitor you for side effects. Side effects are uncommon if steroid tablets are given for less than three weeks.\nRead more about the medicines used in\u00a0the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medicines guide.\nOther types of treatment\nNebulised medication\u00a0can be used for severe cases of COPD if other inhaler devices have not worked effectively. A compressor is a machine that administers nebulised medicine through a mouthpiece or a face mask. The medicine is in a liquid form and is converted into a fine mist. This enables a large dose of medicine to be taken in one go.\nYou can usually choose whether to use nebulised medication\u00a0with a mouthpiece or a facemask. Your GP will advise you on\u00a0how to use the machine correctly.\nIf the oxygen level in your blood is low, you may\u00a0be advised to have oxygen at home through nasal tubes, also called a nasal cannula, or through a mask. Oxygen is not a treatment for breathlessness, but it is helpful for some patients with persistently low oxygen levels in the blood.\nYou will probably be referred for more detailed assessment to see whether you might benefit from long-term oxygen therapy.\nIf you are prescribed long term oxygen therapy, it must be taken for at least 15 hours a day to be effective. However, the longer you use it, the more effective it is.\nThe tubes from the machine are long so you will be able to move around your home while you are connected. Portable oxygen tanks are available if you need to use oxygen away from home.\nThe aim of long-term oxygen therapy is to extend your life.\nDo not smoke when you are using oxygen. The increased level of oxygen\u00a0produced is highly flammable, and a lit cigarette could trigger a fire or explosion.\nPart of the oxygen assessment is likely to consider if you may benefit from ambulatory oxygen \u2013 oxygen used when you walk or are active in other ways.\nIf your oxygen levels are normal while you are resting, but fall when you exercise, you may not need long-term oxygen therapy alongside ambulatory oxygen therapy.\nRead more about\u00a0home oxygen treatment.\nNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) helps a person breathe using a portable machine connected to a mask covering the nose or face. You may receive it if you are taken to hospital because of a flare-up. You may be referred to a specialist centre to see if\u00a0home NIV could help you.\u00a0NIV is used to improve the functioning of your lungs.\nPulmonary rehabilitation is a programme of exercise and education designed to help people with chronic lung problems. It can increase your exercise capacity, mobility and self-confidence.\nPulmonary rehabilitation is based on a programme of physical exercise training tailored to your needs. It usually\u00a0involves walking or cycling, and\u00a0arm and strength-building exercises. It also includes education about\u00a0your disease for\u00a0you and\u00a0your family, dietary assessment and advice, and psychological, social and behavioural changes designed to help\u00a0you cope better.\nA rehabilitation programme is provided by a multidisciplinary team, which\u00a0includes physiotherapists, respiratory nurse specialists and dietitians.\nPulmonary rehabilitation takes place in a group and the course usually lasts for about six weeks. During the course, you will learn more about your COPD and how to control your symptoms.\nPulmonary rehabilitation can greatly improve your quality of life.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Chronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas (a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage) becomes permanently damaged from inflammation.\nIt's different to\u00a0acute pancreatitis, where the inflammation is only short-term.\nThe most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal\u00a0(tummy) pain, which can be severe.\nOther symptoms tend to develop as the damage to the pancreas progresses, such as producing greasy, foul-smelling stools.\nRead more about the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and diagnosing chronic pancreatitis.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nAlways visit your GP if you're experiencing severe pain \u2013 it's a warning sign that something is wrong.\nWhy it happens\nLong-term alcohol misuse is responsible for around 7 out of every 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. This is because heavy drinking over a number of years can repeatedly damage the pancreas.\nLess common causes include:\n\nsmoking\na problem with the immune system, causing it to attack the pancreas\nan inherited\u00a0genetic mutation disrupting the functions of the pancreas\n\nIn\u00a0as many as\u00a03 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause cannot be identified\u00a0\u2013 this is known as \"idiopathic\" chronic pancreatitis.\nRead more about the causes of chronic pancreatitis.\nWho's affected\nChronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age, but is most common in middle-aged men aged between 45 and 54.\nBetween 2012 and 2013, over 35,000 people visited hospitals in England with the condition.\nHow it's treated\nIn most cases of chronic pancreatitis, there's no specific treatment to reduce the inflammation and repair the damage to the pancreas.\nTreatment mainly focuses on lifestyle changes (see below) and medication to relieve the pain. Surgery is sometimes needed to treat severe chronic pain that doesn't respond to painkillers.\nHowever, the pain can be difficult to treat and can seriously affect your quality of life.\nPeople who don't smoke cigarettes and avoid drinking alcohol tend to experience less pain and live longer than those who continue to drink and smoke after receiving a diagnosis.\nRead more about treating chronic pancreatitis.\nComplications\nLiving with chronic pain\u00a0can cause mental as well as physical strain. It's important to speak to your GP if you're experiencing\u00a0stress, anxiety or depression\u00a0caused by chronic pancreatitis.\nDiabetes is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and affects about a third of people with the condition. It occurs when the pancreas is damaged and unable to produce insulin.\nPeople with chronic pancreatitis also have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer.\nRead more about the possible complications of chronic pancreatitis.\n\n\nThe most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain. Eventually, there may also be digestion problems.\nThe pain usually develops in the middle or left side of\u00a0the abdomen and can sometimes travel along your back. It's been described as a burning or shooting pain which comes and goes, but can last for several hours or days, in some cases.\nSome people also experience symptoms of\u00a0nausea and vomiting during the pain. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe.\nAlthough the pain sometimes occurs after eating a meal, there's often no trigger.\nEventually, a constant mild to moderate pain can develop in the abdomen in between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.\nSome people who\u00a0stop\u00a0drinking alcohol and\u00a0stop smoking\u00a0may experience a reduction in the severity of their pain.\nAdvanced chronic pancreatitis\nAdditional symptoms can occur when the pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food in the digestive system. The pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the original symptoms started.\nThe absence of digestive juices\u00a0makes it difficult for your digestive system to break\u00a0down fats and certain proteins. This can cause your stools to become particularly smelly and greasy, and make them difficult to flush down the toilet.\nYou may also experience:\n\nweight loss\nloss of appetite\njaundice\u00a0(yellowing of the skin and eyes)\nsymptoms of diabetes \u2013 such as feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently and feeling very tired\nongoing nausea and vomiting\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nAlways visit your GP if you're experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong.\nYou should also visit your GP if you develop symptoms of jaundice. Jaundice can have a range of causes other than pancreatitis, but it's usually a sign that there's something wrong with your digestive system.\nYou should also visit your GP if you develop persistent vomiting.\n\n\nMost cases of chronic pancreatitis are associated with drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over a long period of time.\nHowever,\u00a0in up to\u00a03 out of 10 people with the condition,\u00a0the cause\u00a0can't be\u00a0identified \u2013 known as \"idiopathic\" chronic pancreatitis.\nSome of the known causes of chronic pancreatitis are outlined below.\nAlcohol consumption\nHeavy drinking over many years can cause repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is usually a short-term condition, but it can recur if you continue to drink alcohol.\nOver time, repeated inflammation causes permanent damage to the pancreas, resulting in chronic pancreatitis.\nAnyone who regularly consumes alcohol has an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis, although only a minority develop the condition.\nRead more about\u00a0alcohol misuse.\nProblems with the immune system\nRare cases of chronic pancreatitis are the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the pancreas. This is known as \"autoimmune pancreatitis\" and it's not clear exactly why it happens.\nMany people with autoimmune pancreatitis also have other conditions caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue. These include ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease, both of which cause inflammation inside the digestive system.\nGenetics\nSome cases of chronic pancreatitis are inherited. This is thought to be caused by mutations (alterations) in a number of genes, including genes called PRSS1 and SPINK-1. These mutations disrupt the\u00a0normal working of the pancreas.\nGenetic mutations may also have a role in the effect of alcohol on your pancreas. Evidence suggests that certain genetic mutations make\u00a0the pancreas more vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol.\nCertain mutations of the CFTR gene, responsible for\u00a0cystic fibrosis,\u00a0are also thought to cause chronic pancreatitis in a small amount of cases.\nOther causes\nSeveral other rare causes of chronic pancreatitis have also been identified, including:\n\ninjury to the pancreas\nblocked\u00a0or narrowed\u00a0openings (ducts)\u00a0of the pancreas\nsmoking\nradiotherapy to the\u00a0abdomen (tummy)\n\n\n\nChronic pancreatitis can usually only be diagnosed by carrying out scans of the pancreas.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a simple physical examination, but they'll refer you for further tests if they suspect chronic pancreatitis.\nThese\u00a0tests are usually carried out\u00a0in\u00a0your local hospital and\u00a0may include:\n\nrequesting a stool sample\nan\u00a0ultrasound scan \u2013 where sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your pancreas\na computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of the pancreas\nan endoscopic ultrasonography\u00a0(see below)\na magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or MRCP (see below)\n\nDuring an endoscopic ultrasonography, a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. An ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the\u00a0endoscope is able to get close to the pancreas and take very accurate pictures of it.\nYou'll usually be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure.\nAn MRCP involves injecting you with a substance known as a contrast agent that\u00a0makes your pancreas and surrounding organs, such as the gallbladder and liver, show up very clearly on a\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.\nAn\u00a0MRI scanner is a type of imaging system that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to build up a detailed image of the inside of your body.\nAn MRCP is a useful way of checking whether gallstones may be contributing to your symptoms.\nBiopsy\nSometimes, the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can be very similar to pancreatic cancer. Therefore, if you have symptoms such as\u00a0jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\u00a0and weight loss, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.\nA\u00a0biopsy involves taking a small sample of cells from the pancreas and sending it to a laboratory, so it can be checked under a microscope for the presence of cancerous cells.\nA biopsy can be taken using a long, thin needle that's passed through your abdomen. The needle can be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound scan or CT scan. Alternatively, a biopsy can be taken during an endoscopic ultrasonography (see above).\n\n\nTreatment for chronic pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and reduce any symptoms.\nLifestyle changes\nIf you're diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, some lifestyle changes will be recommended. These are described below.\nThe most important thing you can do is to stop drinking alcohol, even if\u00a0it isn't the cause of your condition. This helps to\u00a0prevent further damage to your pancreas and may help to reduce the pain.\nIf you continue to drink alcohol, it's likely that you'll experience debilitating pain and you'll be more likely to die from a complication of chronic pancreatitis.\nSome people with chronic pancreatitis caused by alcohol consumption have a dependency on alcohol and require additional help and support to stop drinking. If this applies to you, talk to your GP about getting help to stop drinking.\nTreatment options for alcohol dependence include:\n\none-to-one\u00a0counselling\nself-help groups \u2013 such as Alcoholics Anonymous\na medication called acamprosate that can help to reduce cravings for alcohol\n\nRead more about\u00a0treating alcohol misuse.\nIf you smoke, you should stop. Smoking can speed up the progress of chronic pancreatitis, making it more likely that your pancreas will lose its function.\nIt's recommended that you use an anti-smoking treatment, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion (a medication used to reduce cravings for cigarettes). People who use these types of treatments have a much greater success rate in permanently stopping smoking than those who try to quit using willpower alone.\nIf you want to give up smoking, it's a good idea to start by visiting your GP. They'll be able to\u00a0give you\u00a0help and advice about quitting and can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking support service.\nThese services offer the best support for people who want to give up smoking. Studies show you are 4\u00a0times more likely to give up smoking if you do it through the NHS.\u00a0\nRead more about\u00a0stopping smoking.\nAs chronic pancreatitis\u00a0can affect your ability to digest certain foods, you may need to change your diet.\nYour GP\u00a0may be able to provide you with appropriate dietary advice, or\u00a0may refer you to a dietitian, who will draw up a suitable dietary plan.\nA\u00a0low-fat, high-protein, high-calorie diet with fat-soluble vitamin supplements is usually recommended, but don't make changes to your diet without consulting a health professional.\nEnzyme supplements\nYou may be given\u00a0pancreatic enzyme supplements, which is medication containing an artificial version of the enzymes produced by your pancreas. These supplements\u00a0may help to improve the effectiveness of your digestive system.\nSide effects of\u00a0pancreatic enzyme supplements can include diarrhoea, constipation, nausea, vomiting and stomach pains.\nTalk to your GP if you're experiencing troublesome side effects, as your dosage may need to be adjusted.\nSteroid medication\nIf you have chronic pancreatitis caused by problems with your immune system, treatment is relatively straightforward. The inflammation affecting the pancreas can usually be relieved using steroid medication (corticosteroids).\nHowever, taking corticosteroids for a long time can cause side effects, such as\u00a0osteoporosis and weight gain.\nPain relief\nPain relief is an important part of the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. At first,\u00a0mild\u00a0painkillers will be used, but more powerful ones will be\u00a0needed\u00a0if these don't work.\nIn most cases, the first painkiller used is paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen.\nTaking NSAIDs on a long-term basis can increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers, so you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect against this.\nIf NSAIDs or paracetamol prove to be ineffective in controlling your pain, it's likely that you'll need an opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol. Side effects of these types of medication can include constipation, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness.\nThe side effect of constipation can be particularly troublesome if you need to take an opiate-based painkiller on a long-term basis. You may be prescribed a laxative to help relieve your constipation.\nSee the page on treating constipation for more information.\nIf you feel drowsy after taking an opiate-based painkiller, avoid driving and using heavy tools or machines.\nIf you experience an attack of very severe pain, you may need a stronger opiate-based painkiller, such as morphine or pethidine. These have similar side effects to the opiate-based painkillers mentioned above.\nLong-term use of these stronger opiate-based painkillers isn't usually recommended, because there's a high risk of addiction. Therefore, if you have persistent severe pain, surgery\u00a0is usually recommended.\nIn some cases, an additional medication called amitriptyline may be recommended. Amitriptyline was originally designed to treat depression, but it can help to relieve pain in some people.\nIf medication isn't effective, severe pain can sometimes be temporarily relieved for\u00a0a few weeks or\u00a0months using a procedure called\u00a0a nerve block. This is an injection that blocks the pain signals from the pancreas.\nSevere episodes\nIf the inflammation of your pancreas suddenly gets worse, you may need a short stay in hospital for treatment.\nThis may involve having fluids delivered directly into a vein, and oxygen supplied through tubes into your nose.\nRead more about treating acute pancreatitis.\nSurgery\nSurgery can be used to treat severe pain in people with chronic pancreatitis. Depending on the exact cause of your pain, there are a variety of surgical techniques that may be used. Some of these are outlined below.\nPatients with stones in the opening of their pancreas (the pancreatic duct) may benefit from endoscopic surgery and a treatment called lithotripsy.\nLithotripsy involves using shock waves to break the stone into smaller pieces. An\u00a0endoscope (a long, thin\u00a0flexible tube with a light source and a video camera at one end) is then used to pass surgical instruments into the pancreatic duct so the pieces can be removed.\nThis treatment may improve pain to some extent, but the benefit may not be permanent.\nIn cases where specific parts of the pancreas are inflamed and causing severe pain, these parts can be surgically removed. This type of surgery is called a pancreas resection.\nPancreas resection can also be used if endoscopic treatment is ineffective.\nThe\u00a0technique used\u00a0for pancreas resection depends on exactly which parts need to be removed. For example, some techniques involve removing the gallbladder, along with parts of the pancreas.\nThe different surgical techniques tend to have the same levels of effectiveness in terms of reducing pain and preserving the function of the pancreas, although\u00a0some of the more complex techniques have an increased risk of complications, such as infection and internal bleeding. Simpler procedures have a lower risk of complications and usually have faster recovery times.\nDiscuss the pros and cons of the appropriate pancreas resection techniques with your surgical team before making a decision.\nIn the most serious cases of chronic pancreatitis, where the pancreas has been extensively damaged, it may be necessary to remove the entire pancreas. This is known as a total pancreatectomy.\nA total pancreatectomy can be very effective in treating pain. However, you'll no longer be able to produce the insulin that's needed by your body. To overcome this problem, a relatively new technique called autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation (APICT) is sometimes used.\nDuring APICT,\u00a0the islet cells responsible for producing insulin are removed from your pancreas, before your pancreas is surgically removed.\nThe\u00a0islet cells are mixed with a special solution, which is injected into your liver. If the APICT procedure is successful, the islet cells remain in your liver and begin to produce insulin.\nIn the short term, APICT appears to be effective, but you may need additional insulin treatment in the long term. See guidelines from the\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) about\u00a0autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation for more information.\n\n\nComplications of chronic pancreatitis are relatively common and usually caused by living with chronic pain or damage to the pancreas.\nPsychological effects of chronic pancreatitis\nAny chronic health condition, particularly one causing recurring or constant pain, can have an adverse effect on your emotional and psychological health.\u00a0The International\u00a0Association for the Study of Pain\u00a0found that up to 94% of people with\u00a0chronic pancreatitis experience pain.\nOne study of\u00a0people living with chronic pancreatitis found that one in\u00a0seven people had some sort of psychological or emotional problem, such as stress,\u00a0anxiety or depression.\nContact your GP if you're experiencing psychological and emotional difficulties. Effective treatments are available\u00a0to help improve the symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.\nJoining a support group for people with chronic pancreatitis\u00a0may also help. Talking to other people with the same condition can often help to reduce feelings of isolation and stress.\nDiabetes\nAround a third of people with chronic pancreatitis develop diabetes, usually many years after receiving their diagnosis (it's not unusual for 20 years to pass before diabetes occurs).\nDiabetes develops when your pancreas is no longer able to produce insulin (a chemical the body uses to break glucose down into energy). The main symptoms of diabetes are:\n\nfeeling very thirsty\ngoing to the toilet a lot, particularly at night\nextreme tiredness\nweight loss and muscle wasting (loss of muscle bulk)\n\nIf you develop diabetes because of chronic pancreatitis, you'll probably need to have regular insulin injections to compensate for the lack of natural insulin in your body.\nPseudocysts\nAnother common complication of chronic pancreatitis is pseudocysts (sacs of fluid which develop on the surface of your pancreas). They're thought to affect around\u00a01 in\u00a010\u00a0people with chronic pancreatitis.\nIn many cases, pseudocysts don't cause any symptoms and are only detected during a computerised tomography (CT) scan. However, in some people, pseudocysts can cause the following symptoms:\n\nbloating\nindigestion\ndull abdominal pain\n\nIf the pseudocysts are small and not causing any symptoms, there may be no need for treatment, because they usually disappear on their own.\nTreatment is usually recommended if you're experiencing symptoms or the pseudocysts are larger than 6cm (2.3 inches) in diameter. Larger pseudocysts are at risk of bursting open, which could cause internal bleeding or trigger an infection.\nPseudocysts can be treated by draining the fluid out of the cyst. This can be done by inserting a needle through your skin and into the cyst. Alternatively, an endoscopy\u00a0may be used. This is where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is passed down your throat, and tiny tools are used to drain away the fluid.\nSometimes, pseudocysts are treated by removing part of the pancreas using laparoscopic or \"keyhole\" surgery. This is known as a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. See guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.\nChronic pancreatitis increases your risk of developing\u00a0pancreatic cancer. However, the increased risk is relatively small. For example, it's estimated that for every 100 people with chronic pancreatitis, only 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0will develop pancreatic cancer.\nThe most common initial symptoms of pancreatic cancer are much the same as chronic pancreatitis. They\u00a0include jaundice, abdominal pain and weight loss.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by continuous, long-term liver damage.\nScar tissue replaces\u00a0healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly.\nThe damage caused by cirrhosis can't be reversed and can eventually become so extensive that your liver stops functioning. This is called liver failure.\nCirrhosis can be fatal if the liver fails. However, it usually\u00a0takes\u00a0years for\u00a0the condition\u00a0to reach this stage and treatment can help slow its progression.\nEach year in\u00a0the UK, around 4,000 people die from cirrhosis and 700 people with the condition need a\u00a0liver transplant to survive.\nSigns and symptoms\nThere are usually few symptoms in the early stages of cirrhosis. However, as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you're likely to experience a loss of appetite, nausea and\u00a0itchy skin.\nIn the later stages, symptoms can include jaundice, vomiting blood, dark, tarry-looking stools, and a build-up of fluid in the legs (oedema) and abdomen (ascites).\nRead more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.\nWhen to see your GP\nAs cirrhosis doesn't have many obvious symptoms during the early stages, it's often picked up during tests for an unrelated illness.\nSee your GP if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\nfever and shivering\nshortness of breath\u00a0\nvomiting blood\nvery dark or black, tarry stools (faeces)\nperiods of confusion or drowsiness\n\nRead more about diagnosing cirrhosis.\nWhat causes cirrhosis?\nIn\u00a0the UK, the most common causes of cirrhosis are:\n\ndrinking too much alcohol (alcohol misuse) over many years\nbeing\u00a0infected with the\u00a0hepatitis C virus for a long time\na\u00a0condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that causes excess fat to build up in the liver\n\nNASH is on the rise in the UK, due to increasing levels of\u00a0obesity and reduced physical activity. It's likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis.\nLess common causes of cirrhosis include\u00a0hepatitis B infection and inherited liver diseases, such as haemochromatosis.\nRead more about the causes of cirrhosis.\nTreating cirrhosis\nThere's currently no cure for cirrhosis.\u00a0However, it's possible to manage\u00a0the symptoms\u00a0and any complications, and slow\u00a0its progression.\nTreating underlying conditions that may be the cause, such as using anti-viral medication to treat a hepatitis C infection, can also stop cirrhosis getting worse.\nYou may be advised to cut down or stop drinking alcohol, or to lose weight if you're overweight.\u00a0A wide\u00a0range of alcohol support\u00a0services are available.\nIn its more advanced stages, the scarring caused by cirrhosis can make your liver stop functioning. In this case, a\u00a0liver transplant is the only treatment option.\nRead more about treating cirrhosis.\nPreventing cirrhosis\nNot\u00a0exceeding\u00a0the recommended limits for alcohol consumption\u00a0is the best way of preventing alcohol-related cirrhosis.\n\nmen and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week\nspread your drinking over 3\u00a0days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week\n\nRead more about alcohol units.\nHepatitis B and C are infections you can get by having unprotected sex or sharing needles to inject drugs. Using a condom during sex and not injecting drugs will reduce your risk of developing hepatitis B and C.\nA vaccine for\u00a0hepatitis B is available, but there's currently no vaccine for hepatitis C.\nRead more about preventing cirrhosis.\n\n\nThere are usually few symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis. Noticeable problems tend to develop as the liver becomes more damaged.\nIn\u00a0early stage cirrhosis, the liver is able to function properly despite being damaged. As the condition progresses, symptoms tend to develop when functions of the liver are affected.\nSymptoms of cirrhosis\u00a0can include:\n\ntiredness and weakness\nloss of appetite\nweight loss and muscle wasting\nfeeling sick\u00a0(nausea) and vomiting\ntenderness or pain around the liver area\ntiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin above waist level\nvery itchy skin\nyellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)\na tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums\nhair loss\nfever and shivering attacks\nswelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (oedema)\nswelling in your abdomen (tummy), due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites (severe cases\u00a0can make you look heavily pregnant)\n\nYou may\u00a0also notice changes in your personality, problems sleeping (insomnia), memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating. This is known as encephalopathy and\u00a0occurs when toxins affect your brain because your liver is unable to remove them from your body.\nLate-stage symptoms\nIn the later stages of cirrhosis, you may vomit blood or have tarry, black stools. This is because blood can't flow through the liver properly, which causes an increase in blood pressure in the vein that carries blood from the gut to the liver (portal vein).\nThe increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). These can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools.\nOver time, the toxins that would normally be removed from the body by a healthy liver can cause multiple organ failure, followed by death.\nWhen to\u00a0seek medical help\nYou should see your GP if you have persistent signs and symptoms of cirrhosis.\nSeek immediate medical help if you develop the following symptoms, particularly if you've been previously diagnosed with cirrhosis:\n\nfever and shivering attacks\nshortness of breath\u00a0\nvomiting blood\u00a0\nvery dark or black tarry stools\nperiods of mental confusion or drowsiness\n\n\n\nThere are many different causes of cirrhosis. In the UK, the most common causes are drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and long-term hepatitis C infections.\nIn\u00a0some cases, no specific cause is identified.\nAlcohol consumption\nThe liver breaks down toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, but too much alcohol can scar and damage the liver's cells. Men and women who drink more than 14\u00a0units of alcohol a week are considered to be drinking too much.\nIf you're a heavy drinker, your chances of developing cirrhosis are increased. However, it's important to realise that cirrhosis of the liver isn't just a condition that affects people dependent on alcohol. If you're a heavy social drinker, you can also develop cirrhosis.\nAlcohol-related cirrhosis usually develops after 10 or more years of heavy drinking. For unknown reasons, some people are more susceptible to liver cell damage than others. Women who drink heavily are more susceptible to liver damage than men, partly because of their different body size and build.\nPeople who drink excessively and continue to drink heavily develop cirrhosis in 3\u00a0separate stages. These are described below.\n\nThe first stage of\u00a0alcohol-related liver disease is known as \"fatty liver\", which almost all excessive drinkers develop. It's a side effect of the liver breaking alcohol down and disappears when you drink less.\nThe second stage of alcohol-related liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis. Around 20-30% of people who continue to drink heavily develop alcoholic hepatitis. During this stage, the liver becomes inflamed. If alcoholic hepatitis deteriorates into its most extreme form (liver failure) it can lead to death.\nAbout 10% of heavy drinkers\u00a0develop cirrhosis, which is the third stage of alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThis risk of developing cirrhosis, along with the risk of alcoholic hepatitis, is one of the main reasons the government recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. If you do drink as much as 14 units a week, it is advised that you spread your drinking over three or more days.\u00a0\nA unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units.\u00a0\nRead more about alcohol units.\nYour GP can give you help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink.\u00a0\nHepatitis\nHepatitis\u00a0is\u00a0inflammation\u00a0of the liver. Left untreated, it can damage the liver over many years, eventually resulting in cirrhosis.\nIn\u00a0the UK, hepatitis C\u00a0is\u00a0the most common form of hepatitis. The hepatitis C\u00a0virus\u00a0is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact,\u00a0most commonly by sharing needles used to inject drugs.\nTwo other types of hepatitis infection,\u00a0hepatitis B and D, can also cause cirrhosis.\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe liver condition that can lead to cirrhosis. As with alcohol-related liver disease, the early stage of NASH is the build-up of excess fat in the liver. This fat is associated with inflammation and scarring, which could lead to cirrhosis.\nNASH can develop in people\u00a0who are\u00a0obese, have diabetes, have\u00a0high levels of fat in the blood (high cholesterol) and high blood pressure. Most people with NASH feel well and aren't aware\u00a0they have a problem until cirrhosis occurs and liver function is affected.\nNASH is on the rise in the UK due to increasing levels of\u00a0obesity and reduced physical activity. It's likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis.\nOther causes\nThere are a number of other conditions that can prevent the liver functioning healthily and can lead to cirrhosis. These include:\n\nautoimmune\u00a0liver disease \u2013 the immune system usually makes antibodies to attack bacteria and viruses; however, if you have an autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),\u00a0your immune system will make antibodies that attack healthy organs\nsome rare, genetic conditions \u2013 such as haemochromatosis (a build-up of iron in the liver and other parts of the body) and Wilson's disease (a build-up of copper in the liver and other parts of the body)\nany condition that causes the bile ducts to become blocked \u2013 such as\u00a0cancer of the bile ducts or pancreatic cancer\u00a0\nBudd-Chiari syndrome \u2013 caused by blood clots blocking the veins that carry blood from the liver\n\nLess commonly, the use of certain medications, such as amiodarone and methotrexate, can also cause cirrhosis.\n\n\nIf your GP suspects cirrhosis, they'll check your medical history and carry out a physical examination to look for signs of chronic liver disease.\nIf your GP suspects your liver is damaged, you'll be referred for tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nTests\nYou may have a number of different tests including those described below.\nBlood tests\u00a0can measure your liver function and the amount of liver damage. A blood test may be used to measure the levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST) in your blood, as these will be raised if you have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis).\nAn ultrasound scan,\u00a0transient elastography scan, computerised tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be carried out on your liver. A\u00a0transient elastography scan is similar to an ultrasound scan carried out during pregnancy (it's sometimes known as a Fibroscan).\nThese scans can produce detailed images of your liver or check liver stiffness to identify any scarring.\nThe\u00a0Lab Tests Online UK\u00a0website has\u00a0more information about\u00a0ALT and AST measurements.\nA liver\u00a0biopsy\u00a0is where a\u00a0fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs) to remove\u00a0a small sample of liver cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory so it can be examined under a microscope.\nThe biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic, as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. The outcome of the biopsy will confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis and may provide more information about the cause.\u00a0However, transient elastography is increasingly being used as an alternative to a biopsy in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.\nAn\u00a0endoscopy is where an endoscope (a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end) is passed down your throat and into your stomach.\nImages of your oesophagus (tube from your throat to your stomach) and stomach are transmitted to an external screen where any varices (swollen vessels),\u00a0which are a sign of cirrhosis, can be seen.\nGrading\nThere are several different grading systems for cirrhosis according to how serious it is. One system is the\u00a0Child-Pugh score which, based on your examination and laboratory tests, grades cirrhosis from A (relatively mild) to C (severe).\nAn alternative\u00a0system called\u00a0model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) uses the results of a blood test to help identify\u00a0people who need an urgent liver transplant.\n\n\nCirrhosis can't be cured, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and any complications and stop the condition getting worse.\nIt's usually not possible to reverse\u00a0liver damage that's already occurred, although recent research suggests this may eventually be possible in cases where the underlying cause of the liver damage can be successfully treated.\nTreatment is likely to take place at a hospital with a specialist hepatology unit, which treats disorders of the liver, gall bladder and biliary ducts.\nStopping\u00a0cirrhosis getting worse\nTaking medication to treat\u00a0the underlying cause of the liver damage\u00a0and making healthy lifestyle changes can help stop cirrhosis getting worse and reduce your risk of developing further health problems.\nThe medication you need will depend on the specific cause of the damage to your liver.\nFor example, if you have viral\u00a0hepatitis you may be prescribed anti-viral medications. If you have autoimmune hepatitis you may be given steroid medication (corticosteroids) or medication to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants).\nThere are a number of things you can do to help yourself stay healthy and reduce your chances of developing further problems if you have cirrhosis, including:\n\ncompletely avoid alcohol, regardless of the cause of your cirrhosis, as\u00a0alcohol consumption increases the rate at which the condition progresses\nlose weight\u00a0if you're overweight or obese\nregular\u00a0exercise to\u00a0reduce muscle wasting\npractise\u00a0good hygiene to reduce your chances of developing infections\nspeak to your GP about\u00a0vaccinations you may need, such as the annual flu vaccine or\u00a0travel vaccines\nspeak to your GP or pharmacist if\u00a0you're taking over-the-counter or prescription medications, as cirrhosis can affect the way your body processes some medicines\n\nMalnutrition\u00a0is common in people with cirrhosis, so it's important to ensure you have a\u00a0balanced diet to help you get all the nutrients you need.\nAvoiding salty foods and\u00a0not adding salt to foods you eat can help\u00a0reduce your risk of developing swelling in your\u00a0legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build up of fluid. See\u00a0tips for a lower salt diet for more information.\nThe damage to your liver can also\u00a0mean it's\u00a0unable to store glycogen,\u00a0a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you\u00a0may need extra calories and protein in your diet.\nHealthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein.\u00a0It may also be helpful to eat 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0small meals a day, rather than 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0large meals.\nEasing symptoms\nA number of treatments can ease the symptoms of cirrhosis, including:\n\na low-sodium (salt) diet or\u00a0tablets called diuretics\u00a0to reduce the amount of fluid in your body\ntablets to reduce high blood pressure in your portal vein (the main vein that transports blood from the gut to the liver) and prevent or treat any infection\ncreams to reduce itching\u00a0\n\nManaging complications of advanced cirrhosis\nIn cases of advanced cirrhosis, complications caused by the condition may\u00a0need treatment.\nIf you vomit blood or pass blood in your stools, you probably have swollen veins in your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These are known as oesophageal varices.\nIn these cases,\u00a0urgent medical attention is required. This means seeing your GP or going to the\u00a0accident and emergency (A&E) department of your nearest hospital immediately.\nCertain procedures can help stop the bleeding and reduce the risk of it happening again, such as:\n\nBanding \u2013 an\u00a0endoscopy is carried out (a thin, flexible tube is passed down your throat) and a small band is placed around the base of the varices to help control the bleeding.\nInjection glue therapy \u2013 following an endoscopy, a type of medical \"super glue\" is injected into the varices to make the blood clot, which helps to stop the bleeding.\nA Sengstaken tube with a balloon on the end \u2013 a special\u00a0tube is passed down your throat into your stomach and the balloon is inflated. This\u00a0puts pressure on the varices and helps stop the bleeding. You'll be heavily sedated during the procedure.\nA transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) \u2013 a metal tube called a stent is passed across your liver to join two large veins (the portal vein and hepatic vein). This creates a new route for your blood to flow through, therefore relieving the pressure that causes the varices.\n\nYou may also be given a type of medication called a beta-blocker, such as propanolol, to reduce the risk of bleeding or reduce the severity of any bleed that\u00a0does occur.\nAscites (a build-up of fluid around your stomach area) and peripheral oedema (fluid around your legs and ankles) are common complications of advanced cirrhosis. They'll need to be addressed as soon as possible.\nYou may have 20 to 30 litres of free water in your stomach area (abdomen), which can make it difficult for you to eat and breathe properly. The main treatments for ascites and oedema are restricting sodium (salt) in your diet and taking diuretic tablets, such as spironolactone or furosemide.\nIf the\u00a0fluid around your stomach becomes infected, you may need to be treated with antibiotics. Alternatively, antibiotics may be used on a regular basis\u00a0to prevent infection in people at high risk.\nIn severe cases of ascites, tubes may be used to drain the fluid from your abdomen. This will usually be repeated every few weeks.\nPeople with cirrhosis can sometimes develop problems with their brain function (encephalopathy). This occurs because the liver isn't clearing toxins properly.\nThe main treatment for encephalopathy is lactulose syrup. This acts as a laxative (it helps clear the bowels) and helps the body remove the toxins that build up in the body when the liver is failing. In some cases, other laxatives or an enema may be used.\nCirrhosis can affect the liver's ability to make the blood clot (thicken), leaving you at risk of severe bleeding if you cut yourself. Vitamin K and a blood product called plasma can be given in emergencies to treat episodes of bleeding. You'll need to apply pressure to any cuts that bleed.\nTherefore,\u00a0you should seek specialist advice before having medical procedures, including any dental work.\nLiver transplant\nYour liver may stop functioning if it's severely damaged by scarring. In this situation, a liver transplant is the only option. This is a major procedure that involves removing your diseased liver and replacing it with a healthy donor liver.\nHowever, you'll probably have to wait a long time for a liver transplant because there are more people waiting for a transplant than there are donors.\nThe NHSBT Organ Donation website has more information about transplants and joining the Organ Donor Register.\n\n\nYou can reduce your chances of developing cirrhosis by limiting your alcohol consumption and protecting yourself from a hepatitis infection.\nLimiting your alcohol consumption\nHeavy alcohol consumption is one of the most common causes of cirrhosis of the liver.\u00a0One of the best ways to avoid this\u00a0is to keep within\u00a0recommended limits.\n\nmen and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week\nspread your drinking over 3\u00a0days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week\n\nIf you have cirrhosis, you should stop drinking alcohol immediately because it speeds up the rate at which the condition progresses, regardless of the cause.\nRead more about alcohol misuse.\nProtect yourself from hepatitis\nCirrhosis can be caused by infectious conditions, such as hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis B and C can be caught through having unprotected sex or by sharing needles to inject drugs.\nUsing a condom when having sex will help you avoid the risk of getting hepatitis, as will avoiding injecting drugs.\nAnyone who's at risk of getting hepatitis B, such as police officers and social care workers, can be protected by being vaccinated against the condition. However, there's currently no vaccine for hepatitis C.\nPeople born in areas of the world where hepatitis B and C are widespread, such as parts of South Asia and Africa, need to be screened for hepatitis, as early treatment can help prevent the onset of cirrhosis.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Coeliac disease is a common autoimmune condition where the immune system in a person\u2019s intestine (gut) reacts when they eat gluten. This causes chronic inflammation.\nWhat is gluten?\nGluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.\nGluten is found in food and drink that contains wheat, barley and rye, such as:\n\nmost types of bread\npasta\ncakes\nbiscuits\ncrackers\nmany breakfast cereals\npastry\ncertain types of sauces\nsome types of ready meals\nmost beers and lagers\ncertain fruit squashes\n\nHow many people have coeliac disease?\nCoeliac disease affects 1 person in every 100. Only about one third of them are ever diagnosed.\nCoeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age.\nReported cases of coeliac disease are twice as high in women than men.\nSymptoms\nCoeliac disease can cause a wide range of symptoms in the digestive system and rest of the body.\nSymptoms can develop at any age, but coeliac disease is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60 years.\nMore about the symptoms of coeliac disease or what is coeliac disease?\nCauses\nCoeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions and in relatives of people with coeliac disease. It's unknown exactly why people develop the condition.\nMore about the causes of coeliac disease\nDiagnosis\nMost people with coeliac disease have antibodies in their blood. The first stage in diagnosis is a simple blood test. The second stage might result in a biopsy, if necessary.\nMore about how coeliac disease is diagnosed\nTreatment\nCoeliac disease can be effectively treated with a gluten-free diet. By adopting a gluten-free diet and lifestyle, you can manage your condition and improve your quality of life.\nMore about how coeliac disease is treated\nComplications\nIf coeliac disease isn't treated, you're at greater risk of conditions like osteoporosis and cancer in later life.\nMore about the complications of coeliac disease\nLiving well with coeliac disease\nLiving with coeliac disease can be challenging but with the right support and information, it's completely manageable.\n\n\nSymptoms of coeliac disease vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe.\nSome people may have no symptoms at all.\nSometimes the symptoms of coeliac disease are mistaken for:\n\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nwheat intolerance\nstress\njust getting older\n\nCommon symptoms\nSome common symptoms of coeliac disease include:\n\nsevere diarrhoea, excessive wind and/or constipation\npersistent or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting\nrecurrent stomach pain, cramping or bloating\niron, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency\nanaemia\ntiredness\nsudden or unexpected weight loss (but not in all cases)\nmouth ulcers\nskin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)\ndepression\nrepeated miscarriages\nneurological (nerve) problems such as ataxia (loss of coordination, poor balance) and peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in the hands and feet)\n\nIf you've any of these symptoms, speak to your GP. You must continue eating gluten as part of your diet until you've been diagnosed.\nYou can also take Coeliac UK's\u00a0online assessment.\nChildren with coeliac disease might also not grow at the expected rate, or be late to reach puberty.\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt's not known exactly why people develop coeliac disease or why some have mild symptoms while others have severe symptoms. It could be that a person's genetics and the environment play a part in why this condition develops.\nPre-exisiting conditions\nCoeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions \u2013 such as type 1 diabetes, Down's syndrome or autoimmune thyroid disease. Also, in close family members (parents or siblings) of people with coeliac disease.\nGenetics\nCoeliac disease often runs in families. If you've a close relative with the condition \u2013 such as a parent or sibling \u2013 your chance of developing it is higher.\nThis risk is approximately 10% for those with a family history, compared with 1% for someone without a close relative with the condition. If you have a close relative with coeliac disease and you have symptoms you should speak to your GP.\nIf you've an identical twin with coeliac disease, there's an 85% chance you'll also develop the condition.\n\n\nCoeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age, and both children and adults can show symptoms\nDelayed diagnosis is common. It can take an average of 13 years to diagnose.\nBlood tests\nMost people with coeliac disease have antibodies that show up in their blood. The first stage in diagnosis can be a blood test.\nA blood test should be offered if you've any of the following:\n\ntype 1 diabetes\nautoimmune thyroid disease\ndermatitis herpetiformis\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nanaemia without an obvious cause\ncertain symptoms related to your digestive system \u2013 such as frequent diarrhoea, abdominal pain or vomiting, nausea or sudden weight loss\nclose relatives (parents, siblings or children) with coeliac disease\n\nA blood test might also be offered if:\n\nyou feel tired all the time\na child is not growing as fast as expected\nyou've other symptoms or conditions that sometimes occur in people with coeliac disease \u2013 such as mouth ulcers, particular types of problems with your bones or liver, Down's syndrome, Turner syndrome or persistent constipation\n\nBlood tests for coeliac disease are not recommended for infants who've not started to eat foods containing gluten.\nBefore a blood test is taken, it's important that you eat gluten-containing foods in more than one meal every day for at least 6 weeks before the test.\nA blood test for coeliac disease involves taking a blood sample and testing it for antibodies in the blood.\nYou must have been eating gluten-containing food in more than 1 meal for at least 6 weeks before the test, for it to be successful.\nBlood tests are 95% accurate at diagnosing coeliac disease.\nIf the coeliac antibodies are found in your blood, further investigation will be needed. This'll be discussed with you.\nYour GP will refer you to your local coeliac service for confirmation of the diagnosis. You should remain on a normal diet until all investigations are complete.\nIt's sometimes possible to have coeliac disease and not have antibodies in your blood.\nIf you continue to have coeliac disease-like symptoms your GP may still refer you for a biopsy of your gut.\nBiopsy\nA biopsy can help confirm a diagnosis of coeliac disease.\nIf you're referred for a biopsy, this will be carried out in hospital. Usually, a biopsy will be done by a gastroenterologist. This is a doctor who specialises in treating conditions of the stomach and intestines.\nIf you need to have a biopsy, a thin flexible tube with a light called an endoscope will be inserted into your mouth or nose and passed down to your small intestine.\nBefore the procedure, a local anaesthetic is given to numb the throat and/or a sedative to help you relax.\nDuring the procedure, the endoscopist will pass a tiny biopsy tool through the endoscope to take samples of the lining of your small intestine. The sample will then be examined under a microscope for signs of coeliac disease.\nFor those under 16 years the endoscopy would be under an anaesthetic.\nDiet before and after testing\nYou should continue to eat gluten-containing foods every day until a diagnosis has been confirmed.\nA biopsy will only show coeliac disease if the person being tested has been eating gluten-containing foods regularly.\nOnly after coeliac disease is confirmed can you start a gluten-free diet.\nIf you're already on a gluten-free diet and find it hard to eat gluten again, your GP should refer you to a specialist. You may not be able to get gluten-free foods on prescription if you do not have coeliac disease confirmed by a biopsy.\nRead further information:\n\nDiet advice when being tested for Coeliac Disease\nNICE guidelines - coeliac disease recognition, assessment and management\nBSG guidelines on the diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease\nLynsey's diagnosis story\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with coeliac disease, you may also have other tests to assess how the condition has affected you so far.\nYou may have further blood tests to check levels of iron and other vitamins and minerals in your blood. This'll help check for anaemia.\nIn coeliac disease, a lack of nutrients caused by poor absorption can make bones weak and brittle (osteoporosis).\nA DEXA scan is a type of very low dose X-ray that measures bone density. This may be required if your risk score (FRAX/Qfracture) is high. This will be calculated as part of your assessment.\nYou can buy over-the-counter tests for coeliac disease at pharmacies. There isn't enough evidence that these tests are reliable.\nIf you've used one, it's important that you talk to your GP about the result.\nBefore a diagnosis can be confirmed, you'll still need to have a blood test and biopsy.\n\n\nThe only treatment for confirmed coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet.\nHow does a gluten-free diet help?\nFollowing a gluten-free diet helps prevent gluten damaging the lining of the intestines (gut). This will improve or remove the symptoms.\nA gluten-free diet will also help to prevent the complications later in life.\nWhat if I continue to eat gluten?\nIf you're diagnosed with coeliac disease and continue to eat foods that contain gluten, your symptoms will return and could cause long-term damage to your health.\nGluten-free food on prescription\nIf you've a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis, you can access gluten-free foods on prescription through your GP or Scottish Gluten-free Food Service.\nHow to register with the Scottish Gluten-free Food Service\u200b\nHow long does treatment take to work?\nSymptoms should improve within weeks of starting a gluten-free diet. However, it may take up to 2 years for the digestive system to heal completely.\nDietary advice\nAfter a confirmed diagnosis of coeliac disease, you'll be seen by a dietitian\u00a0for help with adjusting to your new gluten-free diet and lifestyle.\nThe dietitian will help by:\n\nmaking sure the diet is balanced and contains all the nutrients you need\nadvising how to adjust your diet and lifestyle to ensure it's gluten-free\n\nThe dietitian should provide you with:\n\nguidance on gluten-free food alternatives\ninformation on shopping, preparing, cooking and storing gluten-free foods\ninformation about gluten-free prescriptions and the Scottish Gluten-free Food Service\ndetails of local and national support groups\n\nMore about a dietitian's perspective\nDietary supplements\nAs well as adopting a gluten-free diet and lifestyle, your GP or dietitian might also recommend that you take vitamin and mineral supplements for at least the first 6 months after diagnosis. This will ensure that the you get all the nutrients you need while your digestive system repairs itself.\nTaking supplements can also help correct any deficiencies, such as anaemia (a lack of iron in the blood).\nFeeding your baby\nIf you've coeliac disease, you shouldn't introduce gluten into your baby\u2019s diet before it's 6 months old. Breast milk is naturally gluten-free and all infant milk formulas are too.\nFoods with gluten should be introduced slowly when a child is around 6 months old. The situation should be carefully monitored.\nVaccinations\nIf you have coeliac disease, you should get vaccinations for:\n\npneumococcus\nflu (annually)\n\nYou should discuss this with your GP or specialist before having any vaccinations.\nAnnual health checks\nAfter starting treatment, you'll need to have an annual coeliac disease health check to monitor your condition. This will be done by your GP, a dietitian or a pharmacist.\nAt this health check, they'll ask you:\n\nabout your health in relation to coeliac disease\nhow you're managing your gluten-free diet\n\nYou'll also be given the chance to discuss any concerns. Living with coeliac disease can be challenging but with the right support and information, it's completely manageable.\nMore about living well with coeliac disease\n\n\nComplications of coeliac disease only tend to affect people that continue to eat gluten, or in people that have taken a long time to diagnose.\nPossible complications of coeliac disease include:\n\nlactose intolerance\nnutritional deficiencies\nosteoporosis\ncancer\n\nLactose intolerance\nIf you've coeliac disease, you may also develop lactose intolerance because the body lacks the enzyme to digest milk sugar (lactose) found in dairy products.\nLactose intolerance is only temporary. It normally disappears when you follow a gluten-free diet.\nMore about lactose intolerance\nNutritional deficiencies\nSevere symptoms of coeliac disease can lead to malnutrition. However, this is rare.\nMore common is malabsorption where your body fails to absorb nutrients from the foods you eat. This can lead to anaemia if the body doesn't take in enough iron, and osteoporosis if there's not enough calcium and vitamin D being taken in.\nMore about nutritional deficiencies\nOsteoporosis\nOsteoporosis causes the bones to become brittle, weak and fracture more easily. Bones need a wide variety of vitamins and minerals to stay dense and strong.\nIf you've coeliac disease, you've an increased risk of developing osteoporosis due to the damaged gut failing to absorb key bone nutrients from food. This decreases blood vitamin and mineral levels and the body compensates for this by taking nutrients like calcium from the bones. This weakens your bones and puts you at increased risk of fracture.\nIf you have coeliac disease, you should make sure you're eating enough calcium and take vitamin D supplements.\nRead further information:\n\nNHS inform: Vitamin D\nNHS inform: osteoporosis\n\nCancer\nHaving undiagnosed or untreated coeliac disease can increase your risk of developing lymphoma and some types of bowel cancer but these are rare. Risks are reduced by following a gluten-free diet.\nLess common complications\nLess common complications of coeliac disease include low birth weight in newborn babies and in rare cases, hyposplenia.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Cold sores are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. They're caused by the herpes simplex virus and usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days.\nYou\u00a0may not\u00a0have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus. An outbreak of cold sores may\u00a0happen some time later.\nCold sores often start with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then appear, usually on the edges of your lower lip.\nRead more about the symptoms of cold sores.\nWhen to\u00a0get professional advice\n\u00a0\nIf you have cold sores you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory.\nCold sores aren't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.\nIf you've had outbreaks of cold sores before, it's likely that you'll know what they are if they return.\nYou only need to visit your pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's a cold sore or if it's severe and spreading further than just the lip. See your pharmacist\u00a0if\u00a0a cold sore hasn't healed after 7 to 10 days.\nWhat causes cold sores?\nThe strain of herpes simplex virus usually responsible for cold sores is known as HSV-1.\nIn rare cases,\u00a0cold sores\u00a0can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can\u00a0be the result of having oral sex with someone who has\u00a0genital herpes.\nRead more about the causes of cold sores.\nHerpes simplex virus\nThe herpes simplex virus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or \"cold sore virus\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time.\nHowever, every so often the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. These triggers vary from person to person, but can include sunlight,\u00a0fatigue, an injury to the affected area, and, in women, their period.\nSome people have frequently recurring cold sores around two or three times a year, while others have one cold sore and never have another. Some people never get cold sores at all because the virus never becomes active.\nTreating cold sores\nCold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days.\nHowever, antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. If used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time.\nTo be effective, these treatments\u00a0should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear\u00a0\u2013 when you\u00a0feel\u00a0a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect.\nCold sore patches are also available that contain hydrocolloid gel, which is an effective treatment for skin wounds. The patch is placed over the cold sore while it heals.\nAntiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases.\nRead more about treating cold sores.\nComplications of cold sores\nCold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. People with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications.\nDehydration sometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. Young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated.\nThe herpes simplex virus can also spread to other parts of your body. Examples of when this can occur include:\n\nskin infections\u00a0\u2013 these often\u00a0occur if the virus comes into contact with broken skin, such as a\u00a0cut or graze, or\u00a0a skin condition such as\u00a0eczema\nherpetic whitlow (whitlow finger)\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0causes\u00a0painful sores and blisters to appear on and around your fingers\nherpetic keratoconjunctivitis\u00a0\u2013 this causes swelling and irritation (inflammation) of your eye area and sores to develop on your eyelids\n\nLeft untreated, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of your eye, to become infected, which can eventually lead to blindness.\nIt's therefore important not to touch your eyes if you have an unhealed cold sore. If you must touch your eyes\u00a0\u2013 for example, to remove contact lenses\u00a0\u2013 wash your hands thoroughly first.\nIn very rare cases,\u00a0encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes inflamed and swollen, can be caused by the cold sore virus spreading to the brain. It can be treated with intravenous injections of antiviral medications, such as\u00a0aciclovir.\nPreventing infection\nIt's not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores, but you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection.\nCold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they're completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared.\nHowever, there's no need to stay away from work or miss school\u00a0if you or your child have a cold sore.\nYou can help minimise the risk of the cold sore virus spreading and cold sores recurring by following the advice below:\n\navoid touching cold sores unless you're applying cold sore cream\u00a0\u2013 creams should be dabbed on gently rather than rubbed in,\u00a0as this can damage your skin further\nalways wash your hands before and after applying cold sore cream and after touching the affected area\ndon't share cold sore creams or medication with other people\u00a0as this can cause the infection to spread\ndon't share items that come into contact with the affected area, such as lipsticks or cutlery\navoid kissing and oral sex until your cold sores have completely healed\nbe particularly careful around newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a low immune system, such as those with\u00a0HIV or those having chemotherapy\nif you know what usually triggers your cold sores, try to avoid the triggers\u00a0\u2013 for example, a sun block lip balm (SPF 15 or higher) may help prevent cold sores triggered by bright sunlight\n\n\n\nYou won't usually have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus (the primary infection).\nAn outbreak of cold sores may occur some time later and keep coming back (recurrent infection).\nHowever, if the primary infection does cause symptoms, they can be quite severe.\nHerpes simplex virus primary infection\nSymptoms of the primary infection are most likely to develop in children younger than five years old. Symptoms include:\n\nswollen and irritated gums with small, painful sores in and around the mouth\u00a0\u2013 this is known as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis\nsore throat\u00a0and swollen glands\nproducing more saliva than normal\nhigh temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\ndehydration\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nheadaches\u00a0\n\nHerpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also\u00a0develop it. It can last 7 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to three weeks to heal. However, gingivostomatitis doesn't usually recur after the primary infection.\nPrimary herpes simplex viruses are rare in adults, but the symptoms are similar to those experienced by children.\nYou'll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands. You may also have\u00a0bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth. These can develop into\u00a0ulcers with grey or yellow centres.\nIf you develop the herpes simplex virus at an early age, it may be triggered periodically in later life and can cause recurring bouts of cold sores. After the primary infection, the symptoms are usually reduced to just the cold sores themselves.\nRecurrent infections (cold sores)\nRecurrent infections usually last for less time and are\u00a0less severe than the primary infection. The only symptom is an outbreak of cold sores, although you may also have swollen glands.\nAn outbreak of cold sores usually starts with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then develop, usually on the edges of your lower lip.\nIf you have frequent recurrent infections, you may develop cold sores in the same place every time. They may grow in size and cause irritation and pain. Initially, they may ooze before crusting or scabbing over within 48 hours of the initial tingling sensation.\nIf the cold sores are very troublesome, it's possible to suppress them by taking an antiviral tablet called acyclovir regularly, every day for a few months. This is usually only recommended if cold sores are causing a lot of problems, and they may come back when treatment is stopped.\nMost cold sores disappear within 7 to 10 days without treatment and usually heal without scarring.\n\n\nCold sores are usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).\nIn most cases the virus is passed on in early childhood\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, when a child is kissed by a family member or friend with a cold sore.\nThe virus passes through the skin and travels up the nerves, where it lies inactive (dormant) until it's triggered at a later date.\nCold sore triggers\nFactors thought to trigger outbreaks of cold sores include:\n\nhaving another infection, such as a\u00a0respiratory tract infection\nhaving a high temperature (fever)\nemotional upset or psychological stress\ntiredness and fatigue\nan injury to the affected area\nmenstruation (periods)\nstrong sunlight\n\nHowever, in many cases there's no obvious trigger for an outbreak.\nHerpes simplex virus type 2\nOccasionally, cold sores can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).\nThis can happen after having oral sex with a man or woman who has genital herpes, which is usually caused by HSV-2.\nIn genital herpes, painful blisters develop on your genitals and the surrounding area.\n\n\nCold sores usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. Antiviral tablets or cream can be used to ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time.\nIf you develop a cold sore, some general advice to follow includes:\n\ndrink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration\navoid acidic or salty foods and eat cool, soft foods\nif brushing your teeth is painful, use an antiseptic mouthwash\ndab creams on to sores rather than rubbing\u00a0them in\nwash your hands using soap and water before and after applying cold sore creams\navoid touching your cold sores, other than to apply cream, and don't share your cold sore cream with others\n\nAntiviral creams and tablets\nAntiviral\u00a0creams such as\u00a0aciclovir or penciclovir (also known as Fenistil\u00ae) may speed up the healing time of a recurrent cold sore infection\u00a0if used correctly.\nCold sore\u00a0creams are widely available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription.\nThey're only effective if you apply them as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear, when the herpes simplex virus is spreading and replicating. Using an antiviral\u00a0cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much effect.\nIf you have frequently recurring bouts of cold sores,\u00a0use antiviral medication\u00a0as soon as you feel the tingling sensation that\u00a0indicates a cold sore is about to develop. You'll need to apply the cream up to five times a day for four to five days.\nAntiviral creams can only help to\u00a0heal a current outbreak of cold sores. They don't get rid of the herpes simplex virus or prevent future outbreaks of cold sores occurring.\nAntiviral tablets are generally more effective than creams at treating cold sores, but are usually only prescribed for more severe cases.\nCold sore patches\nCold sore patches that contain a special gel called hydrocolloid are also available. They're an effective treatment for skin wounds and are placed over the cold sore to hide the sore area while it heals.\nNon-antiviral treatments\nSeveral non-antiviral creams are also available over the counter\u00a0from pharmacies\u00a0without the need for a prescription.\nThese creams aren't specifically designed to treat cold sores and won't help them heal faster, but they\u00a0may help ease any pain or\u00a0irritation. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a suitable treatment for you.\nPain can also be treated with painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol\u00a0\u2013 both are available in liquid form for young children.\nHowever, don't take ibuprofen if you have\u00a0asthma or\u00a0stomach ulcers, or you've had them in the past.\nChildren under the age of 16 shouldn't be given aspirin.\nSpeak to your pharmacist if you have cold sores and you're pregnant.\nTreating complications\nIf your cold sores are particularly severe or your immune system is damaged\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have\u00a0HIV or you're having chemotherapy treatment \u2013\u00a0you may be at risk of developing serious complications.\nFor example, your risk of developing\u00a0encephalitis\u00a0or the infection spreading to other parts of your body, such as your eyes, is increased.\nSpeak to your GP if you're at risk. They\u00a0may prescribe antiviral tablets and refer you for specialist treatment.\nThe type of treatment recommended will depend on the severity of your cold sore symptoms and the complication that's causing problems.\nFor example, if you develop herpetic keratoconjunctivitis\u00a0\u2013 a secondary eye infection\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may need to see an ophthalmologist, a specialist eye doctor.\nGingivostomatitis\nVisit your pharmacist if you or your child develops\u00a0swollen, painful gums (gingivostomatitis) as a result of\u00a0the primary herpes simplex infection. They'll be able to suggest treatments to help ease your symptoms.\nIf the infection is painful, your pharmacist may suggest using a preparation that contains benzydamine, which is available as an\u00a0oral rinse or oral spray, to help relieve any pain in your mouth or throat.\nBrushing your teeth may also be painful because of the swelling of your gums. Your pharmacist may suggest using an antiseptic mouthwash. This helps prevent secondary infections and will also control a build-up of plaque if you can't brush your teeth effectively.\nAs with the treatment of cold sores, any pain or fever can be treated using ibuprofen or paracetamol.\nIn rare cases of gingivostomatitis, it's possible for your lips to become stuck together in places. Using a lip barrier cream available from your local pharmacist will help prevent this.\nIf you or your child has gingivostomatitis, it's important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Young children are particularly at risk\u00a0as they may refuse to eat or drink because of\u00a0the pain in their mouth.\nIt's important to watch out for signs of\u00a0dehydration, such as:\n\nheadaches\ntiredness\nirritability\nlightheadedness\nlow urine output\n\nMost cases of gingivostomatitis get better in 7 to 14 days, although it may take up to three weeks for the sores to heal completely.\nIf you or your child still has symptoms of gingivostomatitis after two weeks or the infection is severe your pharmacist may advise you to contact your GP, who may refer you for specialist treatment.\nSpecialist referral may also be needed for gingivostomatitis if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system.\nVisit your GP if you have a newborn baby who develops gingivostomatitis, as they may also need to be referred for specialist treatment.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "A cold is a mild viral infection of the nose, throat, sinuses and upper airways.

Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory.\nIf you or your child has a cold, there's usually no need to see your GP\u00a0as it should clear within a week or two.\nYou only really need to\u00a0contact your GP if:\n\nyour symptoms persist for more than three weeks\nyour symptoms get suddenly worse\nyou have breathing difficulties\nyou develop complications of a cold, such as chest pain or coughing up bloodstained mucus\n\nIt might also be a good idea to get advice from a GP if you're concerned about your baby or\u00a0an elderly person, or if you have a long-term illness such as a lung condition. You can also phone NHS 24's\u00a0111\u00a0service for advice.\nHow\u00a0do\u00a0colds spread?\u00a0\nIn general, a person becomes contagious from a few days before their symptoms begin until all of their symptoms have\u00a0gone. This means most people will be infectious for around two weeks.\nYou can catch the virus from an infectious person by:\n\ntouching an object or surface contaminated by infected droplets and\u00a0then touching your mouth, nose or eyes\ntouching the skin of someone who has the infected droplets on their skin and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes\ninhaling tiny droplets of fluid that contain the cold virus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0these are launched into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes\n\nColds spread most easily among groups of people in constant close contact, such as families and children in school or day care facilities. They're also more frequent during the winter, although it's not clear exactly why.\nA\u00a0number of different\u00a0viruses can cause a cold, so it's possible to have several colds one after the other, as each one\u00a0may be\u00a0caused by a different virus.\nHow can I\u00a0stop a cold spreading?\nYou can take some simple steps to help prevent the spread of a cold. For example:\n\nwash your hands regularly, particularly\u00a0before touching your nose or mouth and before handling food\nalways sneeze and cough into tissues \u2013 this will help prevent the virus-containing droplets from your nose and mouth entering the air, where they can infect others; you should\u00a0throw away used tissues immediately and wash your hands\u00a0\nclean surfaces regularly to keep them free of germs\u00a0\nuse your own cup, plates, cutlery and kitchen utensils\ndon't share towels or toys with someone who has a cold\n\nIt's been suggested that vitamin C,\u00a0zinc\u00a0 and garlic supplements may help reduce your risk of getting a cold, but there's currently not enough strong evidence to support this.\nWhat's the difference between a cold and a flu?\n\n\n\nThe symptoms of a cold usually develop within a few days of becoming infected.\nThe main symptoms include:\n\na sore throat\na blocked or runny nose\nsneezing\na cough\na hoarse voice\ngenerally feeling unwell\n\nLess common symptoms of a cold include:\n\na high temperature (fever) \u2013 this is usually about 37-39C (98.6-102.2F)\na headache\nearache \u2013 severe earache may be a sign of a middle ear infection\nmuscle pain\nloss of taste and smell\nmild irritation of your eyes\na feeling of pressure in your ears and face\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe symptoms are usually at their worst during the first two to three days, before they gradually start to improve. In adults and older children, they usually last about 7 to 10 days, but can last longer. A cough in particular can last for two or three weeks.\nColds tend to last longer in younger children who are under five, typically lasting around 10 to 14 days. Read more about colds in children.\nIs it a cold or flu?\nIt can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have a cold or something potentially more serious such as flu, as the symptoms can be quite similar. The main differences are:\nFlu symptoms\n\ncome on quickly\nusually include a headache, fever and aching muscles\nmake you feel too unwell to continue your usual activities\n\nCold symptoms\n\ncome on gradually\nmainly affect your nose and throat\nare fairly mild, so you can still get around and are usually well enough to go to work\n\n\n\nYou can manage cold symptoms yourself by following some simple advice. You'll normally start to feel better within 7 to 10 days.\nGeneral advice\nUntil you're feeling better, it may help to:\n\ndrink plenty of fluids to replace those lost from sweating and having a runny nose\u00a0\neat healthily \u2013 a low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables\n\nYou may lose\u00a0your appetite when you have a cold. This is perfectly normal and should only last a few days. Don't force yourself to eat if you're not feeling hungry.\nYou may also wish to try some of the medications and remedies described below to help relieve your symptoms.\nOver-the-counter cold medications\nThe main medications used to treat cold symptoms are:\n\npainkillers \u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0paracetamol and\u00a0ibuprofen, which can help\u00a0relieve aches and a high temperature (fever)\ndecongestants\u00a0\u2013 which may help relieve a blocked nose\ncold medicines \u2013\u00a0containing a combination of painkillers and decongestants\n\nThese medications are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They're generally safe for older children and adults to take, but might not be suitable for babies, young children, pregnant women, people with certain underlying health conditions, and people taking certain other medications.\nAlways read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it, and follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you're not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.\nMore information about over-the-counter cold medicines is provided below.\nParacetamol and ibuprofen can help reduce a fever and also act as painkillers. Aspirin may also help, but it isn't normally recommended for a cold and should never be given to children under the age of 16.\nIf your child has a cold,\u00a0look for age-appropriate versions of paracetamol and ibuprofen (usually in liquid form). Always follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the correct dose is given.\nTaking both ibuprofen and paracetamol at the same time is not usually necessary for a cold and should be avoided\u00a0in children\u00a0as using both together may be unsafe.\u00a0\nParacetamol and ibuprofen are also included in some cold medicines. If you're taking\u00a0painkillers and want to also take a cold medicine, check the patient information leaflet first or ask your pharmacist or GP for advice to avoid exceeding the recommended dose.\nIf you're pregnant, paracetamol is the preferred choice to treat mild to moderate pain and fever.\nDecongestants can be taken by mouth (oral decongestants), or as drops or a spray into your nose (nasal decongestants). They can help make breathing easier\u00a0by reducing the swelling inside your nose.\nHowever, they're generally only effective for a short period and they can make your blocked nose worse if they're used for more than a week.\nDecongestants are not recommended for children under six years old and children under 12 years old shouldn't take them unless advised by a pharmacist or GP. They're also not suitable for people with certain underlying conditions and those taking certain medications.\nRead more about who can use decongestant medication\nOther remedies\nThe remedies outlined below may also help\u00a0relieve your symptoms.\nSome people find\u00a0gargling with salt water and sucking on menthol sweets can help relieve a\u00a0sore throat and blocked nose.\nVapour rubs can help babies and young children breathe more easily when they have a cold. Apply the rub to your child's chest and back. Don't apply it to their nostrils because this could cause\u00a0irritation and breathing difficulties.\nNasal saline (salt water) drops can help relieve a blocked nose in babies and young children.\nThere is some evidence to suggest that\u00a0taking\u00a0zinc supplements within a day of the symptoms starting will speed up recovery from a cold and reduce the severity of symptoms.\nHowever, there is currently little evidence to suggest that taking vitamin C\u00a0supplements is beneficial when a cold starts.\nTreatments\u00a0not recommended\nThe following treatments aren't usually recommended to treat colds because there isn't strong evidence to suggest they're effective, and they\u00a0may cause unpleasant side effects:\n\nantihistamines\ncough\u00a0treatments or syrups\nantibiotics \u2013 these are only effective against bacteria (colds are caused by viruses)\ncomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\u00a0treatments such as echinacea and Chinese herbal medicines\n\n\n\nColds usually clear up without causing any further problems. However, the infection can sometimes spread to your chest, ears or sinuses.\nSinusitis\nSinusitis is an infection of the small air-filled cavities inside the cheekbones and forehead. It develops\u00a0in up to\u00a01 in every 50 adults and older children who have a cold.\nSymptoms of sinusitis include:\n\npain and tenderness around your nose, eyes and forehead\u00a0(sinus headache)\na blocked and runny nose\na high temperature\u00a0of 38C (100.4F) or above\n\nIn most cases, the symptoms of sinusitis will resolve without the need for treatment.\u00a0See your GP if your symptoms don't improve after a week or they're getting worse.\nMiddle ear infection (otitis media)\nA middle ear infection (otitis media) develops in an estimated\u00a0one in every five children under the age of\u00a0five\u00a0with a cold.\nSymptoms of\u00a0a middle ear infection include:\n\nsevere earache\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\nflu-like symptoms, such as vomiting and a lack of energy\nsome loss of hearing\n\nMost middle ear infections will resolve without treatment within a few days. Treatment is usually only required if your child has repeated middle ear infections.\nChest infection\nA chest infection such as\u00a0bronchitis\u00a0and\u00a0pneumonia\u00a0can occur after a cold, as your immune system is temporarily weakened.\nSymptoms of a chest infection include a persistent cough, bringing up phlegm (mucus), and shortness of breath.\nMinor chest infections will resolve in a few weeks without specific treatment, but you\u00a0should see your GP if:\n\nyour cough is severe\nyou have a persistent high temperature\nyou become confused or disorientated\nyou have a sharp pain in your chest\nyou cough up bloodstained phlegm\u00a0\nyour symptoms last longer than three weeks\n\nIn these\u00a0cases, you could have a bacterial infection that needs to\u00a0be treated with antibiotics.\n\n\nYoung children get colds quite often because their immune system is still developing.\nIt can be worrying when your child gets a cold, but it's not usually serious and normally passes\u00a0within two weeks.\nBelow are the answers to some commonly asked questions about colds in children.\nIs my child's cold serious?\nColds aren't usually serious, although young children are at an increased risk of\u00a0developing further problems, such as\u00a0ear infections.\nVery occasionally, more serious problems such as\u00a0pneumonia can develop, so it's important to keep a close eye on your child.\nWhat\u00a0is the difference between adult and child colds?\nChildren\u00a0get colds far more often than adults.\u00a0While adults usually have two to four colds a year, children can catch as many as\u00a08 to 12.\nThe symptoms of a cold are generally similar in adults and children, including a blocked or runny nose, sneezing and a high temperature (fever).\nMost colds in children get better on their own without treatment, although they may take a little bit longer to recover than an adult would.\nSometimes it may seem as though you child has had a cold for a very long time, when in fact they've had several different minor infections with a short recovery time in between.\u00a0\nWhen should I see a doctor?\nYou should seek medical advice if:\n\nyour child is under three months old and has a temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above, or is between three and six months old and has a temperature of 39C (102.2F) or above\ntheir symptoms last more than three weeks\nthey\u00a0seem to be getting worse rather than better\nthey have chest pain or are coughing up bloodstained phlegm\u00a0\u2013 this could be a sign of a bacterial chest infection that needs treatment with\u00a0antibiotics\nthey're finding it difficult to breathe \u2013 seek medical help immediately from your GP\u00a0surgery or local hospital\nthey have, or seem to have, severe earache (babies with earache often rub their ears and seem irritable) as they could have an ear infection that may need antibiotic treatment\nthey have a persistent or severely sore throat\u00a0\u2013 they may have bacterial tonsillitis, which needs antibiotic treatment\nthey develop any other worrying symptoms\n\nWhy won't my doctor prescribe antibiotics?\nAntibiotics\u00a0are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Colds are caused by viruses, so do not respond to antibiotics.\nThe overuse of antibiotics can lead to\u00a0antibiotic resistance, where bacterial infections become less easily treatable.\nYour doctor is likely to prescribe antibiotics only if your child has developed a bacterial infection in addition to their cold.\nWhat can\u00a0I do to help my child?\nThe following tips may help your child cope with the symptoms of a cold:\n\nencourage your child to rest and make sure they drink plenty of fluids \u2013 water is fine, but warm drinks can be soothing\nif they have a blocked nose, you can make their breathing easier by raising the pillow end of your child's bed or cot by putting books or bricks under the legs, or placing a pillow under the mattress (although you shouldn't put anything under the mattress of a baby younger than one year old)\nliquid paracetamol or ibuprofen can help ease a fever and discomfort \u2013 check the dosage instructions on the packaging and never give aspirin to children under the age of\u00a016\na warm, moist atmosphere can ease breathing if your child has a blocked nose \u2013 take your child into the bathroom and run a hot bath or shower, or use a vaporiser to humidify the air\nkeep the room aired and at a comfortable temperature, and don't let your child get too hot \u2013\u00a0cover them with a lightweight sheet, for example\u00a0\n\nSpeak to your pharmacist or GP for advice if you're not sure how to look after your child or what medications are suitable for them to take.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Congenital heart disease is a general term used to refer to a series of birth defects that affect the heart.\nTypes of congenital heart disease\nThere are over 30 different types of heart defect.\nThe two main types of congenital heart disease are:\n\ncyanotic heart disease\nacyanotic heart disease\n\nCyanotic heart is where problems with the heart mean there isn't enough oxygen present in the blood.\nBabies born with cyanotic heart disease generally have a blue-coloured tinge to areas such as their fingers, toes and lips because of a lack of oxygen.\u00a0\nThey may also experience symptoms of:\n\nbreathlessness\nchest pain\npalpitations\nfainting\nfatigue\n\nAcyanotic heart disease is where the blood contains enough oxygen but it's pumped abnormally around the body.\nBabies born with acyanotic heart disease may not have any apparent symptoms but, over time, the condition can cause health problems.\nIn this group of conditions there can be a significant increase in blood pressure, putting the heart under more strain as it works much harder. This can weaken the heart, and increases the risk of developing heart failure, where the muscle is unable to efficiently pump blood around the body.\nIn addition, the blood pressure in the lungs is often too high. This is known as pulmonary hypertension and can damage the lungs and cause symptoms such as:\n\nbreathlessness\nfatigue\ndizziness\nfainting\n\nHow common is congenital heart disease?\nCongenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, with 1 in 180 babies being born with the condition.\nSome babies born with congenital heart disease will require immediate surgery after birth, while many others will probably require surgery or medication at some point during their childhood. \u00a0\nCongenital heart disease can sometimes develop alongside certain genetic conditions, such as Down\u2019s syndrome.\nAn infection during pregnancy, such as\u00a0rubella, can also cause congenital heart disease.\nHowever, many cases of congenital heart disease have no clear cause.\nOutlook for congenital heart disease\nThe outlook for congenital heart disease varies depending on the type and severity of the heart defect. \u00a0\u00a0\nResearch into the causes and improved treatments have meant that, 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood.\u00a0\nThis poses new challenges for healthcare services because some of these adults have complex health needs and require life-long specialised care. In response to this, the Department of Health has recommended the creation of specialised centres to care for adults with congenital heart disease.\u00a0\nCongenital heart disease in adults is sometimes known as \u2018grown-up congenital heart disease\u2019 (GUCH) or Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).\n\n\nAs stated in the introduction, the two main types of congenital heart disease are:\n\ncyanotic heart disease\nacyanotic heart disease\n\nSymptoms of cyanotic heart disease\nThe symptoms of cyanotic heart disease include:\n\na blue coloured tinge to the lips, fingers and toes (cyanosis)\npalpitations\nfainting\nfatigue\nchest pains\nbreathing problems\n\nChildren with cyanotic heart disease have lower levels of oxygen in their blood, this is known as hypoxia.\nSometimes, their oxygen levels can fall further and cause additional symptoms such as anxiety and confusion or disorientation.\nSymptoms of acyanotic heart disease\nThe symptoms of acyanotic heart disease include:\n\nsevere tiredness\npalpitations\nchest pain\nshortness of breath (particularly during activities such as climbing the stairs)\n\nCommon symptoms of congenital heart disease\nThere are some symptoms that are present in both cyanotic and acyanotic heart disease.\nThese include:\n\npoor appetite and feeding difficulties\nsweating, particularly when a baby is feeding\ndelayed growth\n\nChildren with acyanotic heart disease are usually underweight, and children with cyanotic heart disease are usually underweight and small for their age.\n\n\nTo understand how congenital heart disease can affect your child\u2019s heart and general health, it's useful to first understand how a healthy heart works.\nFind out how your heart works, on the British Heart Foundation website.\nCongenital heart disease develops when abnormalities in the heart\u2019s structure prevent it from working as it should.\nAs outlined in the introduction, the two main types of congenital heart disease are:\n\ncyanotic heart disease\nacyanotic heart disease\n\nFind common causes of each below.\nCommon types of acyanotic heart disease\nVentricular septal defect (VSD) is a very common cause of acyanotic heart disease. In cases of VSD, there is a hole between the left and right ventricle.\u00a0\nAs blood pressure is higher on the left-hand side of the heart, blood is pushed through the hole and into the right ventricle.\nThe heart then has to work harder to pump the excess blood out of the right ventricle, which can put a strain on the heart. The excess level and pressure of the blood can also increase the blood pressure in the lungs and damage them (pulmonary hypertension).\nAtrial septal defect (ASD) is a similar type of defect to VSD, but the hole is between the left and right atria rather than the ventricles.\nASD can place extra strain on the heart, and potentially damage the lungs.\nWhen referring to a \u2018hole in the heart\u2019, healthcare professionals are usually referring to either VSD or ASD.\nFind out more about ASD on the British Heart Foundation website.\nIn pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve in the right side of the heart is unusually narrow meaning that the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the lungs, which can put a strain on the heart.\nFind out more about pulmonary stenosis on the British Heart Foundation website.\nIn aortic stenosis, the aortic valve in the left side of the heart is unusually narrow, which means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve.\nBecause the aortic valve is the main route for oxygen-rich blood to supply the body, the narrowing can lower the body\u2019s oxygen supply, which can cause symptoms of breathlessness and dizziness.\nFind out more about aortic stenosis on the British Heart Foundation website.\nPatent ductus ateriosus (PDA) is a duct or passage in the heart that is meant to close shortly after birth.\nWhen an unborn baby is in the womb, there is no need for the baby\u2019s heart to send blood to the lungs because the baby is getting all the oxygen it needs from the mother through the placenta.\nTherefore, the ductus ateriosus acts as a bypass, meaning that the blood can flow back into the heart without entering the lungs.\nShortly after birth, the duct should close as the baby begins to breathe normally. However, in cases of PDA, the duct fails to completely close, which means that some oxygen-rich blood that is meant to be pumped away from the lungs leaks back through the duct and back into the lungs.\nThis can place strain on the heart and the lungs because they have to work harder to compensate for the problems caused by the duct.\nCommon types of cyanotic heart disease\nTetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cause of cyanotic heart disease. TOF is not one heart defect but a combination of four different heart defects. Tetralogy is a Greek word that means \u2018four-fold\u2019, and Fallot is the name of the doctor who first identified the condition.\nIn cases of TOF, there are four defects that affect the heart:\n\nA hole between the left and right ventricle (Ventricular Septal Defect).\nA narrowing of the pulmonary valve (pulmonary stenosis).\nThe muscles of the right ventricle are unusually thick (right ventricular hypertrophy).\nThe aorta sits over both the left and right ventricles, instead of just the left ventricle in a normal heart (overriding aorta).\n\nAs a result of this complex set of heart defects, oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-low blood become mixed. This leads to blood with lower-than-normal oxygen content being pumped around the body.\nAs the body\u2019s cells and tissue are not receiving enough oxygen, the child will develop symptoms of cyanotic heart disease.\nFind out more about TOF on the British Heart Foundation website.\nTransposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a major cause of cyanotic heart disease.\nIn cases of TGA, the pulmonary artery is attached to the left side of the heart, and the aorta is attached to the right side of the heart. This leads to oxygen-low blood, which should be pumped into the lungs, being pumped around the body, causing symptoms of cyanotic heart disease.\nFind out more about TGA on the British Heart Foundation website.\nRisk factors for congenital heart disease\nIn many cases of congenital heart disease, there is no clear reason why a baby is born with a defective heart.\u00a0\nThe known risk factors for congenital heart disease are listed below.\nWomen with diabetes are five times more likely to give birth to a baby with congenital heart disease compared with women who do not have diabetes.\nIt is estimated that out of every 100 pregnancies in women with diabetes, three to four will result in the birth of a baby with a heart defect.\u00a0\nThe increased risk is thought to be due to the high levels of insulin in the blood, which may interfere with the development of the foetus.\nThe viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) is a major risk factor for congenital heart disease if a woman contracts an infection during early pregnancy.\nIf a woman contracts the viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, there is an 80% chance that her baby will be born with a birth defect, such as congenital heart disease.\nMothers who exceed the recommended daily alcohol intake during pregnancy have an increased risk of their baby being born with congenital heart disease.\u00a0\nAlcohol is best avoided during pregnancy; however no more than 2-3 units should be consumed on a daily basis for any adult.\nThere are a number of genetic conditions (health conditions that a baby inherits from one or both parents) that can cause congenital heart disease.\nDown\u2019s syndrome is the most widely known genetic condition that can cause congenital heart disease. Down\u2019s syndrome is a condition where children are born with a range of disabilities as the result of a genetic abnormality. Approximately half of children with Down\u2019s syndrome will have congenital heart disease.\nOther genetic conditions linked to congenital heart disease include:\n\nTurner syndrome\nNoonan syndrome\n\n\n\nAn increasing number of cases of congenital heart disease are now diagnosed by carrying out a foetal echocardiograph before a baby is born.\nA foetal echocardiograph is made possible by using a type of ultrasound scanner that has been specially designed to build a picture of the unborn baby\u2019s heart. It should be carried out during routine antenatal examinations, usually sometime between the 18th and 20th week of pregnancy.\nIt is not always possible to detect heart defects (particularly mild ones) using a foetal echocardiography.\nPostnatal diagnosis\nIf a baby is born with cyanotic heart disease, a diagnosis can usually be made quickly and confidently due to the distinctive blue colour of their skin.\nIf your baby is born with acyanotic heart disease, their symptoms may not become immediately apparent for several months, or possibly years, after birth.\u00a0\nPossible signs that your child may have a cyanotic heart disease include:\n\nproblems feeding\nslow growth\nshortness of breath after exercising\ntiredness after exercising\nswelling of their hands, feet and ankles\n\nYou should contact your GP if your child has any of the above symptoms. Further testing can confirm or disprove a diagnosis of congenital heart disease.\nFurther testing\u00a0\nAn echocardiogram may be used to check your child\u2019s heart. Sometimes, underlying problems with the heart, which were missed during a foetal echocardiogram, can be detected as a child grows up.\nFind out more about an echocardiogram on the British Heart Foundation website.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the child\u2019s heart. Electrodes are placed on the skin across the chest, arms and legs, and then connected to an ECG machine. The machine analyses the electrical signals produced by the heart in order to assess the heart rhythm.\nFind out more about an ECG on the British Heart Foundation website.\nA chest X-ray of the heart and lungs can check whether there are any abnormalities in the lungs, or whether the heart is larger than normal. Both of these can be signs of congenital heart disease.\nFind out more about a chest x-ray on the British Heart Foundation website.\nPulse oximetry is a test that measures how much oxygen is present in the blood.\u00a0\nThe test involves placing a special sensor on your child\u2019s fingertip, ear or toe. The sensor sends out light waves. A computer that is connected to the sensor measures how the light waves are being absorbed, and gives a percentage reading.\u00a0\nA healthy person should have a reading of 94% or above. It is common for those with cyanotic heart defects to have readings below this value.\nCardiac catheterisation is a useful way of finding out more information about exactly how the blood is pumping through the child\u2019s heart.\nDuring a cardiac catheterisation, a small flexible tube, known as a catheter, will be inserted into one of the child\u2019s blood vessels, usually in the groin or arm. The tube is moved up into the heart, using X-rays to help guide it.\nA contrast dye that shows up on X-rays can be injected into the tube. The dye can then be studied as it moves through the heart, enabling medical staff to see how well each chamber of the heart is working. Blood pressure readings in different parts of the heart can also be taken; this will help with diagnosis and treatment planning.\nCardiac catheterisation is usually performed under a local anaesthetic and is a relatively painless procedure.\n\n\nThere are a number of different surgical techniques that can be used to treat congenital heart disease. Some of these are explained below.\nCatheters\nA catheter, similar to the tube that is used during diagnosis, is inserted into the heart and tools are passed down the catheter to repair the heart defects.\nThe advantage of this type of surgery is that it's minimally invasive, which means that your child will not have to have open heart surgery.\nOpen heart surgery\nFor more serious types of heart defects, it may be necessary to operate directly on the heart.\nDuring open heart surgery, the heart may be stopped and a machine used to pump blood around your child\u2019s body (bypass machine). An incision is made in your child\u2019s chest so that the heart defects can be surgically repaired, or damaged parts of the heart, such as the valves, can be replaced.\nHeart transplant\nIn more serious cases of congenital heart disease, the heart may be too damaged, and the child too ill, for corrective surgery to be safely carried out. In this circumstance, their heart may have to be replaced with a donated heart.\nIf your child requires a heart transplant, their details will be placed on the National Transplant Database (NTD). Depending on the condition of your child\u2019s heart, it may be necessary to keep them in hospital in order to support the function of their heart until a donated heart becomes available. Machines, such as the ventricle assist device (VAD), act like an external mechanical heart, and can assist in pumping blood around the body.\nPriority for heart transplants is based on clinical need, rather than on a first-come-first-served basis. If your child is in a very unstable condition, they will be prioritised whereas more stable children will have to wait for a longer period of time.\nOnce a donated heart of the right size and blood group becomes available, you will be contacted by the transplant team and asked to go to the transplant unit as soon as possible. You may be given a bleeper so that you can be contacted as soon as possible.\nFind out more about heart transplantation on the British Heart Foundation website.\nTreatment for common types of congenital heart disease\nSpecific treatments for the most common types of congenital heart disease are described below.\nIf your child is diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or an atrial septal defect (ASD), the recommended treatment will depend on the size of the defect.\nIf the defect is small, a policy of \u2018watchful waiting\u2019 may be recommended, where your child receives no immediate treatment but their health is carefully monitored. This is because 90% of small defects will close as the child grows older.\nIn cases of mild to medium-sized defects, it may be possible to seal the defect using a catheter. The catheter is guided to the site of the hole, and a specially designed mesh is passed through the catheter to seal the defect.\nIn cases of medium to large-sized defects, open-heart surgery may be required. This involves a patch being stitched directly over the defect.\nIf your child is diagnosed with a stenosis (a narrowing one of their valves) the treatment that is recommended will depend on the extent of the stenosis and if they are symptomatic.\nIn mild cases, a policy of \u2018watchful waiting\u2019 may be recommended. Medication that lowers blood pressure may also be recommended to reduce the strain on your child\u2019s heart and lungs.\nIn more serious cases of stenosis, a catheter can be used to widen the valve. A small balloon is passed up through the catheter and then inflated to widen the affected valve. This is known as a balloon angioplasty. Once the valve has been widened, the balloon is removed. Sometimes, a metal coil (stent) is used to keep the valve widened.\nIn more serious cases of stenosis, it's sometimes necessary to replace the valve using open heart surgery. Replacement valves can be obtained from human donors, or made from artificial materials, such as titanium, or taken from pigs and modified for human use. Pigs are used because their hearts are the most similar to the human heart.\nFor people who are too ill or weak to withstand the effects of open heart surgery, a catheter approach can be used. The catheter is passed through a blood vessel in the groin and up into the heart. A replacement valve is passed through the catheter and into position.\nMany cases of patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) can be treated shortly after birth, using medication.\nTwo types of medication - indomethacin and a special type of ibuprofen - have been shown to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct that is responsible for PDA.\nIf a PDA does not respond to medication, a catheter can be used to seal the duct with a metal coil or plug.\nBabies born with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) who are experiencing severe symptoms of breathlessness may require emergency surgery such as a Blalock-Taussig shunt (a BT shunt).\nDuring a BT shunt, an artery is diverted (or shunted) into the lungs so that a supply of oxygen-rich blood becomes available. Further open-heart surgery is then recommended when the baby is old enough to withstand the after-effects of surgery. During open-heart surgery, the defect between the ventricles is sealed and the pulmonary valve is widened.\nTransposition of the great arteries (TGA) will require open-heart surgery, which is usually done shortly after your baby is born.\nA surgical technique, known as an arterial switch, is usually used to treat cases of TGA. During an arterial switch, the affected arteries are cut and reattached to their correct position on the other side of the heart.\nCongenital heart disease in adulthood\nAbout 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. Living as an adult with congenital heart disease involves a new set of challenges. Some adults will require specialised care.\nRoutine medical procedures, such as giving birth or having a general anaesthetic, will need to be closely supervised by specialist staff with experience in treating adults with congenital heart disease. There is also the risk that previous heart surgery, such as the insertion of a replacement valve, will fail and that further surgery will be required.\nDue to these factors, it's recommended that older teenagers register with a specialised adult congenital heart disease clinic. The clinic will be able to provide regular check-ups and assessments, liaise with other specialised medical services as required, and provide on-going support and advice.\nYour GP or treatment team can give you more information about services in your area for adults with congenital heart disease.\n\n\nMany children with congenital heart disease will experience delays in their development, and may take longer to reach certain stages in their development, such as walking or talking.\nSome children with congenital heart disease also have associated learning difficulties and require specialised educational and psychological assistance.\nIf your child has congenital heart disease, your local educational authority should draw up an individual education plan (IEP). The IEP makes an assessment of your child\u2019s current and future needs, and provides access to any specialised services that your child needs, such as speech and language therapy or an educational psychologist.\nThe IEP will take into account what level of physical activity is safe for your child. Children with congenital heart disease should be encouraged to be as active as possible, but certain activities, such as contact sports, may have to be avoided.\nEndocarditis\nBoth children and adults with congenital heart disease have an increased risk of developing endocarditis.\nEndocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart and, left untreated, it can be life-threatening because it damages the valves of the heart.\nSymptoms of endocarditis include:\n\nfever\nchills\nsweating (including night sweats)\nmuscular aches and pains\nchest pain\ncoughs\nweakness and fatigue\nheadache\nshortness of breath\n\nEndocarditis will need to be with injections of antibiotics (intravenous antibiotics). This will involve a hospital stay for several weeks.\nEndocarditis usually develops when an infection in another part of the body, such as on the skin or the gums spreads through the blood into the heart.\nDue to the risk of gum disease leading to endocarditis, it is very important that you have excellent oral hygiene if you have congenital heart disease.\nIt is also usually recommended that you avoid having any cosmetic procedure that involves the piercing of the skin, such tattoos or body piercings.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Conjunctivitis is a common condition that causes redness and inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the front of the eye (the conjunctiva).\nPeople often refer to conjunctivitis as red eye.\nOther symptoms of conjunctivitis include itchiness and watering of the eyes, and sometimes a sticky coating on the eyelashes (if\u00a0it's caused by an\u00a0allergy).\nRead more about the symptoms of conjunctivitis\nConjunctivitis can affect one eye at first, but usually affects both eyes after a few hours.\nWhat causes conjunctivitis?\nThe conjunctiva can become inflamed as a result of:\n\na bacterial or viral infection \u2013 this is known as infective conjunctivitis\nan allergic reaction to a substance such as pollen or dust mites \u2013 this is known as allergic conjunctivitis\nthe eye coming into contact with things that can irritate the conjunctiva, such as\u00a0shampoo or chlorinated water, or a loose eyelash rubbing against the eye \u2013 this is known as irritant conjunctivitis\n\nRead more about the causes of conjunctivitis\nTreating conjunctivitis\nTreatment isn't usually needed for conjunctivitis, because the symptoms often clear up within a couple of weeks. If treatment is needed, the type of treatment will depend on the cause. In severe cases, antibiotic eye drops can be used to clear the infection.\nIrritant conjunctivitis will clear up as soon as whatever is causing it is removed.\nAllergic conjunctivitis can usually be treated with anti-allergy medications such as antihistamines. If possible, you should avoid the substance that triggered the allergy.\nIt's best not to wear contact lenses until the symptoms have cleared up. Any sticky or crusty coating on the eyelids or lashes can be cleansed with cotton wool and water.\nWashing your hands regularly and not sharing pillows or towels will help prevent it spreading.\nRead more about treating conjunctivitis\nWork and school\nPublic Health\u00a0Scotland\u00a0(PHS) advises that you don't need to stay away from work or school if you or your child has conjunctivitis, unless you (or they) are\u00a0feeling particularly unwell.\nIf there are a number of conjunctivitis cases at your child's school or nursery, you may be advised to keep them away until their infection has cleared up.\nGenerally, adults who work in close contact with others, or share equipment such as phones and computers, shouldn't return to work until the discharge has cleared up.\nComplications\nConjunctivitis can be a frustrating condition\u00a0\u2013 particularly allergic conjunctivitis\u00a0\u2013 but in most cases it doesn't pose a serious threat to health.\nComplications of conjunctivitis are rare, but when they do occur they can be serious and include:\n\na severe case of allergic conjunctivitis can lead to scarring in the eye\nin cases of infective conjunctivitis, the infection can spread to other areas of the body, triggering more serious secondary infections, such as meningitis\n\nRead more about the complications of conjunctivitis\n\n\nThe symptoms of conjunctivitis will depend on what's causing the condition.\nHowever,\u00a0the 2 main symptoms are usually:\n\neye redness \u2013 as a result of the inflammation and widening of the tiny blood vessels in the conjunctiva (the thin layer of cells covering the front of the eyes)\na discharge \u2013 the conjunctiva contains thousands of cells that produce mucus and tiny glands that produce tears\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inflammation causes the glands to become overactive, so that they produce more water and mucus\n\nOnly one eye\u00a0tends to be\u00a0affected at first,\u00a0but symptoms usually\u00a0affect both eyes\u00a0within a few hours.\nInfective conjunctivitis\nIf you have infective conjunctivitis, you may also have:\n\na burning sensation in your eyes\na feeling of grit in\u00a0your eyes\na sticky coating on the eyelashes\u00a0\u2013 usually when you first wake up in the morning\nan enlarged lymph node (gland) in front of the ear\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis\nYou may have itchy eyes\u00a0if you have allergic conjunctivitis.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe pattern of symptoms for allergic conjunctivitis depends on the substance you're allergic to.\nAllergies\u00a0to\u00a0pollen (hay fever) occur during certain parts of the year. You can have an allergy to:\n\ntree pollen, released during spring\ngrass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer\nweed pollen, released any time from early spring to late autumn\n\nIt's highly likely that the pollen will also cause other symptoms, such as sneezing and\u00a0a runny or blocked nose.\nAllergies to dust mites or animal fur cause symptoms throughout the year. Both eyes are usually affected and you may find the symptoms worse in the morning.\nSome people develop an allergy to eye drops. This is known as contact dermatoconjunctivitis and it can also affect your eyelids, causing them to become dry and sore.\nSome people are allergic to wearing contact lenses, which is known as giant papillary conjunctivitis. The symptoms progress much more slowly and you may also develop small spots on the inside of your upper eyelids.\u00a0This type of conjunctivitis carries a high risk of complications, so you need to seek medical advice as soon as possible.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nMost cases of conjunctivitis aren't a cause for concern, but you should contact your optician if you think you have it, particularly if you think it's related to wearing contact lenses.\nYour optician can check whether there's a more serious underlying cause of your symptoms.\nWhen to seek immediate medical advice\nThe following symptoms could be the sign of a more serious eye condition:\n\npain in your eyes\nsensitivity to light (photophobia)\ndisturbed vision\nintense redness in one eye or both eyes\n\nContact your optician immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. If this isn't possible, visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.\n\n\nConjunctivitis is a condition that occurs when the conjunctiva (a thin layer of cells covering the front of your eyes) becomes inflamed.\nThe 3 most common causes of this inflammation are:\n\ninfection (infective conjunctivitis)\nan allergic reaction (allergic conjunctivitis)\nsomething irritating the conjunctiva, such as a loose eyelash (irritant conjunctivitis)\n\nThese are\u00a0discussed in more detail below.\nInfective conjunctivitis\nEye infections are most commonly caused by:\n\nbacteria\u00a0\u2013 for example, the strains of bacteria that\u00a0often cause lung and ear infections\na virus\u00a0\u2013 most commonly an adenovirus that may also cause a sore throat and high temperature (fever)\nsexually transmitted infections (STIs)\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0chlamydia or gonorrhoea\n\nViral conjunctivitis causes a watery discharge, while the discharge from bacterial conjunctivitis contains pus. An eye swab\u00a0can also determine the cause of the infection (read more about diagnosing conjunctivitis).\nYou're more likely to develop infective conjunctivitis if you've been in close contact with someone who's already infected with it.\nIt's therefore very important to wash your hands thoroughly after coming into contact with anyone who has infective conjunctivitis. You should also avoid sharing pillows or towels with anyone with the infection.\nYou may be more at risk of getting infective conjunctivitis if:\n\nyou're old or young \u2013 it's more common in children and the elderly, possibly because children come into contact with more infections at school, and elderly people may have a weaker immune system\nyou've recently had an upper respiratory tract infection \u2013 such as a cold\nyou have diabetes or another condition that weakens your immune system \u2013 as you may be more vulnerable to infections\nyou're taking corticosteroids (steroids)\u00a0\u2013 which can weaken your immune system\nyou have blepharitis (inflammation of the rims of the eyelids)\u00a0\u2013 which can be caused by a bacterial infection and may lead to conjunctivitis\nyou've been in a crowded place \u2013 such as a busy train\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis\nAllergic conjunctivitis is caused when your eyes come into contact with an allergen (a particular substance that causes your immune system to react abnormally). This is known as an allergic reaction.\nThere are 4 main types of allergic conjunctivitis:\n\nseasonal allergic conjunctivitis\nperennial allergic conjunctivitis\ncontact dermatoconjunctivitis\ngiant papillary conjunctivitis\n\nSeasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are usually caused by:\n\npollen from grass, trees or flowers\ndust mites\nflakes of dead animal skin\n\nThese types of conjunctivitis are more common in people who also have other allergies, such as\u00a0asthma,\u00a0and often occur with\u00a0allergic rhinitis.\nContact dermatoconjunctivitis is\u00a0usually caused by eye drops, but it can also be caused by make-up or chemicals.\nGiant papillary conjunctivitis is caused by:\n\ncontact lenses\nstitches used in eye surgery\na prostheses (artificial) part of the eye that's fitted during eye surgery\n\nGiant papillary conjunctivitis is estimated to affect around 1% to 5% of people who use soft contact lenses and 1% of people who use hard contact lenses.\nIrritant conjunctivitis\nIrritant conjunctivitis can have a wide range of potential causes. Some common causes include:\n\nchlorinated water used in swimming pools\u00a0\nshampoo\na stray eyelash rubbing against the conjunctiva\nsmoke or fumes\n\n\n\nYour optician should be able to diagnose conjunctivitis by asking about your symptoms and examining your eyes.\nDescribing how your conjunctivitis started can help your optician diagnose which type it is and decide whether it needs to be treated.\nThe most common symptoms of infective conjunctivitis are sticky, red and watery eyes. However, infective conjunctivitis can sometimes be confused with other types of conjunctivitis, which are treated differently.\nSwab test\nYour optician may suggest further tests, such as a swab test, if your conjunctivitis hasn't responded to treatment, or to help decide what treatment to use. \u00a0\nA swab looks similar to a cotton bud. It's used to collect a small sample of mucus from your infected eye, which is sent to\u00a0a laboratory to find out the cause of your conjunctivitis.\nIf your symptoms are severe or don't respond to treatment, you may need to see an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).\nOther conditions\nMost cases of\u00a0conjunctivitis clear up within 1 to 2 weeks without needing any medical treatment. In some cases, it can last for longer than 2 weeks, which is known as persistent infective conjunctivitis.\nIf you have any unusual symptoms, such as severe pain, blurred vision or sensitivity to light, it may mean that you have a more serious condition.\nIf you have any of these symptoms, it's very important to seek medical assistance immediately, either by contacting your optician or going to your nearest hospital.\nOther more serious\u00a0conditions include:\n\nacute glaucoma \u2013\u00a0a rare form of glaucoma that causes a painful build-up of pressure in your eye\nkeratitis \u2013 where the cornea (the clear layer at the front of your eye) becomes swollen and develops open sores\niritis \u2013\u00a0a type of\u00a0uveitis (swelling of the middle layer of your eye) that causes pain,\u00a0headaches and\u00a0watery eyes\n\nNewborn babies\nContact your optician straight away if you think your baby may have infective conjunctivitis (also called neonatal conjunctivitis).\nIf this isn't possible, call\u00a0NHS 24's '111' service\u00a0or your local out-of-hours service. Your optician will examine your baby closely to see if they have sticky eyes or infective conjunctivitis.\nAll newborn babies with infective conjunctivitis must be referred to an eye specialist straight away for treatment.\nRead more about the symptoms of infective conjunctivitis\n\n\nThe recommended treatment for conjunctivitis will depend on whether it's caused by infection, an allergic reaction or an irritant, such as a stray eyelash.\nInfective conjunctivitis\nMost cases of infective conjunctivitis don't need medical treatment and clear up in 1 to 2 weeks.\nThere are several ways you can treat infective conjunctivitis at home:\n\nremove your contact lenses\u00a0\u2013 if you wear contact lenses, take them out until all the symptoms of the infection have gone; don't re-use old lenses after the infection has gone because they could be a potential source of re-infection; always use new lenses, solutions and cases after an infection\nuse lubricant eye drops \u2013 these are available over the counter at pharmacies or they may be prescribed for you; they may help ease any soreness and stickiness in your eyes; always follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions\ngently clean away sticky discharge from your eyelids and lashes using cotton wool soaked in water\nwash your hands regularly \u2013 this is particularly important after touching your eyes and will stop the infection spreading to others\n\nAntibiotics\u00a0aren't usually prescribed for infective conjunctivitis because it usually clears up by itself and there's a very low risk of complications for untreated conjunctivitis.\nHowever, if the infection is particularly severe or it has lasted for more than 2 weeks, you may be prescribed antibiotics. Some schools or playgroups may insist that a child is treated with antibiotics before they can return, although this is rare.\nChloramphenicol and\u00a0fusidic acid are the two main types of antibiotics that may be prescribed.\nChloramphenicol is usually the first choice of antibiotic and comes in the form of eye drops. It's available without a prescription from pharmacies to treat bacterial conjunctivitis.\nChloramphenicol needs to be used carefully to get the best results, so make sure you follow the advice of your pharmacist about how and when to use it, or check the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication so you know how to use it properly.\nIf eye drops aren't suitable for you, you may be prescribed the antibiotic as an eye ointment instead.\nFusidic acid\u00a0may be prescribed if chloramphenicol isn't suitable for you. It's often better for children and elderly people because it doesn't need to be used as often. It's also the preferred treatment for pregnant women.\nLike\u00a0chloramphenicol, fusidic acid comes in the form of eye drops and should be used as advised by your doctor or as described in the instructions that come with the medication.\nEye drops can briefly cause\u00a0blurred\u00a0vision. Avoid driving or operating machinery straight after using eye drops.\nChloramphenicol and fusidic acid can also cause other side effects, such as a slight stinging or burning sensation in your eye, although this shouldn't last long.\nIt's very important to go back\u00a0to your optician if you still have symptoms after 2 weeks. You should also contact your optician immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:\n\neye pain\nsensitivity to light (photophobia)\nloss of vision\nintense redness in one eye or both eyes\n\nYour optician may recommend that you're tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some STIs, such as chlamydia, can cause infective conjunctivitis. If this is the case, your symptoms may last for several months.\nAllergic conjunctivitis\nYour treatment will depend on the type of allergic conjunctivitis you have.\nThe 4 main types of allergic conjunctivitis are:\n\nseasonal conjunctivitis \u2013 typically caused by an allergy to pollen\nperennial conjunctivitis \u2013 usually caused by an allergy to dust mites or pets\ncontact dermatoconjunctivitis \u2013 usually caused by an allergy to eye drops or cosmetics\ngiant papillary conjunctivitis \u2013 usually caused by an allergy to contact lenses\n\nWhatever the cause, you'll find that some self-help methods can ease your symptoms.\nIf you have allergic conjunctivitis, you can follow the guidelines below to treat your condition at home:\n\nif you wear contact lenses, take them out until all the signs and symptoms of the conjunctivitis have gone\ndon't rub your eyes, even though they may be itchy \u2013 rubbing your eyes can make your symptoms worse\nplace a cool compress over your eyes \u2013 wetting a flannel with cool water and holding it over your eyes will help ease your symptoms\navoid exposure to the allergen, if possible\n\nIf you have seasonal or perennial conjunctivitis, you may be prescribed the following medicines:\n\nantihistamines\u00a0\nmast cell stabilisers\ncorticosteroids\n\nIf allergic conjunctivitis needs rapid relief, your optician will probably prescribe a medicine known as an antihistamine.\nAntihistamines work by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it's under attack from an allergen. This prevents the symptoms of the allergic reaction occurring.\nYou may be prescribed antihistamine eye drops, such as:\n\nazelastine\u00a0(not suitable for children under four years of age)\nemedastine\u00a0(not suitable for children under three years of age)\nketotifen\u00a0(not suitable for children under three years of age)\nantazoline with xylometazoline (Otrivine-Antistin, not suitable for children under 12 years of age)\n\nAntazoline with xylometazoline (Otrivine-Antistin) is also available over the counter from pharmacies without prescription. Always follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nIf you're pregnant or breastfeeding, some antihistamine eye drops may not be suitable.\u00a0Speak to your\u00a0optician for advice. \u00a0\nYou may be prescribed an antihistamine such as:\n\ncetirizine\nfexofenadine\nloratadine\n\nYou'll usually only have to take an antihistamine once a day.\nIf possible, oral antihistamines shouldn't be taken if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Speak to your optician for advice.\nAlthough new antihistamines shouldn't make you drowsy, they may still have a sedating effect. This is\u00a0more likely if you take high doses or drink alcohol while you're taking antihistamines.\nMast cell stabilisers are an alternative type of medicine. Unlike antihistamines, they won't provide rapid symptom relief, but they are better at controlling your symptoms over a longer period of time.\nIt may take several weeks to feel the effects of a mast cell stabiliser, so you may also be prescribed an antihistamine to take at the same time.\nMast cell stabilisers that are commonly prescribed in the form of eye drops include:\n\nlodoxamide\nnedocromil sodium\nsodium cromoglicate\n\nIf your symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are particularly severe, you may be prescribed a short course of\u00a0topical corticosteroids (a cream, gel or ointment). However, these aren't usually prescribed unless absolutely necessary.\nGiant papillary conjunctivitis\nAs giant papillary conjunctivitis is usually caused by contact lenses, the symptoms often clear up after you stop wearing them. The spots that form on the inside of your upper eyelid may last slightly longer.\nIf you develop giant papillary conjunctivitis as a result of recent eye surgery, you'll be immediately referred to an ophthalmologist. This is so that your eyes can be carefully monitored and the most effective treatment given.\nIrritant conjunctivitis\nMost cases of irritant conjunctivitis don't need any treatment, as the condition should clear up once the irritant is removed from the eye.\nAn exception to this is if your eyes were exposed to harmful substances such as bleach or acid. This is usually regarded as a medical emergency and you'll need to be admitted to hospital so your eyes can be washed out with saline solution.\n\n\nComplications of conjunctivitis depend on whether the condition is an infection (infective conjunctivitis) or an allergic reaction (allergic conjunctivitis).\nInfective conjunctivitis\nIf\u00a0conjunctivitis has been caused by a\u00a0sexually transmitted infection (STI), particularly chlamydia, the infection may last several months, rather than weeks.\nInfective conjunctivitis caused by any type of bacteria can result in a number of complications, particularly in babies born prematurely (before week 37 of pregnancy).\nPossible complications include:\n\nmeningitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an infection of the meninges (the protective layer of cells surrounding the brain and spinal cord)\ncellulitis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the deep layer of skin and tissue that causes the skin on the surface to become sore and inflamed. It's usually easily treated with antibiotics\nsepticaemia \u2013 more commonly known as blood poisoning, septicaemia occurs when bacteria get into the bloodstream and attack the body's tissues\notitis media\u00a0\u2013 a short-term ear infection that affects around one in four children who have had infective conjunctivitis caused by the haemophilus influenzae bacteria\n\nNeonatal conjunctivitis\nIn newborn babies (neonates) up to 28 days old, infective conjunctivitis can lead to a severe and rapidly progressive eye infection. If this isn't treated, it can cause permanent damage to the child\u2019s vision.\nIf your newborn baby is found to have infective conjunctivitis, they'll immediately\u00a0be referred for specialist assessment and treatment. Their condition will be closely monitored. Complications of\u00a0infective conjunctivitis are rare and most babies make a full recovery.\nAfter having infective conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia, around\u00a01 in 5 babies may develop pneumonia. This is a potentially life-threatening condition in young babies and may need treatment in hospital.\nAllergic conjunctivitis\nIf your conjunctivitis is caused by\u00a0an allergic reaction to pollen, dust mites or similar (seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis), it's very rare to experience any serious complications.\nHowever, you may find your reoccurring symptoms frustrating. For example, if your conjunctivitis is caused by pollen, you may find it difficult to go outside during the spring and summer months without triggering your symptoms.\nThis type of allergic conjunctivitis can affect your daily life and could make it difficult for you to concentrate at work or school, particularly if your eyes are severely irritated. Although this can affect your quality of life, it shouldn't cause any long-term health problems.\u00a0\nPunctate epithelial keratitis\nSome types of conjunctivitis can cause a condition called keratitis. Keratitis is where your cornea (the front of your eye) becomes swollen.\nThis can be painful and make your eyes sensitive to light (photophobia). Ulcers sometimes form on the cornea. If the ulcers scar your cornea, your vision may be permanently damaged.\nIf you experience any unusual symptoms, contact your optician immediately or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Constipation is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It can mean that you're not passing stools regularly or you're unable to completely empty your bowel.\nConstipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as\u00a0unusually large or small.\nThe severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life.\nRead more about the symptoms of constipation.\nWhat causes constipation?\nIt's often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation.\u00a0However, there are a number of things that\u00a0contribute to the condition, including:\n\nnot eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals\na change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits\nignoring the urge to pass stools\nside effects of certain medications\nnot drinking enough fluids\nanxiety\u00a0or\u00a0depression\n\nIn children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training\u00a0can all\u00a0lead\u00a0to constipation.\nRead more about the causes of constipation.\nWho's affected\nConstipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It's estimated that around 1\u00a0in every 7\u00a0adults and up to 1\u00a0in every 3\u00a0children in the UK has constipation at any one time.\nThe condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy.\nWhen to get professional advice\nIf you have constipation you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory.\nConstipation isn't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.\nAlso speak to your pharmacist if you think your child might be constipated. Laxatives\u00a0are often recommended for children alongside diet and lifestyle changes.\nYou may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don't help and the problem continues, you should see your pharmacist.\nHowever, you should see your GP for advice if:\n\nyou notice any rectal bleeding\nyou notice any unexplained weight loss\nyou have persistent tiredness\nyour\u00a0constipation lasts longer than 14 days without improvement\n\nTreating constipation\nDiet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation.\nThis includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise.\nIf these aren't effective, your\u00a0pharmacist may recommend an oral\u00a0laxative medication\u00a0that can\u00a0help you empty your bowels.\nTreatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established.\nRead more about treating constipation.\nPreventing constipation\nMaking the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also\u00a0help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place.\nGiving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to\u00a0ignore the urge to go to the toilet.\nRead more about preventing constipation.\nComplications\nFor most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with\u00a0long-term constipation can develop:\n\nhaemorrhoids (piles)\nfaecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum)\nbowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools)\n\nRead more about the\u00a0complications of constipation.\n\n\nWhen you're constipated, passing stools becomes more difficult and less frequent than usual.\nNormal bowel habits vary from person to person. Some adults go to the toilet more than once a day, whereas others may only go every 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0days. Similarly, some infants pass stools several times a day, while others only pass them a few times a week.\nIf you or your child pass stools less than usual, it could be a sign of constipation.\nIt may also be more difficult to pass stools and you may feel unable to empty your bowel\u00a0completely. Your stools may appear dry, hard and lumpy, as well as abnormally large or small.\nOther symptoms of constipation can include:\n\nstomach ache and cramps\u00a0\nfeeling bloated\nfeeling\u00a0sick\nloss of appetite\n\nConstipation in children\nAs well as infrequent or irregular bowel movements, a child with constipation may also have any of the following symptoms:\n\nloss of appetite\na lack of energy\nbeing irritable, angry or unhappy\nfoul-smelling wind and stools\nstomach\u00a0pain and discomfort\nsoiling their clothes\ngenerally feeling unwell\n\n\n\nConstipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry.\nMost cases of constipation aren't caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. However, several factors can increase your chances of having constipation, including:\n\nnot eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals\na change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits\nhaving limited privacy when using the toilet\nignoring the urge to pass stools\nimmobility or lack of exercise\nnot drinking enough fluids\nhaving a high temperature (fever)\nbeing underweight or overweight\nanxiety\u00a0or\u00a0depression\npsychiatric problems, such as those brought on by sexual abuse, violence or trauma\n\nMedication\nConstipation may sometimes be a side effect of a medicine you're taking. Common types of medication that can cause constipation include:\n\naluminium\u00a0antacids (medicine to treat indigestion)\nantidepressants\u00a0\nantiepileptics (medicine to treat epilepsy)\nantipsychotics (medicine to treat\u00a0schizophrenia and other mental health conditions)\ncalcium\u00a0supplements\nopiate painkillers, such as codeine and morphine\ndiuretics (water tablets)\niron\u00a0supplements\n\nIf constipation is caused by medication, the condition will usually ease once you stop taking the medicine. However, you shouldn't stop taking any prescribed medication unless your GP advises you to.\nSpeak to your pharmacist if you have constipation that's caused by\u00a0a medicine. They may be able to\u00a0advise you on how to treat the problem, or they might recommend you see your GP for an alternative medicine if appropriate.\nPregnancy\nAbout 2\u00a0in every 5\u00a0women experience constipation during their pregnancy, mostly during the early stages.\nConstipation occurs during pregnancy because your body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant.\nThe bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. This is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. An increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along.\nIf you're pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Read more about treating constipation.\nOther conditions\nIn rare cases, constipation can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:\n\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\ndiabetes\nhypercalcaemia \u2013 where there's too much calcium in the bloodstream\nunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\nmuscular dystrophy\u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition that causes muscle wasting\nmultiple sclerosis\u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the nervous system\nParkinson's disease\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where part of the brain becomes progressively damaged, affecting the co-ordination of body movements\nspinal cord injury\nanal fissure\u00a0\u2013 a small tear or ulcer\u00a0in the skin\u00a0just inside the anus\ninflammatory bowel disease\u00a0\u2013 a condition that causes the intestines to become inflamed (irritated and swollen)\nbowel cancer\n\nBabies and children\nConstipation in babies and children is quite common. It's estimated that up to 1\u00a0in every 3\u00a0children in the UK has constipation at any time. Poor diet, fear about using the toilet and poor toilet training\u00a0can all be responsible.\nChildren who are over-fed are more likely to have constipation, as are those who don't get enough fluids. Babies who have too much milk are also more likely to get constipation. As with adults, it's very important that your child has enough fibre in their diet.\nIt's important that you don't make your child feel stressed or pressured about using the toilet. It's also important to let your children try things by themselves (when appropriate). Constantly intervening when they're using the toilet may make them feel anxious and may contribute to constipation.\nSome children can feel stressed or anxious about using the toilet. They may have a phobia about using the toilet, or feel they are unable to use the toilets at school.\nThis fear may be the result of your child experiencing pain when passing stools. This can lead to poor bowel habits, where children ignore the urge to pass stools and instead withhold them for fear of experiencing pain and discomfort. However, if they do this, their condition will only get worse.\nIn rare cases, constipation in babies and children can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as:\n\nHirschsprung's disease \u2013 which affects the bowel, making it difficult to pass stools\nanorectal malformation \u2013 where the baby's anus and rectum don't form properly\nspinal cord abnormalities \u2013 including rare conditions such as spina bifida and cerebral palsy\ncystic fibrosis \u2013 a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick and sticky mucus, which can lead to constipation\n\n\n\nConstipation is a very common condition. Your pharmacist won't usually need to carry out any tests or procedures, but will confirm a diagnosis based on your symptoms and medical history.\nYour pharmacist will ask you some questions about your bowel habits. Don't feel embarrassed about discussing this with your pharmacist. It's important they're aware of all of your symptoms, so they can make the correct diagnosis.\nYour pharmacist may also ask questions about your diet, level of exercise and whether there have been any recent changes to your routines.\nConstipation can be defined in a number of ways:\n\nopening the bowels less than 3\u00a0times a week\nneeding to strain to open your bowels on more than a quarter of occasions\npassing a hard or pellet-like stool on more than a quarter of occasions\n\nPhysical examination\nIf your pharmacist thinks you may have faecal impaction (when dry, hard stools collect in your rectum), they may advise you to contact your GP for a physical examination. See complications of constipation for more information about faecal impaction.\nA typical examination will begin with you lying on your back, while the GP feels your abdomen (tummy). You'll then lie on your side while your GP carries out a rectal examination using a lubricated, gloved finger. Your GP will be able to feel for any stools that may have collected.\nAn internal physical examination rarely needs to be carried out on a child. Instead, the diagnosis can usually be made by feeling the child's tummy.\nFurther tests\nIf you're experiencing severe symptoms, your doctor may request further tests, such as blood tests or thyroid tests, to diagnose or rule out other conditions.\nOther tests you may have include:\n\nan abdominal X-ray\u00a0\u2013 where X-ray\u00a0radiation is used to produce images of the inside of your abdomen\ntransit study examination \u2013 where you take a short course of special capsules that show up on X-rays; one or more X-rays are taken later on to see how long it takes for the capsules to pass through your digestive system\nanorectal manometry \u2013 where a small device with a balloon at one end is inserted into your rectum and\u00a0attached to a machine that measures pressure readings from the balloon as you squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles; this gives an idea of how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working\n\nAs there's an increased risk of bowel cancer in older adults, your doctor may also request tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, including a computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0or colonoscopy.\n\n\nTreatment for constipation depends on the cause, how long you've had it and how severe your symptoms are.\nIn many cases, it's possible to relieve the symptoms by making dietary and lifestyle changes.\nThe various treatments for\u00a0constipation\u00a0are outlined below.\u00a0\nLifestyle advice\nChanges to diet and lifestyle are often recommended as the first treatment for constipation. In many cases,\u00a0this will improve the condition\u00a0without the need for medication.\nSome self-help methods of treating constipation are listed below:\n\nIncrease your daily intake of fibre. You should eat at least 18-30g of fibre a day. High-fibre foods include plenty of fresh\u00a0fruit and vegetables and cereals.\nAdd some bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet. This will help to make your stools softer and easier to pass.\nAvoid\u00a0dehydration by drinking plenty of water.\nExercise more regularly\u00a0\u2013 for example,\u00a0by going for a daily\u00a0walk or run.\nIf constipation is causing pain or discomfort, you may want to take a painkiller, such as paracetamol. Always follow the dosage instructions carefully. Children under 16 shouldn't take aspirin.\nKeep to a routine (a place and time of day) when you're able to spend time on the toilet. Respond to your bowel's natural pattern: when you feel the urge, don't delay.\nTry resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet, so that your knees are above your hips; this can make passing stools easier.\u00a0\nIf medication you're taking\u00a0could be causing constipation, your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative.\n\nRead about\u00a0preventing constipation for more ways to change your diet and lifestyle.\nYour pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don't help.\nLaxatives\nLaxatives\u00a0are a type of medicine that help you pass stools. There are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system.\nYour pharmacist will usually start\u00a0you on\u00a0a bulk-forming laxative. These work by helping your stools to retain fluid. This means they're less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Bulk-forming laxatives also make your stools softer, which means they should be easier to pass.\nCommonly prescribed bulk-forming laxatives include ispaghula husk,\u00a0methylcellulose and sterculia. When taking this type of laxative, you must drink plenty of fluids, and don't take them before going to bed. It will usually be 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days before you feel the effects of a bulk-forming laxative.\nIf your stools remain hard after you've taken a bulk-forming laxative, your pharmacist may prescribe an osmotic laxative instead. Osmotic laxatives increase the amount of fluid in your bowels. This\u00a0softens your stools and stimulates your body to pass them.\nCommonly prescribed osmotic laxatives include\u00a0lactulose and macrogols. As with bulk-forming laxatives, make sure you drink enough fluids. It will usually be 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days before you feel the effect of the laxative.\nIf your stools are soft, but you still have difficulty passing them, your pharmacist may recommend a stimulant laxative. This type of laxative stimulates the muscles that line your digestive tract, helping them to move stools and waste products along your large intestine to your anus.\nThe most commonly prescribed stimulant laxatives are senna, bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate. These laxatives are usually only used on a short-term basis, and they start to work within 6 to 12 hours.\nAccording to your individual preference and\u00a0how quickly\u00a0you need\u00a0relief, your pharmacist may decide to combine different laxatives.\nHow long will I need to take laxatives for?\nIf you've had constipation for a short time, your pharmacist will usually advise you to stop taking the laxative once your stools are soft and easily passed.\nHowever, if your constipation\u00a0is caused by\u00a0an underlying medical condition or a medicine you're taking,\u00a0your GP may advise you to take laxatives for much longer, possibly many months or\u00a0even years.\nIf you've been taking laxatives for some time, you may have to gradually reduce your dose, rather than coming off them straight away. If you have been prescribed a combination of laxatives, you'll normally have to reduce the dosage of each laxative, one at a time, before you can stop taking them. This can take several months.\nYour GP will advise you about when it's best to stop taking long-term laxatives.\u00a0\nTreating faecal impaction\nFaecal impaction occurs when stools become hard and dry and collect in your rectum. This obstructs the rectum, making it more difficult for stools to pass along.\nSometimes as a result of impaction, overflow\u00a0diarrhoea may occur (where loose stools leak around the obstruction). You may have difficulty controlling this.\nIf you have faecal impaction, you'll initially be treated with a high dose of the osmotic laxative macrogol. After a few days of using macrogol, you may also have to start taking a stimulant laxative.\nIf you don't respond to these laxatives, and/or if you have overflow diarrhoea, you may need one of the medications described below.\n\nSuppository \u2013 this type of medicine is inserted into your anus. The suppository gradually dissolves at body temperature and is then absorbed into your bloodstream. Bisacodyl is an example of a medication that can be given in suppository form.\nMini enema \u2013 where a medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus and into your large bowel. Docusate and sodium citrate can be given in this way.\n\nPregnancy or breastfeeding\nIf you're pregnant, there are ways for you to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Your pharmacist will first advise you to change your diet by increasing fibre and fluid intake. You'll also be advised to do gentle exercise.\nIf dietary and lifestyle changes don't work, you may be prescribed a laxative to help you pass stools more regularly.\nLots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women to use because most aren't absorbed by the digestive system. This means that your baby won't feel the effects of the laxative.\nLaxatives that are safe to use during pregnancy include the osmotic laxatives lactulose and macrogols. If these don't work, your pharmacist may recommend taking a small dose of bisacodyl or senna (stimulant laxatives).\nHowever, senna may not be suitable if you're in your third trimester of pregnancy, because it's partially absorbed by your digestive system.\nRead more about constipation and other common pregnancy problems.\nBabies\u00a0who haven't been weaned\nIf your baby is constipated but hasn't started to eat solid foods, the first way to treat them is to give them extra water between their normal feeds. If you're using formula milk, make the formula as directed by the manufacturer and don't dilute the mixture.\nYou may want to try gently moving your baby's legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels.\nBabies who are eating solids\nIf your baby is eating solid foods, give them plenty of water or diluted fruit juice. Try to encourage them to eat fruit, which can be pur\u00e9ed or chopped, depending on their ability to chew. The best fruits for babies to eat to treat constipation are:\n\napples\napricots\ngrapes\npeaches\npears\nplums\nprunes\nraspberries\nstrawberries\n\nNever force your baby to eat food if they don't want to. If you do, it can turn mealtimes into a battle and your child may start to think of eating as a negative and stressful experience.\nIf your baby is still constipated after a change in diet, they may have to be prescribed a laxative. Bulk-forming laxatives aren't suitable for babies, so they'll usually be given an osmotic laxative. However, if this doesn't work, they can be prescribed a stimulant laxative.\nChildren\nFor\u00a0children, laxatives are often recommended alongside changes to diet. Osmotic laxatives are usually tried first, followed by a stimulant laxative if necessary.\nAs well as eating fruit, older children should have a healthy, balanced diet, which also contains vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta.\nTry to minimise stress or conflict associated with meal times or\u00a0using the toilet. It's important to be positive and encouraging when it comes to establishing a toilet routine. Allow your child\u00a0at least 10 minutes on the toilet, to make sure they've passed as many stools as possible.\nTo encourage a positive toilet routine, try making a diary of your child's bowel movements linked to a reward system. This can help them focus on using the toilet successfully.\n\n\nConstipation rarely causes any complications or long-term health problems. Treatment is usually effective, particularly if it's started promptly.\nHowever, if you have long-term (chronic) constipation, you may be more at risk of experiencing complications.\nRectal bleeding\nContinually straining to pass stools can cause pain, discomfort and rectal bleeding.\nIn some cases, bleeding is the result of a small tear around the anus (anal fissure), but it's more often caused by\u00a0haemorrhoids (piles). Piles are swollen blood vessels that form in the lower rectum and anus.\nAs well as bleeding, piles can also cause pain, itching around the anus, and swelling of the anus.\nThe\u00a0symptoms of piles often settle down after a few days without treatment. However, creams and ointments are available to reduce any itching or discomfort.\nSee your pharmacist as soon as possible if you experience any rectal bleeding.\nFaecal impaction\nLong-term constipation can increase the risk of faecal impaction, which\u00a0is where dried, hard stools collect in your rectum and anus.\nOnce you have faecal impaction, it's very unlikely that you'll be able to get rid of the stools naturally.\nFaecal impaction makes constipation worse because it's harder for stools and waste products to pass out of your anus, as the path is obstructed.\nFaecal impaction can sometimes lead to a number of other complications, including:\n\nswelling of the rectum\na loss of sensation in and around your anus\nbowel\u00a0incontinence\nbleeding from your anus\nrectal prolapse\u00a0\u2013 where part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your anus (this can also occur\u00a0as a result of\u00a0repeated straining in people with\u00a0chronic constipation)\n\nFaecal impaction is usually treated with laxative medication, although suppositories (medication inserted into the anus) and\u00a0mini enemas (where medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus) may sometimes be used.\n\n\nThere are a number of things you can do to prevent constipation, including making diet and lifestyle changes.\nFibre\nIncluding\u00a0enough fibre in your diet can significantly reduce your chances of developing constipation. Most adults don't eat enough fibre.\nYou should aim to have about 30g of fibre a day. You can increase your fibre intake by eating more:\n\nfruit and vegetables\nwholegrain rice\nwholewheat pasta\nwholemeal bread\nseeds and oats\n\nEating more fibre will keep your bowel movements regular, because it helps food pass through your digestive system more easily. Foods high in fibre also make you feel fuller for longer.\nIt's important to increase your fibre intake gradually, because a sudden increase may make you feel bloated. Suddenly increasing your intake of fibre may also cause you to produce more wind\u00a0(flatulence) and experience stomach cramps.\nRead more about\u00a0how to increase your intake of fibre and eating a healthy, balanced diet.\nFluids\nMake sure you drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, and steadily increase your intake when exercising or when it's hot. Try to cut back on the amount of caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks you consume.\nToilet habits\nNever ignore the urge to go to the toilet, because it can significantly increase your chances of having constipation.\nWhen going to the toilet, make sure you have enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably.\nExercise\nKeeping active and\u00a0mobile will greatly reduce your risk of getting constipation. You should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week.\nAs well as regular exercise reducing your risk of becoming constipated, it will also leave you feeling healthier and improve your mood, energy levels and general fitness.\nRead more about health and fitness\u00a0and physical activity guidelines for adults.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Croup is\u00a0a childhood condition that affects the windpipe (trachea), the airways to the lungs (the bronchi) and the voice box (larynx).\nChildren\u00a0with croup have a distinctive barking cough and\u00a0will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in.\nThey may also have a\u00a0hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked.\nRead more about the symptoms of croup\u00a0and diagnosing croup\nWhy does croup\u00a0happen?\nCommonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus.\nRead more about the causes of croup\nWho is affected by croup?\nCroup usually affects young children aged between six months and three years, with most cases occurring in one-year-olds.\u00a0\nHowever, croup can sometimes develop in babies as young as three months, and older children up to 15 years of age. Adults can also get croup but this is rare.\nThe condition is more common during the\u00a0late autumn and early winter months.\u00a0\nIt\u00a0tends to affect more boys than girls.\nA child may experience croup more than once during childhood.\nTreating croup\nMost cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important, because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.\nA\u00a0single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually also be prescribed to help reduce the swelling in the throat.\nIf your child has breathing problems they may need hospital treatment, such as adrenaline and oxygen through a mask.\nRead more about treating croup\nComplications\nMost\u00a0cases\u00a0of croup clear up within 48 hours. However, in some cases symptoms can last for up to\u00a0two\u00a0weeks.\nIt is extremely rare for a child to die from croup.\nThere are a number of conditions that\u00a0can follow\u00a0croup, such as\u00a0pneumonia and middle ear infection.\nRead more about the complications of\u00a0croup.\nPreventing croup\nCroup is spread in a similar way to the common cold, so it is difficult to prevent.\nGood hygiene is the main defence against croup, such as regularly washing hands and cleaning surfaces.\nA number of your child's routine vaccinations also protect against some of the infections that can cause croup. These include:\n\nMMR \u2013 protection from measles, mumps and rubella\nDTaP/IPV/Hib \u2013 protection from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b\n\n\n\nA child can get croup at any time of the year, although it's more likely to occur during\u00a0late autumn or early winter.\nThis may be because there are more viruses, such as colds and flu,\u00a0around at this time of year.\nTypical symptoms of croup include:\u00a0\n\na bark-like cough\na hoarse or croaky voice\ndifficulty breathing\na harsh grating sound when breathing in, called stridor\n\nStridor is often most noticeable when the child cries or coughs. But in more severe cases of croup it can also occur when the child is resting or sleeping.\nSymptoms tend to be worse at night.\nSome children have cold-like symptoms for a few days before developing croup symptoms.\nThese cold-like symptoms can include:\n\nsore throat\nrunny nose\ncough\u00a0\nhigh temperature (fever)\n\nAlthough croup symptoms usually only last for a few days, they can occasionally last up to two weeks.\u00a0\nWhen to seek medical advice\nCroup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and mild cases can be treated at home.\nYou should take them to your nearest hospital's accident and emergency department or dial 999 for an ambulance.\nSome of these symptoms may indicate a potentially life-threatening underlying condition called epiglottitis (inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis).\nThe symptoms could also indicate tracheitis (inflammation of the windpipe), which also requires immediate medical attention.\n\n\nCroup usually develops as the result of a viral infection. The infection causes the larynx (voice box) to become swollen and the trachea (windpipe) to become blocked, and may affect the tubes in the lungs (bronchi). It is sometimes called laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis\nParainfluenza virus\nThe parainfluenza virus is the most common cause of\u00a0croup.\u00a0Four strains of the virus are responsible for most croup cases. These are:\n\nparainfluenza I\nparainfluenza II\nparainfluenza III\nparainfluenza IV\n\nParainfluenza I is\u00a0responsible for most cases of croup.\nThe virus can be transmitted through close contact with infected people, as well as contaminated objects and surfaces. As with many airborne viruses, the parainfluenza virus is often spread by breathing in droplets from infected coughs or sneezes.\nOther viruses\nA\u00a0number of other viruses can also cause croup. These include:\n\ninfluenza A and B (flu viruses)\nthe measles virus, in children who have not been immunised against measles\nthe rhinovirus (common cold virus)\nenteroviruses\nthe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe breathing problems and pneumonia in babies\n\nOther\u00a0causes\nLess common causes of croup\u00a0include:\n\ninhaling a small object such as a peanut or a pen cap (inhaled foreign body)\nepiglottitis \u2013 inflammation of the epiglottis, (the flap at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the windpipe)\nan allergic reaction to substances such as pollen or dust mites\ninhalation of\u00a0irritants, such as chemicals\nacid leaking back out of the stomach and into the throat (acid reflux)\n\n\n\nA GP can diagnose croup\u00a0by studying\u00a0your child's symptoms, particularly\u00a0the sound of their cough. They\u00a0may also\u00a0check your child's temperature for a fever and ask whether they have recently had a cold or\u00a0viral infection.\nIn some cases, a pulse oximetry test may be carried out. This involves clipping a sensor onto your child's earlobe or finger to find out their oxygen levels.\nThe test does not hurt and should not distress your child, and determines whether your child is absorbing enough oxygen into their blood.\nYour GP will decide whether your child needs to be admitted to hospital or whether\u00a0their croup is safe to treat at home.\nYou should not try to check your child's throat yourself, because it could trigger a spasm (sudden narrowing) of the airway. This could cause the airway to swell even more, making breathing even more difficult.\nRuling out other conditions\nCroup can usually be diagnosed by studying your child\u2019s symptoms, but your GP may want to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.\nOther possible causes for your child\u2019s symptoms are:\n\nan abnormality of the airway, which has been present from birth\nan\u00a0abscess in the tissues in the back of the throat\ninhaled material (something they have breathed in)\nswelling of the deeper layers of the skin (angio-oedema)\nepiglottitis\ncongenital lesion\nan allergic reaction\n\nIn very rare cases, epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis) or tracheitis (inflammation of the windpipe) can cause similar symptoms to croup. In these cases, however, your child will usually feel very unwell generally, rather than just having the specific symptoms of croup.\nDifferentiating these causes from croup may require further tests.\nFurther investigation\nIf your child is admitted to hospital with severe croup, or if treatment\u00a0is\u00a0unsuccessful, further investigations may be needed to examine their neck and chest area for a possible obstruction.\nAn\u00a0X-ray may be recommended if it is thought your child may have inhaled something and it is obstructing their airway.\u00a0\n\n\nTreatment of croup depends on how severe the symptoms are. Most cases are mild and can be managed at home.\nHowever, if your child has severe croup, they will need to be admitted to hospital urgently.\nTreatment croup at home\nIf your GP\u00a0thinks your child has mild\u00a0croup, they will usually recommend\u00a0managing it\u00a0at home.\nThis\u00a0will often\u00a0involve using children's paracetamol\u00a0to ease any pain associated with the condition and may help lower your child's temperature if they have a fever.\nYou should also ensure your child is well hydrated by encouraging them to drink plenty of fluids.\nComforting your child is also\u00a0important because their symptoms may\u00a0get worse\u00a0if they are agitated or crying. If your child is distressed, sitting them upright on your lap will help to comfort and reassure them.\nYour GP will usually prescribe a single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone to help reduce swelling (inflammation) in your child's throat. Side effects of these medications can include restlessness, vomiting, upset stomach and headache.\nSteam treatment is not advised for the treatment of croup. There is no evidence that allowing your child to breathe in humid air, for example steam from a hot bath or shower in a closed room, will help.\nYou should seek urgent medical advice if you notice your child\u2019s symptoms getting worse.\nPainkillers for children\nPainkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, are available in liquid form for children.\u00a0You can get liquid paracetamol and ibuprofen over the counter from pharmacies and some supermarkets.\nChildren under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin.\nSpeak to your pharmacist or GP if you are unsure about what type of painkiller is suitable for your child.\nDo not use cough medicines or decongestants as these do not help ease the symptoms of croup.\u00a0These treatments often have drowsy side effects, which can be dangerous when a child\u00a0has breathing difficulties.\nHospital treatment\nIn severe cases of croup, treatment in hospital may be required.\nBreathing problems, such as shortness of breath, are a major symptom of severe croup.\nYou should dial 999 immediately for an ambulance if your child is struggling to breathe.\nIf your child has severe croup, they may be given adrenaline through a nebuliser. This will help improve symptoms within 10 to 30 minutes and the effects should last for up to two hours. A nebuliser allows your child to breathe the medication as a mist.\nIf your child is very distressed and finding it\u00a0difficult to breathe, they will be given oxygen through an oxygen mask.\nAs with milder cases of croup, oral dexamethasone or prednisolone\u00a0will usually\u00a0be given to help reduce any swelling in your child\u2019s airways.\nIn rare cases croup may require hospitalisation, where a child may need intubation. During intubation, a tube is inserted either through a nostril or the mouth and passed down into the windpipe. This will help your child breathe more easily.\nIntubation is usually performed under general anaesthetic. This means your child will be completely unconscious throughout the procedure so they do not experience pain or distress.\u00a0\n\n\nComplications that develop as a result of croup are rare.\nAirway obstruction\nIf an obstructed airway is not treated promptly, it can lead to:\n\nsevere breathing difficulty (respiratory distress)\nrespiratory arrest\u00a0(where breathing stops but the heart continues beating)\n\nAlways phone 999 for an ambulance if your child is struggling to breathe.\nYour child may find it difficult to drink fluids as a result of an obstruction in their airway. However, it is important they have plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.\nIf your child refuses fluids, try not to force them. This could distress your child and make the condition worse.\nSecondary infection\nA secondary infection can sometimes develop following the initial viral infection that caused croup. A secondary infection can potentially cause:\n\npneumonia, a chest infection which causes swelling of the tissue in one or both lungs\nbacterial tracheitis, which is\u00a0a serious and potentially life-threatening infection that can occur after a viral respiratory infection\n\nOther complications\nAlthough rare, other possible complications of croup can include middle ear infection and lymphadenitis, an infection of the glands of the immune system (lymph nodes).\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.\nIt\u00a0can cause problems with breathing and digestion from a young age.

It's estimated that 1 in every 2,500 babies born in the UK\u00a0has cystic fibrosis.\nA number of treatments are available to help reduce the problems caused by the condition,\u00a0but unfortunately average\u00a0life expectancy is reduced for people who have it.\nSymptoms of cystic fibrosis\nSymptoms of cystic fibrosis tend to start in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop very\u00a0soon after birth, or may not be obvious until adulthood.\nSome of the main symptoms of cystic fibrosis can include:\n\nrecurring\u00a0chest infections\ndifficulty putting on weight\nfrequent, wet-sounding\u00a0coughs\ndiarrhoea\noccasional wheezing and\u00a0shortness of breath\n\nPeople with the condition can also develop a number of related conditions, including diabetes,\u00a0thin, weakened bones (osteoporosis) and liver problems.\nRead more about the symptoms of cystic fibrosis\nCauses of cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both of their parents.\nThe faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways.\nTo be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit two copies of this faulty gene \u2013 one from each of their parents. Their parents will not usually have the condition themselves, because they will only carry one faulty gene and one that works normally.\nIf both parents carry the faulty gene, there's a 25% chance that each child they have will be born with cystic fibrosis.\nRead more about the causes of cystic fibrosis\nScreening and testing for cystic fibrosis\nMost cases of cystic fibrosis are now detected soon after birth through the\u00a0newborn blood spot test.\nThis involves collecting a drop of blood from the baby's heel and testing it for\u00a0abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis.\nMore tests\u00a0will be needed to confirm the diagnosis, such as:\n\na sweat test \u2013 to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal\na genetic test \u2013 where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis\n\nThese tests can also be carried out in older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who haven't been screened previously.\nIf you have a family history of cystic fibrosis, you can be tested to determine if you're at risk of having a child with the condition by checking if you're a\u00a0\"carrier\" of the faulty gene that causes it.\nRead more about how cystic fibrosis is diagnosed\nTreatments for cystic fibrosis\nThere's currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a number of treatments are available to help control the symptoms, prevent\u00a0complications, and make the condition easier to live with.\nPossible treatments include:\n\nantibiotics\u00a0to prevent and treat\u00a0chest infections\nmedicines\u00a0to\u00a0make the mucus in the lungs thinner and easier to cough up\nmedicines to widen the airways and reduce inflammation\nspecial techniques and devices to help clear mucus from the lungs\nmedicines that help the person absorb food better\nfollowing a special diet and taking supplements to prevent malnutrition\n\nA\u00a0lung transplant may eventually be needed if the lungs become greatly damaged.\nRead more about treating cystic fibrosis\nOutlook for cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis is a progressive condition, which means it tends to get worse over time.\nEventually the condition can be fatal if it leads to a serious infection or the lungs stop working properly.\nThe outlook for cystic fibrosis has improved considerably in recent years\u00a0because of\u00a0advancements in treatment, although most people with cystic fibrosis will have a shorter-than-average life expectancy.\nCurrently, about half of the people with cystic fibrosis will live past the age of 40. Children born with the condition nowadays are likely to live longer than this.\nIf you or your child has\u00a0cystic fibrosis, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child\u00a0on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

Read more about screening for\u00a0cystic fibrosis.\nThe main problems associated with cystic fibrosis are outlined below.\nLung problems\nCystic fibrosis can cause sticky mucus to clog the lungs and airways. This can cause:\n\nrecurring chest infections\u00a0\u2013 these occur because mucus in the lungs is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria\npersistent inflammation of the airways, which can cause them to become abnormally widened (bronchiectasis)\nincreased\u00a0coughing\noccasional wheezing and\u00a0shortness of breath\n\nOver time, the lungs can become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly.\nDigestive system problems\nThe mucus can also block parts of the digestive system, which\u00a0can affect how food travels through the gut and how it's\u00a0broken down or absorbed.\nThis can cause:\n\na serious bowel obstruction\u00a0in the first few days of life (meconium ileus)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this will often need an operation to remove the blockage\njaundice\ndiarrhoea or large, smelly stools\nproblems putting on weight and growing\u00a0\u2013 this can occur because the body\u00a0struggles to\u00a0digest and absorb nutrients (malnutrition)\ndiabetes from late childhood or early adulthood\u00a0\u2013 this can develop if the pancreas becomes severely damaged\n\nOther problems\nPeople with cystic fibrosis can also\u00a0experience a number of other problems, including:\n\nsinusitis\nnasal polyps\nthin,\u00a0weakened bones (osteoporosis)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can occur as a result of repeated infections, poor growth, lack of physical activity and malnutrition\nswelling and pain in the joints (arthritis or arthralgia) from late childhood\ndifficulty conceiving children \u2013 most men with cystic fibrosis are unable to have children naturally (although some fertility treatments may still work) because the tubes that carry sperm don't develop correctly; women can become pregnant, however\nliver problems caused by\u00a0the tiny bile ducts in the liver becoming blocked by mucus\nleaking of small amounts of urine, particularly during coughing fits (stress incontinence)\n\n\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both their parents.\nThe faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways \u2013 particularly the lungs and digestive system.\nThe condition is present from birth and cannot be caught from someone else who has it.\nHow cystic fibrosis is inherited\nGenes come in pairs. You inherit one set from your mother and one set from your father.\nTo be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both of their parents.\nThis can happen if\u00a0the parents are 'carriers' of the faulty gene. This means they don't have cystic fibrosis themselves, but they can have a child with the condition if their partner also carries the faulty gene.\nIt's estimated that around 1 in every 25 people in the UK are carriers of the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis.\nIf both parents are carriers, there's a:\n\n25% chance that each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won't have\u00a0cystic fibrosis\u00a0or be able to pass it on\n50% chance that each child they have will just inherit one copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier\n25% chance that each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have\u00a0cystic fibrosis\u00a0\n\nThis is known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n\nTests can be carried out to diagnose cystic fibrosis at any age.\nMost cases are now detected soon after birth through newborn screening, but older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who weren't screened can also have tests to check for the condition.\nTests to find out if you are a 'carrier' of the faulty gene responsible for\u00a0cystic fibrosis\u00a0may also be recommended for some people.\nNewborn screening\nA\u00a0newborn blood spot test is offered to all babies in Scotland to help detect problems early on, including cystic fibrosis.\nWhen your baby is five to eight days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to a laboratory to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis.\nYou should receive the results by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. You will be contacted sooner if a problem is found, and you'll be asked to attend a hospital appointment.\nThe screening result isn't 100% accurate, so more tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis.\nConfirming\u00a0a diagnosis\nTests to confirm a diagnosis will be carried out if screening suggests that your child may have cystic fibrosis, or your doctor thinks you could have the condition and you haven't been screened previously.\nTwo main tests can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis:\n\nsweat test \u2013 a test to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal\ngenetic test \u2013 where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis\n\nThe sweat test is most commonly used, although\u00a0genetic testing may be done if the sweat test result is inconclusive or to identify the specific genetic fault that's causing the condition.\nCarrier testing\nTesting to\u00a0find out if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis may be useful if:\n\nyou\u00a0have a close relative, such as a child, sibling or parent,\u00a0who's a known carrier\nyou\u00a0have a close relative\u00a0with cystic fibrosis\nyour partner is known to carry the\u00a0cystic fibrosis gene\n\nThis can be done using a blood test, or occasionally a special mouthwash, to collect a sample of cells. The sample is then sent to a laboratory so it can be checked for the faulty gene.\nFinding out whether you're a carrier of the faulty gene can help determine if you're at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis.\u00a0A genetic counsellor\u00a0will explain the results of the test\u00a0to you and discuss the implications and options available for\u00a0future pregnancies.\n\n\nThere's currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but it's possible to help control the symptoms, prevent or reduce complications, and make the condition easier to live with.\nA person with cystic fibrosis will be supported by a\u00a0team of healthcare professionals at a specialist cystic fibrosis centre. A care plan will be drawn up that's tailored to their individual needs.\nA range of treatments may be\u00a0used and sometimes treatment in hospital will be needed. Regular appointments to monitor the condition will also be recommended.\nSome of the main treatments for cystic fibrosis include:\nMedications for lung problems\nPeople with cystic fibrosis may need to take a number of different medicines to treat and prevent lung problems. These may be swallowed, inhaled or injected.\nSome of the main medicines for cystic fibrosis are:\n\nantibiotics to prevent and treat\u00a0chest infections\nmedicines to make the sticky mucus in the lungs thinner, such as dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and mannitol dry powder\na medicine called ivacaftor to help reduce the levels of mucus in the body \u2013 although this is only suitable for fewer than 1 in every 20 people (4%) with cystic fibrosis\nbronchodilators to widen the airways and help make breathing easier\nsteroid medication to treat\u00a0nasal polyps\u00a0(small growths inside the nose)\n\nIt's also\u00a0important that people with cystic fibrosis are up to date with all routine vaccinations and have the\u00a0flu jab\u00a0each year once they're old enough.\nAirway clearance techniques\nIn addition to medication, special techniques can be used to help keep the lungs and airways clear. A physiotherpist\u00a0can give you advice.\nSome of the main techniques include:\n\nactive cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) \u2013 a technique that involves a sequence of relaxed breathing, followed by deep breathing exercises and then huffing\nautogenic drainage \u2013 a series of gentle breathing techniques that clear mucus from the lungs\nmodified postural drainage \u2013 a technique that involves changing your position to make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs\nairway clearance devices \u2013 handheld devices that use vibration and air pressure to help remove mucus from your airways; you may have to pay in the region of \u00a345-60 for one of these devices\n\nYour care team can provide more information on the techniques mentioned above.\u00a0\nDietary and nutritional advice\nFor people with cystic fibrosis, getting the right nutrition is vital in helping them develop normally and stopping them becoming frequently ill.\nHowever, the majority of people with cystic fibrosis cannot digest food and absorb nutrients from when they're a baby. Occasionally, the condition can cause the pancreas to become damaged over time, causing the same problem.\nA dietitian will advise on what you can do to help avoid malnutrition. They may recommend:\n\ntaking digestive enzyme capsules with all meals and snacks to help with digestion \u2013 the number of capsules needed depends on the food being eaten and varies from person to person\nfollowing a special balanced diet that's high in calories (energy), fat and protein\ntaking\u00a0vitamin and mineral supplements\n\nLung transplants\nIn severe cases of cystic fibrosis, when the lungs stop working properly and all medical treatments have failed to help, a lung transplant may be recommended.\nA lung transplant is a serious operation that carries risks, but it can greatly improve the length and quality of life for people with severe cystic fibrosis.\nThe outlook for people with cystic fibrosis is often better than for many transplant patients, as they're often younger and in better general health. It's\u00a0estimated that up to 9 out of 10 people will survive for at least a year after a transplant.\nThe Cystic Fibrosis Trust has information on lung transplants in cystic fibrosis.\nTreatments for associated problems\nPeople with cystic fibrosis can have a number of other problems that may benefit from treatment.\nFor example:\n\nexercise can help keep bones and joints healthy, and is recommended for everyone with\u00a0cystic fibrosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0any sport or exercise is usually good, but if you're not sure about a particular activity, you should ask your physiotherapist for advice\nmedicines called bisphosphonates can help treat weak and brittle bones that may occur as a result of cystic fibrosis if the person doesn't get enough\u00a0vitaminD and calcium\u00a0(from their diet and/or from supplements)\ninsulin medication and a special diet may help someone with diabetes caused by\u00a0cystic fibrosis control their blood sugar levels\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder, usually caused by a bladder infection.\nIt's a\u00a0common type of\u00a0urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly in women, and is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern.

These should start to have an effect within a day or two.\nIf you've had cystitis before and don't feel you need to see your pharmacist or GP, you may want to treat your symptoms at home.\nUntil you're feeling better, it may help to:\n\ntake\u00a0paracetamol or\u00a0ibuprofen\ndrink plenty of water\nhold a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs\navoid having sex\n\nSome people find it helpful to try over-the-counter\u00a0products that reduce the acidity of their urine (such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate), but there's a lack of evidence to suggest they're effective.\nIf you keep getting cystitis, your GP may give you an antibiotic prescription to take to a pharmacy whenever you develop symptoms, without needing to see your\u00a0doctor first. Your GP can also prescribe a low dose of antibiotics for you to take continuously over several months if necessary.\nRead more about treating cystitis\nPreventing cystitis\nIf you get cystitis frequently, there are some things you can try that may stop it coming back. However, it's not clear how effective most of these measures are.\nThese measures include:\n\nnot using perfumed bubble bath, soap or talcum powder around your genitals \u2013 use plain, unperfumed varieties\nhaving a shower, rather than a bath \u2013 this\u00a0avoids exposing your genitals to the chemicals in your cleaning products for too long\ngoing to the toilet as soon as you need to pee and\u00a0always emptying your bladder fully\nstaying well hydrated \u2013\u00a0drinking plenty of fluids may help to stop bacteria\u00a0multiplying in your bladder\u00a0\nalways wiping your bottom from front to back when you go to the toilet\nemptying your bladder as soon as possible after having sex\ncontraception instead\nwearing underwear made from cotton, rather than synthetic material such as nylon, and\u00a0not wearing tight jeans and trousers\n\nDrinking cranberry juice has traditionally been recommended as a way of\u00a0reducing your chances of getting cystitis. However,\u00a0large studies have suggested it doesn't make a significant difference.\n\n\nCystitis can cause problems with peeing and make you feel unwell.\nSymptoms of cystitis in adults\nCystitis in adults can cause:\n\npain, burning or stinging\u00a0when you pee\nneeding to pee more often and urgently than normal\nfeeling like you need to pee again\u00a0soon after going to the toilet\nurine that's dark, cloudy or strong-smelling\npain low down in your tummy\nfeeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired\nblood in your urine\n\nIn adults, cystitis doesn't usually cause a high temperature (fever). If you have a temperature\u00a0of 38C (100.4F) or above and pain in your lower back or sides, it may be a sign of a kidney infection.\nSymptoms of cystitis in children\nIt can be difficult to tell whether a child has cystitis, because the symptoms can be vague and young children cannot easily communicate how they feel.\nPossible symptoms of cystitis in young children may include:\n\na\u00a0high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\nweakness and tiredness\nirritability\u00a0\nreduced appetite\nvomiting\n\nChildren\u00a0with cystitis can sometimes also have symptoms usually found in adults, such as\u00a0pain when\u00a0peeing, peeing more often than normal and pain in their tummy.\nWhen to see\u00a0your GP\u00a0\nYou should see your GP if you or your child have symptoms of cystitis for the first time.\nCystitis isn't usually a cause for serious concern, but the\u00a0symptoms can\u00a0be similar to several other conditions, so\u00a0it's important to get a proper diagnosis.\nIf you're a woman who has had cystitis before, you don't necessarily need to see your GP again. Cystitis is very common in women and mild cases often get better on their own. Speak to a pharmacist if you need any advice about treating cystitis.\nHowever, you should see your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to get better in a few days, you get cystitis frequently,\u00a0or you're pregnant.\nChildren and men should always be seen by a GP if they\u00a0have symptoms of cystitis, as the condition is less common and could be more serious in these groups.\n\n\nCystitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection, although it sometimes happens when the bladder is irritated or damaged for another reason.\nBacterial infections\nMost\u00a0infections are thought to\u00a0occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body) and start to multiply.\nCystitis is much more common in women than men, probably because the anus (back passage) is closer to the urethra in women and the urethra is much shorter.\nIt's not always obvious how the bacteria get into the bladder, but it can be caused by:\n\nhaving sex\nwiping your bottom after\u00a0going to the toilet\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you wipe from back to front\ninserting a tampon or\u00a0urinary catheter (a thin tube inserted into the urethra to drain the bladder)\nusing a\u00a0diaphragm for contraception\n\nWhat can increase your\u00a0risk?\nThere are a number of things that can increase your chances of developing an infection in your bladder. Some of these are outlined below.\nIf you're unable to empty your bladder fully, any bacteria that get inside may not be flushed out when you\u00a0go to the toilet\u00a0and can multiply more easily.\nYou may not be able to empty your bladder fully if:\n\nyou have a blockage in your urinary system, such as a bladder stone\nyou're pregnant, as the\u00a0baby may be pressing on your bladder\n(in men) you have an\u00a0enlarged prostate gland that presses on the urethra\n\nFor women who\u00a0have been through the\u00a0menopause, or are going through it, the lining of the urethra can shrink and become thinner because of\u00a0a lack of the hormone oestrogen.\nThe natural balance of bacteria in the vagina\u00a0may also change, which can allow potentially harmful bacteria to become more common.\nThis\u00a0can make the urethra more vulnerable to infection, which could spread into the bladder.\nYou're more likely to get cystitis if you have\u00a0diabetes \u2013 a condition where the level of sugar in your body becomes too high.\nHigh levels of sugar in your urine can provide a good environment for bacteria to multiply, so any bacteria that get into the bladder are more likely to cause cystitis.\nOther causes of cystitis\nCystitis can also be caused by damage or irritation to the urethra and bladder.\nThis can be the result of:\n\nfriction from sex\nchemical irritants, such as those in perfumed soap or bubble bath\ndamage caused by a\u00a0catheter or surgery on your bladder\nradiotherapy to your pelvis or treatment with certain chemotherapy medicines\na\u00a0woman's genitals\u00a0having been\u00a0deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons (an illegal practice called female genital mutilation or FGM)\n\nCystitis has also been linked to recreational use of the drug ketamine.\n\n\nMild cystitis will usually clear up on its own within a few days, although sometimes you may need to take antibiotics.\nSee your GP for advice and treatment if:\n\nyou have\u00a0symptoms of cystitis\u00a0for the first time\nyour symptoms\u00a0don't start to improve within a few days\nyou get cystitis frequently\nyou have severe symptoms, such as blood in your urine\nyou're pregnant and have symptoms of cystitis\nyou're a man and have symptoms of cystitis\nyour child has symptoms of cystitis\n\nWomen who have had cystitis before don't necessarily need to see their GP if the condition returns, as\u00a0mild cases often\u00a0get better without antibiotics. You can try the self-help measures below or ask your pharmacist for advice.\nThings you can try yourself\nIf you've had cystitis before and don't\u00a0feel you need to see your GP, the following advice may help to relieve your symptoms until the condition clears up:\n\ntake over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen\u00a0\u2013\u00a0always read the medicine information leaflet beforehand to check whether you can take it, and check with your pharmacist if you're not sure\ndrink plenty of water \u2013 it's been suggested this may help flush the infection out of your bladder and some people find it helpful, although it's not clear how effective it actually is\nuse a hot water bottle \u2013 holding a hot water bottle on your tummy or between your thighs may reduce any discomfort\ndon't have sex until you're feeling better, because\u00a0it may make the condition worse\n\nSome people find drinking cranberry juice or using products that reduce the acidity of their urine (such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium citrate) reduce their symptoms, but there's a lack of evidence to suggest they're effective.\nThese products are also not suitable for everyone. Check with your GP or pharmacist before trying them\u00a0if you're taking any other medication.\nAntibiotics\nIn some cases, your GP may prescribe a\u00a0course of antibiotics. This will usually involve taking a tablet\u00a0or capsule two to\u00a0four\u00a0times a day for three days.\nAntibiotics should start to have an effect quite quickly. Return to your GP if your symptoms haven't started to improve within a few days.\nMost people won't have any side effects from antibiotic treatment, but possible side effects can include feeling or being sick, itching, a rash and diarrhoea.\nIf\u00a0cystitis keeps coming back\nIf you keep getting cystitis (known as recurrent\u00a0cystitis) your doctor may prescribe stand-by antibiotics or continuous antibiotics.\nA stand-by antibiotic is a prescription you can take to\u00a0a pharmacy the next time you have symptoms of\u00a0cystitis, without needing to visit your GP first.\nContinuous antibiotics are taken for several months to prevent further episodes of cystitis. These may be prescribed:\n\nif cystitis usually occurs after having sex \u2013 you may be given a prescription for antibiotics to take within two hours of having sex\nif cystitis is not related to having sex \u2013 you may be given a low-dose antibiotic to take for a trial period of six months\n\nYour doctor may also recommend some measures you can take to prevent cystitis, although it's not clear how effective these are.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Deafblindness is a combination of sight and hearing loss that affects a person's ability to communicate, access information and get around.\nIt's also sometimes called \"dual sensory loss\" or \"multi-sensory impairment\".\nA deafblind person won't usually be totally deaf and totally blind, but both senses will be reduced enough to cause significant difficulties in everyday life.\nThese problems\u00a0can occur even\u00a0if\u00a0hearing loss and\u00a0vision loss are mild, as the two senses work together and one would usually help compensate for loss of the other.\nSigns of deafblindness\nDeafblindness most commonly affects older adults, although it can affect people of all ages, including babies and young children.\nIn older people, it may develop gradually and the person themselves may not realise their vision and/or hearing is getting worse at first.\nSigns of a problem\u00a0can include:\n\nneeding to turn up the volume on the television or radio\ndifficulty following a conversation\nnot hearing noises\u00a0such as a knock at the door\nasking others to speak loudly, slowly and more clearly\nneeding to hold books or newspapers very\u00a0close, or sitting close to the television\ndifficulty moving around unfamiliar places\n\nIf someone already has either a hearing or vision problem, it's important to look out for signs that suggest the other sense may be getting worse too.\nRead more about the symptoms of deafblindness\nSeeing your GP\nVisit your GP if you think your hearing and/or eyesight may be getting worse.\nIf you're worried about a friend or family member, encourage them to speak to their GP.\nIt's best to seek advice as soon as possible, as treatment for some underlying causes of deafblindness (see below) can be more effective if started early.\u00a0Early diagnosis will also ensure the person is able to access local support services sooner.\nRead more about diagnosing and assessing deafblindness\nWhat causes deafblindness?\nThere are many potential causes of deafblindness.

The condition can either be present at birth or develop later in life.\nDeafblindness\u00a0from birth\nDeafblindness from birth is known as congenital deafblindness.\nIt can be caused by:\n\nproblems associated with\u00a0premature birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy)\nan infection picked up during pregnancy, such as\u00a0rubella (German measles),\u00a0toxoplasmosis or\u00a0cytomegalovirus (CMV)\ngenetic conditions, such as\u00a0CHARGE syndrome\u00a0or Down's syndrome\ncerebral palsy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination\nfoetal alcohol syndrome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0health problems caused by drinking alcohol in pregnancy\n\nDeafblindness\u00a0later in life\nIn most cases, deafblindness develops later in life. This is known as acquired deafblindness.\nA person\u00a0with acquired deafblindness\u00a0may be\u00a0born without a hearing or sight\u00a0problem and then later loses part or all of both senses. Alternatively, someone may be born with either a hearing or vision problem,\u00a0and then later loses part or all of the other sense later on.\nProblems that can\u00a0contribute to\u00a0acquired deafblindness include:\n\nage-related\u00a0hearing loss\nUsher syndrome \u2013 a genetic condition that affects hearing, vision and balance\neye problems associated with\u00a0increasing age, such as\u00a0age-related macular degeneration (AMD),\u00a0cataracts and\u00a0glaucoma\ndiabetic retinopathy\u00a0\u2013 a complication of diabetes where the cells\u00a0lining the back of the eye\u00a0are damaged by high blood sugar levels\ndamage to the brain, such as from meningitis, encephalitis, a\u00a0stroke or\u00a0severe head injury\n\n\nSense:\u00a0Deafblindness causes and associated conditions\nSense:\u00a0A-Z of deafblindness causes\n\n\n\nDeafblindness may be detected soon after a baby is born, or after tests carried out later in life.\nSpeak to your GP if you have any concerns about your or your child's hearing and/or vision at any point.\nIf you're worried about a family member or friend, try to encourage them to speak to their GP.\nNewborn screening\nIf\u00a0your baby is born deafblind, this will usually be picked up during newborn screening.\nThese are a series of checks carried out to\u00a0see if your baby has any serious health problems from birth, including any problems with their eyes or hearing.\nIf no problems are picked up at this stage, they may be detected during routine checks as your child gets older.\nHearing and vision tests for adults\nIn most cases, deafblindness\u00a0develops as a person gets older. It can happen gradually, so you may not notice that your vision and/or hearing are getting worse at first.\nIt's therefore important to have routine eye tests to check for any problems. Adults should normally have their eyes tested every two years.\nYou can request a hearing test at your GP surgery at any point if you think you may be losing your hearing.\nA person\u00a0may be diagnosed with deafblindness if\u00a0tests show they have\u00a0both hearing and vision problems.\nTheir\u00a0hearing and vision should continue to be regularly assessed\u00a0even after they've been diagnosed, as the level of care and support\u00a0they need will depend on how severely each sense is affected.\nSearch for your local optician using Scotland's Service Directory.\nSpecialist assessment\nAs soon as deafblindness has been identified, a specialist assessment should be arranged by\u00a0the local authority.\nThe assessment\u00a0should only be carried out by a specially trained professional who\u00a0is able to identify the deafblind person's abilities and\u00a0needs.\u00a0The assessment should include assessing their\u00a0needs in relation to:\n\ncommunication\none-to-one human contact\nsocial interaction\nemotional wellbeing\nsupport with mobility\nassistive technology\nrehabilitation\n\nThe assessment will also take\u00a0into account the person's current needs and those that develop in the future.\nA deafblind person should have access to services suitable to their level of hearing and sight and their individual needs.

The level of care and support they need will depend on\u00a0how severe their hearing and vision problems are.\nIndividual care plan\nThe individual abilities and needs of a deafblind person should be assessed soon after they're diagnosed. This will allow a tailored care plan to be drawn up.\nThe care plan will aim to:\n\npreserve and maximise any remaining sensory functions the person has\nteach alternative communication methods such as the deafblind manual alphabet (see below)\nhelp the person retain as much independence as possible \u2013 for example, by recommending they receive training to use a long cane or guide dog or through the provision of a communicator guide\nfor young children,\u00a0ensure their educational needs are met\n\nSome of the\u00a0main services, techniques and treatments\u00a0that may be recommended as part of a care plan are outlined below.\n\nSense:\u00a0Legal rights:\u00a0social care, education and benefits\nSense:\u00a0Early support for your child\n\nCommunication systems\nAs deafblindness can make communicating by speech and writing difficult, alternative forms of communication may be necessary.\nThe main communication systems\u00a0used by deafblind people include:\n\nclear speech \u2013 speaking clearly is one of the most effective and common ways of communicating with deafblind people who have some remaining vision and hearing\ndeafblind manual alphabet \u2013\u00a0a tactile form of communication where words are spelt onto the deafblind person's hand using set positions and movements\nblock alphabet \u2013 a simple tactile form of communication where a word is spelt out in capital letters that are drawn onto the deafblind person's palm\nhands-on signing \u2013 an adapted version of British Sign Language (BSL)\u00a0where\u00a0the deafblind person feels what's being signed by placing their hands on top of the signer's hand\nvisual frame signing \u2013 an adapted version of BSL where\u00a0the signs are adapted to be signed in a smaller space to match the position and size of a deafblind person's remaining sight\nbraille \u2013 a system that uses\u00a0a series of raised dots to represent letters or groups of letters\nmoon \u2013\u00a0similar to Braille, but uses raised, adapted capital letters that are simpler to feel\n\n\nSense:\u00a0Methods of communicating with people who are deafblind\nSense:\u00a0Quick tips for communicating with people who are deafblind\n\nVision aids\nFor some\u00a0deafblind people, it may be possible to improve vision using low vision aids, such as glasses, magnifying lenses and task lights.\nSpecially designed items, such as telephones and keyboards, may also help someone who is visually impaired.\nThe\u00a0Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)\u00a0has more information about everyday living with vision loss,\u00a0including advice about the technology available\u00a0to help with everyday tasks.\nMany libraries stock a selection of large-print books and 'talking books', where the text is read aloud and recorded onto a CD.

There are various hearing aid styles available to suit different types of hearing loss and personal preference.\nHearing aids use microphones to collect the sound from the environment, amplify it and deliver it into the ear canal of the wearer so that it can be processed by the auditory system. An audiologist (hearing specialist) will be able to recommend the most suitable type of aid after testing your hearing.\nFor some people, hearing aids that deliver the sound into the ear canal are not appropriate. In these cases, hearing may be improved using a surgically implanted hearing system, such as a cochlea implant or bone conducting hearing implant.\nWhile these still use a microphone to collect the sound initially, they then covert that sound into either an electrical signal or vibration, passing it to the inner or middle ear for processing by the auditory system.\n\nSense:\u00a0Hearing technologies\nAction on Hearing Loss:\u00a0Hearing aids\n\nOne-to-one support\nEvery deafblind person is entitled to help from a\u00a0specially trained one-to-one support worker if they need it.\nDepending on the person's situation, this may be a:\n\ncommunicator guide \u2013\u00a0someone who works with people who have become deafblind later in life, to offer the support the person needs to live independently\ninterpreter \u2013\u00a0someone who acts as a communication link between the deafblind person and other people, using the deafblind person's preferred method of communication\nintervenor \u2013\u00a0someone who\u00a0works with\u00a0children and adults who were born deafblind, to help them experience and join in the world around them as much as possible\n\n\nSense:\u00a0Communicator guides\nSense:\u00a0Intervenors\n\nTreating underlying\u00a0conditions\nSome conditions that affect hearing and vision can be treated using medication or surgery.

It can also occur in the pelvis or abdomen.\nIt can cause pain and\u00a0swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.\u00a0\nDVT and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE).\nDVT symptoms\nIn some cases, there may be no\u00a0symptoms of DVT. If symptoms do occur they can include:\n\npain, swelling and tenderness in one of\u00a0your legs (usually your calf or thigh)\na heavy ache in the affected area\nwarm skin in the area of the clot\nred skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee\n\nDVT usually (although not always)\u00a0affects one\u00a0leg. The pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee.\nPulmonary embolism\nThis is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream. This then blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs, preventing blood from reaching them.\nIf\u00a0left untreated, about 1\u00a0in 10 people with a DVT will develop a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition which causes:\n\nbreathlessness\u00a0\u2013 which may come on gradually or suddenly\nchest pain\u00a0\u2013 which may become worse when you breathe in\nsudden collapse\u00a0\n\nBoth DVT and pulmonary embolism\u00a0need urgent investigation and treatment.\nSeek immediate medical attention if you have pain, swelling and tenderness in your leg and develop breathlessness and chest pain.\nRead more about the\u00a0complications of DVT\nDVT causes\nEach year,\u00a0DVT affects around 1\u00a0person in every 1,000 in the UK.\nAnyone can develop\u00a0DVT, but\u00a0it becomes more common over the age of 40. As well as age, there are also\u00a0some other risk factors, including:\n\nhaving a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism\nhaving a family history of blood clots\nbeing inactive for long periods\u00a0\u2013 such as after an operation or during a long journey\nblood vessel damage\u00a0\u2013 a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clot\nhaving certain\u00a0conditions or treatments\u00a0that cause your blood to clot more easily than normal\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as cancer (including\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0and\u00a0radiotherapy\u00a0treatment), heart and lung disease, thrombophilia and Hughes syndrome\nbeing pregnant\u00a0\u2013 your blood also clots more easily during pregnancy\nbeing overweight or\u00a0obese\n\nThe\u00a0combined contraceptive pill\u00a0and\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\u00a0both contain the female hormone oestrogen, which causes the blood to clot more easily. If you're taking either of these, your risk of developing DVT is\u00a0slightly increased.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of DVT\nDiagnosing DVT\nSee your GP as soon as possible if\u00a0you think you may have DVT\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg.\u00a0They'll ask you about your\u00a0symptoms and medical history.\nIt\u00a0can be\u00a0difficult to diagnose DVT from symptoms alone. Your GP may advise that you have a specialised\u00a0blood test\u00a0called a D-dimer test.\nThis test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream. The larger the number of fragments found, the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein.\nHowever, the D-dimer test isn't always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation, injury or during pregnancy. Additional tests, such as\u00a0an ultrasound scan, will need to be carried out to confirm DVT.\nAn\u00a0ultrasound scan\u00a0can be used to detect clots in your veins. A special type of ultrasound called a Doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel. This helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked, which could be caused by a blood clot.\nA venogram may be used if the results of a D-dimer test and ultrasound scan can't confirm a diagnosis of DVT.\nDuring a venogram, a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot. The dye travels up\u00a0the leg and can be detected by\u00a0X-ray, which will highlight\u00a0a gap in\u00a0the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood.\nDVT treatment\nTreatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines. These reduce the blood's ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger.\nHeparin and\u00a0warfarin\u00a0are 2 types of anticoagulant often used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming.\nA number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), may also be used to treat conditions such as DVT. These medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they've been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects.\nYou'll also be prescribed compression stockings to wear every day, which will improve your symptoms and help prevent complications.\nRead more\u00a0about treating DVT\nDVT prevention\nIf you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you're there.\nIf you're at risk of developing DVT, there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring, both before you go into hospital. These include temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill,\u00a0and while you're in hospital, such as wearing compression stockings.\nWhen you leave hospital, your care team may also make some recommendations to help prevent DVT returning or complications developing. These may include:\n\nnot smoking\neating a healthy, balanced diet\ntaking regular exercise\u00a0\nmaintaining a healthy weight or\u00a0losing weight if you're\u00a0obese\n\nThere's no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing DVT.\nSee your GP before embarking on long-distance travel if you're at risk of getting a DVT, or if you've had a DVT in the past.\nWhen taking a long-distance journey\u00a0(6 hours or more) by plane, train or car, you should take steps to avoid getting DVT. Drink plenty of\u00a0water, perform simple leg exercises and take regular, short walking breaks.\nRead more about\u00a0preventing DVT\n\n\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) sometimes occurs for no apparent reason.\nHowever, the risk of developing DVT is increased in certain circumstances.\nInactivity\u00a0\nWhen you're inactive your blood tends to collect in the lower parts of your body, often in your lower legs. This is usually nothing to worry about because when you start to move, your blood flow increases and moves evenly around your body.\nHowever, if you're unable to move for a long period of time\u00a0\u2013 such as after an operation, because of\u00a0an illness or injury, or during a long journey\u00a0\u2013\u00a0your blood flow can slow down considerably. A slow blood flow increases the chances of a\u00a0blood clot\u00a0forming.\nIn hospital\nIf you have to go into hospital for an operation or procedure, your risk of getting a blood clot increases. This is\u00a0because DVT is more likely to occur when you're unwell or inactive, or less active than usual.\nAs a patient, your risk of developing DVT depends on\u00a0the type of treatment you're having. You may be at increased risk of DVT if any of the following apply:\n\nyou're having an operation that takes longer than 90 minutes, or 60 minutes if the operation is on your leg, hip or abdomen\nyou're having an operation for an inflammatory or abdominal condition, such as\u00a0appendicitis\nyou're confined to a bed, unable to walk, or spending a large part of the day in a bed or chair for at least three days\n\nYou may also be at increased risk of DVT if you're much less active than usual because of an operation or serious injury and have other DVT risk factors, such as a family history of the condition.\nWhen you're admitted to hospital you'll be assessed for your risk of developing a blood clot and, if necessary, given preventative treatment.\nBlood vessel damage\nIf the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, it may become narrowed or blocked, which can cause a blood clot to form.\nBlood vessels can be damaged by injuries such as broken bones or severe muscle damage. Sometimes, blood vessel damage that occurs during surgery can cause a blood clot, particularly in operations on the lower half of your body.\nConditions such as\u00a0vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels),\u00a0varicose veins and some forms of medication, such as chemotherapy,\u00a0can also damage blood vessels.\nMedical and genetic conditions\nYour risk of getting DVT is increased if you have a condition that causes your blood to clot more easily than normal. These conditions include:\n\ncancer \u2013 cancer treatments such as\u00a0chemotherapy and\u00a0radiotherapy can increase this risk further\nheart disease\u00a0and lung disease\ninfectious conditions, such as hepatitis\ninflammatory conditions, such as\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis\nthrombophilia\u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition where your blood has an increased tendency\u00a0to clot\nantiphospholipid syndrome\u00a0\u2013 an immune system disorder that causes an increased risk of blood clots\u00a0\n\nPregnancy\nDuring pregnancy, blood clots more easily. It's the body's way of preventing too much blood being lost during childbirth.\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE)\u00a0\u2013 DVT and pulmonary embolism\u00a0\u2013 affects about 1\u00a0in 100,000 women of childbearing age.\nDVTs are also rare in pregnancy, although\u00a0pregnant women are up to 10 times more likely to develop thrombosis than non-pregnant women of the same age. A clot can form at any stage of pregnancy and up to 6\u00a0weeks after the birth.\nHaving thrombophilia (a condition where the blood has an increased tendency to clot), or having a parent, or brother or sister, who's had a thrombosis, increase your risk of developing a DVT during pregnancy.\nOther risk factors during pregnancy include:\n\nbeing over 35 years old\nbeing\u00a0obese (with a BMI of 30 or more)\nexpecting 2 or more babies\nhaving recently had a\u00a0caesarean section\nbeing immobile for long periods of time\nsmoking (find out how to stop smoking)\nhaving severe varicose veins\ndehydration\n\nLow molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is usually used to treat pregnant women with DVT. LMWH is an anticoagulant, which means it prevents the blood clot getting bigger. It's given by injection and doesn't affect your developing baby.\nContraceptive pill and HRT\nThe\u00a0combined contraceptive pill\u00a0and\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\u00a0both contain the female hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen causes the blood to clot a bit more easily than normal,\u00a0so your risk of getting DVT is slightly increased. There's no increased risk from the progestogen-only contraceptive pill.\nOther causes\nYour risk of getting DVT is also\u00a0increased if you or a close relative have previously had DVT and:\n\nyou're overweight or obese\nyou smoke\nyou're dehydrated\nyou're over 60\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you have a condition that restricts your mobility\n\n\n\nIf you have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), you'll need to take a medicine called an anticoagulant.\nAnticoagulation\nAnticoagulant medicines\u00a0prevent blood clots getting bigger.\u00a0They can also help stop part of the blood clot breaking off and becoming lodged in another part of your bloodstream (an embolism).\nAlthough they're often referred to as \"blood-thinning\" medicines, anticoagulants don't actually thin the blood. They alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily.\nHeparin and warfarin are 2 types of anticoagulants that are used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting.\u00a0After this initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming.\nHeparin is available in 2\u00a0different forms:\n\nstandard (unfractioned) heparin\nlow molecular weight heparin (LMWH)\n\nStandard (unfractioned) heparin can be given as:\n\nan intravenous injection\u00a0\u2013 an injection straight into one of your veins\nan intravenous infusion\u00a0\u2013 where a continuous drip of heparin (via a pump)\u00a0is fed through a narrow tube into a vein in your arm (this must be done in hospital)\na subcutaneous injection\u00a0\u2013 an injection under your skin\n\nLMWH is usually given as a subcutaneous injection.\nThe dose of standard (unfractionated) heparin to treat a blood clot varies significantly from person to person, so the dosage must be carefully monitored and adjusted if necessary. You may need to stay in hospital for 5 to 10 days and have frequent\u00a0blood tests to ensure you receive the right dose.\nLMWH\u00a0works differently from standard heparin. It contains small molecules, which means its effects are more reliable and you won't have to stay in hospital and be monitored.\nBoth standard heparin and LMWH can cause side effects, including:\n\na skin rash and other\u00a0allergic reactions\nbleeding\u00a0\nweakening of the bones if taken for a long time (although rare with LMWH)\n\nIn rare cases, heparin can also cause an extreme reaction that makes existing blood clots worse and causes new clots to develop.\u00a0This reaction, and weakening of your bones, is less likely to occur when\u00a0taking LMWH.\nIn most cases, you'll be given LMWH\u00a0because\u00a0it's easier to use and causes fewer side effects.\nWarfarin\u00a0is taken as a tablet. You may need to take it after initial treatment with heparin\u00a0to prevent further blood clots occurring. Your doctor may recommend that you take warfarin for 3\u00a0to 6 months. In some cases, it may need to be taken for longer,\u00a0even for\u00a0life.\nAs with standard heparin, the effects of warfarin vary from person to person. You'll need to be closely monitored by having frequent blood tests to ensure you're taking the right dosage.\nWhen you first start taking warfarin, you may need to have 2 to 3\u00a0blood tests a week until your regular dose is decided. After this, you should only need to have a blood test every 4\u00a0weeks at an anticoagulant outpatient clinic.\nWarfarin can be affected by your diet, any other medicines you're taking, and by how well your liver is working.\nIf you're taking warfarin you should:\n\nkeep your diet consistent\nlimit the amount of\u00a0alcohol you drink (no more than 14 units of alcohol a week)\ntake your dose of warfarin at the same time every day\nnot start to take any other medicine without checking with your GP, pharmacist or anticoagulant specialist\nnot take herbal medicines\n\nWarfarin isn't recommended for pregnant women who are given heparin injections for the full length of treatment.\nRivaroxaban is a medication recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u00a0as a possible treatment for adults with DVT, or to help prevent recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism.\nRivaroxaban comes in tablet form. It's a type of anticoagulant known as a\u00a0directly acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC). It prevents blood clots forming by inhibiting a substance called factor Xa and restricting the formation of thrombin (an enzyme that helps blood clot).\nTreatment usually lasts 3\u00a0months and involves taking rivaroxaban twice a day for the first 21 days and then once a day\u00a0until\u00a0the end of the course.\nRead the NICE guidance about rivaroxaban\nNICE also recommends\u00a0apixaban as a possible method of treatment and prevention for DVT and pulmonary embolism.\nLike\u00a0rivaroxaban, apixaban is a DOAC that's taken orally as a tablet, and prevents blood clots forming by hindering factor Xa and restricting the formation of thrombin.\nTreatment usually lasts at least 3 months and involves taking apixaban twice a day.\nRead the NICE guidance about apixaban\nCompression stockings\nWearing compression stockings helps prevent calf pain and swelling, and lowers the risk of ulcers developing after having DVT.\nThey can also help prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. This is damage to leg tissue caused by the increase in venous pressure that occurs when a vein is blocked by a clot and blood is diverted to the outer veins.\nAfter having DVT, stockings should be worn every day for at least 2\u00a0years. This is because symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome may develop several months or even years after having a DVT.\nCompression stockings should be fitted professionally and your prescription should be reviewed every 3 to 6\u00a0months. The stockings need to be worn all day but can be taken off before going to bed or in the evening while you rest with your leg raised. A spare pair of compression stockings should also be provided.\nExercise\nYour healthcare team will usually advise you to walk regularly once compression stockings have been prescribed. This can help prevent symptoms of DVT returning and may help to improve or prevent complications of DVT, such as post-thrombotic syndrome.\nRaising your leg\nAs well as wearing compression stockings, you might be advised to raise your leg whenever you're resting. This helps to relieve the pressure in the veins of the calf and stops blood and fluid pooling in the calf itself.\nWhen raising your leg, make sure your foot is higher than your hip. This will help the returning blood flow from your calf. Putting a cushion underneath your leg while you're\u00a0lying down\u00a0should help raise your leg above the level of your hip.\nYou can also slightly raise the end of your bed to ensure that your foot and calf are slightly higher than your hip.\nRead more about preventing DVT\nInferior vena cava filters\nAlthough anticoagulant medicines and compression stockings are usually the only treatments needed for DVT, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters may be used as an alternative. This is\u00a0usually because anticoagulant treatment needs to be stopped, isn't suitable, or isn't working.\nIVC filters are small mesh devices that can be placed in a vein. They trap large fragments of a blood clot and stop it travelling to the heart and lungs. They can be used\u00a0to help prevent blood clots developing in the legs of people diagnosed with:\n\nDVT\npulmonary embolism\nmultiple severe injuries\n\nIVCs\u00a0can be placed in the vein permanently, or newer types of filters can be placed temporarily and removed after the risk of a blood clot has decreased.\nThe procedure to insert an IVC filter is carried out using\u00a0a local anaesthetic (where you're awake but the area is numb). A small cut is made in the skin and a catheter (thin, flexible\u00a0tube) is inserted into a vein in the neck or groin area. The\u00a0catheter is guided using an ultrasound scan. The IVC filter is then\u00a0inserted through the catheter and into the vein.\n\n\nThe 2 main complications of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome.\nPulmonary embolism\nA pulmonary embolism\u00a0is the most serious complication of DVT. It happens when a piece of\u00a0blood clot (DVT)\u00a0breaks off and travels through your bloodstream to your lungs, where it blocks one of the blood vessels. In severe cases this can be fatal.\nIf the\u00a0clot is small, it might not cause any symptoms. If it's medium-sized, it can cause\u00a0chest pain\u00a0and breathing difficulties. A large clot\u00a0can cause the lungs to collapse, resulting in\u00a0heart failure, which can be fatal.\nAbout one\u00a0in 10\u00a0people with an untreated DVT develops a severe pulmonary embolism.\nPost-thrombotic syndrome\nIf\u00a0you've had a DVT, you may develop long-term symptoms in your calf known as post-thrombotic syndrome. This\u00a0affects around 20-40% of people with a history of DVT.\nIf you have DVT, the blood clot in the vein of your calf can divert the flow of blood to other veins, causing an increase in pressure. This can affect the tissues of your calf and lead to symptoms, including:\n\ncalf pain\nswelling\na rash\u00a0\nulcers on the calf\u00a0(in severe cases)\u00a0\n\nWhen a DVT develops in your thigh vein, there's an increased risk of post-thrombotic syndrome occurring. It's also more likely to occur if you're overweight or if\u00a0you've had more than one DVT in the same leg.\n\n\nIf you're admitted to hospital or planning to go into hospital for surgery, your risk of developing a blood clot while you're there will be assessed.\nSurgery and some medical treatments can increase your risk of developing DVT\u00a0\u2013 see\u00a0causes of DVT for more information.\nIf you're thought to be at risk of developing DVT, your healthcare team can take a number of measures to prevent a blood clot forming.\nBefore going into hospital\nIf you're going into\u00a0hospital to have an operation, and you're taking the combined contraceptive pill or\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT), you'll be advised\u00a0to temporarily stop taking your medication four weeks before your operation.\nSimilarly, if you're taking medication to prevent blood clots, such as aspirin, you may be advised to stop taking it one week before your operation.\nThere's less risk of getting DVT when having a\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0compared with a general anaesthetic.\u00a0Your doctor will discuss whether it's possible for you to have a local anaesthetic.\nWhile you're in hospital\nThere are a number of things your healthcare team can do to help reduce your risk of getting DVT while you're in hospital.\nFor example, they'll make sure you have enough to drink so you don't become dehydrated, and they'll also encourage you to move around as soon as you're able to.\nDepending on your risk factors and individual circumstances, a number of different medications can be used to help prevent DVT. For example:\n\nanticoagulant medicines\u00a0\u2013 such\u00a0as\u00a0dabigatran etexilate or fondaparinux sodium, which are often used\u00a0to help prevent blood clots after certain types of surgery, including orthopaedic surgery\nlow molecular weight heparin (LMWH)\u00a0\u2013 often used in many cases to help prevent blood clots, including during and shortly after pregnancy\nunfractionated heparin (UFH)\u00a0\u2013 often used in people with severe kidney impairment or established\u00a0kidney failure\u00a0\n\nCompression stockings or compression devices are also commonly used to help keep the blood in your legs circulating.\nCompression stockings are worn around your feet, lower legs and thighs, and fit tightly to encourage your blood to flow more quickly around your body.\nCompression devices are inflatable and work in the same way as compression stockings, inflating at regular intervals to squeeze your legs and encourage blood flow.\nYour healthcare team\u00a0will usually\u00a0advise you\u00a0to walk regularly after you've been prescribed compression stockings. Keeping mobile can help prevent the\u00a0symptoms of DVT returning and may help prevent or improve complications of DVT, such as post-thrombotic syndrome.\nRead more about treating DVT\nWhen you leave hospital\nYou may need to continue to take anticoagulant medicine and wear compression stockings when you leave hospital.\nBefore you leave, your healthcare team should advise you about how to use your treatment, how long to continue using it for, and who to contact if you experience any problems.\nLifestyle changes\nYou can reduce your risk of getting DVT by making changes to your lifestyle, such as:\n\nnot\u00a0smoking\neating\u00a0a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet\ngetting\u00a0regular exercise\u00a0\nmaintaining a healthy weight or losing weight\u00a0if you're obese\n\nTravelling\nSee your GP before long-distance\u00a0travel if you're at risk of getting a DVT, or if you've had a DVT in the past.\nIf you're planning a long-distance plane, train or car journey\u00a0(journeys of six hours or more), make sure you:\n\ndrink plenty of water\navoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol because it can cause dehydration\navoid taking sleeping pills because they can cause immobility\nperform simple leg exercises, such as regularly flexing your ankles\ntake occasional short walks when possible\u00a0\u2013 for example, during refuelling stopovers\nwear elastic compression stockings\n\nRead more about preventing DVT when you travel\nIf you're travelling abroad, it's very important to ensure you're prepared should you or a family member fall ill.\nMake sure you have\u00a0full travel insurance to cover the cost of any healthcare you may need while abroad. This is particularly important if you have a pre-existing medical condition, such as\u00a0cancer or heart disease, which may increase your risk of developing DVT.\nDVT can be a very serious condition, and it's important you receive medical assistance as soon as possible. Treating DVT promptly will help minimise the risk of complications.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in.\nWhen the normal water content of your body is reduced, it\u00a0upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions.\nWater makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion,\u00a0flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy.\nSome of the early warning signs of\u00a0dehydration include:\n\nfeeling\u00a0thirsty and lightheaded\na\u00a0dry mouth\ntiredness\nhaving dark coloured, strong-smelling urine\npassing urine less often than usual\n\nA baby may be dehydrated if they:\n\nhave a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head\nhave few or no tears when they cry\nhave fewer wet nappies\nare drowsy\n\nThe body\u00a0is affected\u00a0even when you lose a small amount of fluid.\nRead more about the symptoms of dehydration\nWhat causes dehydration?\nDehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in\u00a0hot weather)\u00a0and your diet can contribute to dehydration.\nYou can also\u00a0become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as\u00a0persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or\u00a0sweating from a fever.\nRead more about the causes of dehydration\nWho is at risk from dehydration?\nAnyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include:\n\nbabies and infants \u2013 they have a low body weight and are sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss\nolder people \u2013 they may be less aware that they are becoming dehydrated and need to keep drinking fluids\npeople with a long-term health condition \u2013 such as diabetes\u00a0or alcoholism\nathletes \u2013 they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods\u00a0\n\nWhat to do\nIf you're dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids\u00a0such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts.\nIf you're finding it difficult to keep water down because you're vomiting,\u00a0try drinking small amounts more frequently.\nInfants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is\u00a0because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems.\nInstead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies). You might find a teaspoon or syringe can be helpful for getting fluid into a young child.\nIf left untreated, severe dehydration can be serious and cause fits (seizures), brain damage and death.\nRead more about treating dehydration\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP if your symptoms continue, despite drinking plenty of fluids, or if you think your baby or toddler is dehydrated.\nIf your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body.\nContact your GP, out-of-hours service or\u00a0NHS 24 111 service straight away if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\nextreme thirst\nfeeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused\nnot passing urine for eight hours\nrapid heartbeat\ndizziness when you stand up that doesn't go away after a few seconds\n\nYou should also contact your GP if your baby has had\u00a0six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.\u00a0\n\n\nDehydration can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on how much of your body weight is lost through fluids.\nTwo early signs of dehydration are\u00a0thirst and dark-coloured urine. This is the body's way of\u00a0trying to increase water intake and decrease water loss.\nOther symptoms may include:\n\ndizziness or light-headedness\nheadache\u00a0\ntiredness\ndry mouth, lips and eyes\npassing small amounts of urine\u00a0infrequently (less than three or four\u00a0times a day)\n\nDehydration can\u00a0also\u00a0lead to\u00a0a\u00a0loss of\u00a0strength and stamina. It's\u00a0a main\u00a0cause of heat exhaustion.\nYou should be able to reverse dehydration at this stage\u00a0by drinking\u00a0more fluids.\nIf dehydration is ongoing (chronic), it can affect your kidney function and increase the risk of\u00a0kidney stones. It can also lead to muscle damage and constipation.\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP if your symptoms continue despite drinking fluids, or if you suspect that your baby or toddler is dehydrated.\nYou should also contact your GP if your baby has\u00a0had\u00a0six or more episodes of diarrhoea\u00a0in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.\nIf dehydration is suspected, you may be given a\u00a0blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body.\nSevere dehydration\nIf dehydration is left untreated, it can become severe.\nSevere dehydration is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.\nContact your GP,\u00a0out-of-hours service\u00a0or\u00a0NHS 24 111\u00a0service\u00a0straight away if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\nfeeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused, and you think you may be dehydrated\ndizziness when you stand up that doesn't go away after a few seconds\nnot passing urine for eight hours\na weak pulse\na rapid pulse\nfits (seizures)\na low level of conciousness\n\nIf\u00a0severe\u00a0dehydration is not treated immediately, it can lead to complications. This level of dehydration needs hospital treatment and you will be put on a drip to restore the substantial loss of fluids.\nDehydration in babies\nA baby may be dehydrated if they have:\n\na sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head\nfew or no tears when they cry\na dry mouth\nfewer wet nappies\ndark yellow urine\ndrowsiness\nfast breathing\ncold and blotchy-looking hands and feet\n\nRead about how to treat dehydration in babies\n\n\nDehydration is caused by not drinking enough fluid or by losing more fluid than you take in. Fluid is lost through sweat, tears, vomiting, urine or diarrhoea.\nThe severity of dehydration\u00a0can\u00a0depend on a number of factors,\u00a0such as climate, level of physical activity and diet.\nThere are several causes of dehydration, which are described below.\nIllness\nDehydration is often the result of an illness, such as gastroenteritis, where fluid is lost through persistent bouts of diarrhoea and vomiting.\nSweating\nYou can also become dehydrated if you sweat excessively after a fever, exercise, or carrying out heavy, manual work in hot conditions.\nIn these situations, it's important to drink regularly to replace lost fluids. It doesn't necessarily need to be hot for you to lose a significant amount of fluid from sweating.\nChildren and teenagers are particularly at risk because they may ignore the symptoms of dehydration, or not know how to recognise and treat them.\nAlcohol\nDehydration can also occur as a result of drinking too much alcohol.\u00a0Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you wee more.\nThe headache associated with a hangover indicates that your body is dehydrated. You should try to drink plenty of water when you have been drinking alcohol.\nDiabetes\nIf you have diabetes, you're at risk of becoming dehydrated because you have high levels of glucose in your bloodstream. Your kidneys will try to get rid of the glucose by creating more urine, so your body becomes dehydrated from going to the toilet more frequently.\nRead more about the different types of diabetes\nWho's at risk?\nThe groups of people most at risk of dehydration are:\n\nbabies and infants \u2013 their low body weight makes them sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss\nolder people \u2013 they may be less aware they're becoming dehydrated and need to drink fluids\npeople with a long-term health condition \u2013 such as diabetes or\u00a0alcoholism\nathletes \u2013 they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods\n\nHyponatremia\nIt's possible to become overhydrated while exercising. This is known as hyponatremia and it's caused by low sodium (salt) levels in the blood. It can occur if too much water is drunk over a short period of time.\nHyponatremia sometimes affects athletes whose blood sodium level is reduced through sweat and then diluted by drinking large amounts of water.\nSymptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, vomiting and headache. In serious cases, the brain can swell, causing confusion, seizures, coma and, in rare cases, death.\n\n\nThe best way to treat dehydration is to rehydrate the body by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, diluted squash or diluted fruit juice.\nA sweet drink can help to replace lost sugar, and a salty snack can help to replace lost salt.\nBabies\nIf your baby is dehydrated, take\u00a0them to see your GP\u00a0as soon as possible. They'll be able to recommend appropriate treatments, such as those outlined below.\nGive\u00a0your baby plenty of liquids, such as breastmilk or formula. It can often be better to give them smaller amounts of fluid more frequently.\nDon't dilute your baby's formula (if you use it). Babies who are formula-fed\u00a0and those on solids can be\u00a0given extra water.\nAvoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly\u00a0if they have diarrhoea and vomiting,\u00a0because it can\u00a0make it worse.\nGiving your baby regular sips\u00a0(a few times an hour) of oral rehydration solution (ORS)\u00a0in addition to their usual feed (breastmilk, formula milk\u00a0and water) will help to replace lost fluids, salts and sugars.\nInfants and children\nInfants and children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given solely water, because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body and make the problem worse. Instead, they should have diluted squash or a special ORS (see below).\nIf you or your child is finding it difficult to hold down fluids because of vomiting, take smaller amounts more frequently.\u00a0You may find it easier to\u00a0use a spoon or a syringe to give your child small amounts of fluid.\nRead more about\u00a0vomiting in adults and vomiting in children and babies\nOral rehydration solutions\nWhen\u00a0you're dehydrated, you lose sugar and salts, as well as water. Drinking a rehydration solution\u00a0will enable you to re-establish the right balance of body fluids. The solution should contain a mixture of potassium and sodium salts, as well as glucose or starch.\nThere are several different rehydration products available over the counter from pharmacies or on prescription from your GP, including solutions that are suitable for infants and children.\nAsk your GP or pharmacist for advice about the most suitable rehydration solution for you or your child.\nSevere dehydration\nSeek\u00a0immediate\u00a0medical\u00a0help if you suspect someone is severely dehydrated (see symptoms of severe dehydration).\nThey may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. In particular, babies, infants and elderly people will need urgent treatment if they become dehydrated.\nFluid may be given up the nose using a nasogastric tube or\u00a0using\u00a0a saline drip into a vein (intravenously). This will provide essential nutrients faster than using solutions that you drink.\nIf you have had bowel surgery, some rehydration solutions may not contain enough salt. In this instance, you will need a higher-strength solution. Your GP or surgeon can recommend a suitable rehydration solution for you.\n\n\nYou should drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated.\nMost of the time, you can prevent dehydration by drinking water regularly throughout the day. Be guided by your thirst, but be aware that in hot weather, when exercising and during illness, you should drink more.\nMild dehydration can be relieved by drinking more water and diluted fruit squash. If necessary, you can purchase oral rehydration solutions (ORS) from a pharmacy. As a guide, passing pale or clear-coloured urine (wee) is a good sign that you're well hydrated.\nDrink\u00a0regularly\nIf you're active, or if the weather is particularly hot, there's a greater risk that you will become dehydrated. To prevent becoming dehydrated, you should increase your fluid intake.\nAs\u00a0different people\u00a0sweat at different rates, it's very difficult to provide specific recommendations about how much fluid you should drink. However, you should drink more than normal while exercising, and it's particularly important to\u00a0keep well hydrated if you're\u00a0exercising in warm conditions. This is\u00a0because you will sweat more and fluid will be lost from your body more rapidly.\nRarely, drinking more fluid than your body can process can reduce the\u00a0amount of sodium (salt) in your\u00a0blood. This can lead to a serious and potentially fatal condition\u00a0called hyponatremia. If you start to feel discomfort and bloating from drinking, stop drinking\u00a0and allow time to recover.\nIllness\nIf you, your child or someone you are caring for is ill, particularly with\u00a0a fever, vomiting or diarrhoea, there's a high risk\u00a0of becoming dehydrated, so it's important to start replacing fluid as soon as possible.\nAdvice for children\nThere are no specific recommendations regarding the amount of water or other fluids that children need.\nHowever, it's important for children to replace lost fluid, to prevent dehydration. Like adults, children lose more water when they are in hotter climates and when they are physically active.\nYou should give your child healthy drinks as part of an overall healthy, balanced diet.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Dementia with Lewy bodies, also known as Lewy body dementia, is a common form of dementia estimated to affect more than 100,000 people in the UK.\nThe term \"dementia\" describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) associated with gradual death of brain cells. It's rare in anyone younger than 65.\nSymptoms\u00a0usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of\u00a0several\u00a0years.\nSigns and symptoms\nPeople with dementia with Lewy bodies not only experience problems with memory and judgement, like those with Alzheimer's disease, but are also likely to\u00a0have difficulties with concentration and visual perception (recognising objects and making judgements about where they are in space).\nThey may experience:\n\nslowed movement, stiff limbs, and tremors\nrecurrent visual\u00a0hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there)\nsleep disturbances, including sleepiness during the day\nfainting, unsteadiness, and\u00a0falls\n\nPeople with the condition\u00a0tend to swing from a state of alertness to drowsiness or staring into space. These extreme changes may be unpredictable and happen from hour to hour or day to day.\nRead more about the symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies\nWhat causes dementia with Lewy bodies?\nDementia with Lewy bodies is caused by deposits of an\u00a0abnormal protein called Lewy bodies inside brain cells. These deposits, which are also found in people with\u00a0Parkinson\u2019s disease, build up in areas of the brain responsible for things such as memory and muscle movement.\nIt's not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain, but it's thought\u00a0they disrupt the brain's normal functions by interfering with chemical signals transmitted from one brain cell to another.\nDementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although\u00a0there have been reports of rare cases that seem to run in families.\nDiagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies\nIf you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment, and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.\nYour GP can do some simple checks to see if there is chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist clinic if necessary.\nAt one of these clinics,\u00a0you will be asked about your symptoms and have a physical check-up and memory test. You may also have\u00a0blood tests and brain scans.\nThe results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by\u00a0dementia with Lewy bodies, another type of dementia, or\u00a0something else\u00a0entirely.\nRead more\u00a0about how dementia with Lewy bodies is diagnosed\nHow dementia with Lewy bodies is managed\nThere is no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies or any\u00a0medication that will slow it down.\nHowever, a few different medicines can be effective in controlling some of the symptoms. In particular,\u00a0acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (used to treat Alzheimer's disease) have been shown to improve symptoms such as hallucinations and confusion in some people.\nSupportive\u00a0treatments\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language\u00a0therapy\u00a0\u2013 can help improve any problems with movement, everyday tasks, and communication.\nPsychological therapies and specific\u00a0dementia activities, such as memory caf\u00e9s, can also help\u00a0with memory loss, confusion, and feelings of disorientation.\nRead more about treating dementia with Lewy bodies\nOutlook\nHow quick dementia with Lewy bodies progresses varies from person to person. Home-based help will be needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home.\nThe average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that of Alzheimer's disease\u00a0\u2013 around five to eight years. However, as with Alzheimer's disease, this can be highly variable.\nIf you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you are not alone. The NHS, social services, and voluntary organisations will be able to provide advice and support to help you and your family.\n\n\nThe symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of a few years.\nLike other forms of dementia, the\u00a0condition causes problems with:\n\nthinking speed\nlanguage\nunderstanding\njudgement\nmemory (although significant memory loss may not occur until later on)\n\nPeople with\u00a0dementia with Lewy bodies may also have other symptoms that can help distinguish it from other types of dementia, such as:\n\nextreme swings\u00a0between alertness\u00a0and confusion or drowsiness, which may happen unexpectedly and change from hour to hour or day to day\nslow movement, stiff limbs, and\u00a0tremors (as seen in Parkinson's disease), which cause shuffling when walking\nseeing or hearing things that aren't\u00a0real (hallucinations), which can\u00a0range from\u00a0pleasant to distressing\nfainting, unsteadiness, and\u00a0falls\u00a0\nsleep disturbances, which\u00a0can cause talking in your sleep or acting out dreams\nloss of facial expression\ndifficulty\u00a0swallowing\u00a0(dysphagia)\ndepression\u00a0\n\nThese symptoms can make daily activities very difficult and can lead to further health problems, such as injuries from falls, and\u00a0chest infections caused by accidentally inhaling\u00a0food instead of swallowing it.\u00a0\nSeeking medical advice\nIf you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them.\nSymptoms of dementia can have a number of different causes. Your GP will be able to carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for further tests if necessary.\nRead more about diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies\n\n\nConfirming a diagnosis of dementia can be difficult, particularly when the condition is in its early stages. This is because many of the symptoms of dementia can also be caused by other conditions.\nFor dementia with\u00a0Lewy bodies to be diagnosed correctly, you will have a number of tests and assessments, including:\n\nan assessment of your symptoms \u2013 for example, whether you have typical symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies\na full assessment of your mental abilities\na physical examination\na review of the medication you are taking\na range of tests, including blood tests, to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as a vitamin B12 deficiency\nbrain scans, such as a computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which\u00a0can check for signs of a stroke, brain tumour or brain shrinkage \u2013\u00a0a\u00a0single photon emission\u00a0CT (SPECT) scan, which looks at the dopamine system in the brain, can also sometimes\u00a0help\n\nSome of these tests can be carried out by your GP. Some will be carried out by other specialists, such as a neurologist (an expert in treating conditions that affect the brain and nervous system), an elderly care physician, or a psychiatrist with experience of treating dementia.\nAssessing your mental abilities\nThe Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is widely used to help test mental ability.\nThe MMSE can be used to assess a number of different mental abilities, including:\n\nshort- and long-term memory\nattention span\nconcentration\nlanguage and communication skills\nability to plan\nability to understand instructions\n\nThe MMSE\u00a0involves a series of tasks, which together\u00a0carry a\u00a0maximum score of 30 points. Example\u00a0tasks include:\n\nmemorising a short list of objects and then repeating the list back\ncorrectly identifying the day of the week, the date, or the year\n\nThe MMSE is not a test to diagnose dementia, but it's useful for assessing the level of mental impairment a person with dementia may have.\n\n\nThere's currently no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies, but treatments can help manage the symptoms.\nFirst of all, your future health and social care needs will need to be assessed and a care plan drawn up.\nThis\u00a0is a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. It involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance, such as:\n\nwhat support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible\nwhether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in\nwhether you need any financial assistance\n\nRead more about\u00a0care plans\nMedication\nMedication cannot stop the progression of dementia with Lewy bodies, but\u00a0it can sometimes help reduce the symptoms.\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as\u00a0donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Reminyl) or rivastigmine (Exelon), may help improve hallucinations, confusion, and drowsiness in some people.\nThese medicines\u00a0work by increasing levels of the chemical acetylcholine in the brain, which improves the ability of\u00a0the brain cells to send signals to each other.\nCommon side effects of\u00a0acetylcholinesterase inhibitors include feeling and being sick, diarrhoea, headaches, fatigue (extreme tiredness), and muscle cramps.\nOther medications that may help control some of the symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies include:\n\nlevodopa (a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease) can help reduce movement problems, although it can also worsen hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms, so it needs to be carefully monitored by your doctor\nantidepressants may help you cope if you have depression\nclonazepam can sometimes help improve your sleep if you experience sleep disturbances\n\nAntipsychotics, such as haloperidol, should be avoided wherever possible, and should only be used\u00a0to treat\u00a0severely challenging behaviour that is putting you or others at risk of harm. This is because they can cause a range of serious side effects, including rigidity and immobility.\nIf antipsychotics are needed, they will be prescribed at the lowest possible dose, for the shortest possible time, by a specialist experienced in treating dementia with Lewy bodies.\u00a0\nSupportive measures and\u00a0treatments\nIn addition to medication, there are\u00a0a number of therapies and practical measures that can help make everyday living easier for someone with dementia. These include:\n\noccupational therapy to identify problem areas in everyday life, such as getting dressed, and help work out practical solutions\nspeech and language therapy to help improve any communication or swallowing problems\nphysiotherapy to help with movement difficulties\npsychological treatments, such as cognitive stimulation, to help improve memory, problem-solving skills and language ability\nrelaxation techniques, such as massage, and music or dance therapy\nhome modifications, such as removing loose carpets and potential trip hazards, ensuring the home is well lit, and\u00a0adding grab bars and handrails\nchecking for problems with vision and hearing that could be contributing to hallucinations\n\nRead more about living well with dementia\nLegal matters\nIf you have been diagnosed with dementia, you will need to make arrangements for your care that take into account the\u00a0gradual decline in your mental abilities. This\u00a0should include ensuring that your wishes are upheld if\u00a0you're not able to make decisions for yourself.\nYou may wish to\u00a0draw up an\u00a0advance decision after first receiving a diagnosis of dementia. This makes your treatment preferences known now, in case you are unable to do this in the future.\nYou may also\u00a0want\u00a0to\u00a0consider\u00a0giving a relative\u00a0lasting power of attorney.

It's also common for people with depression to have symptoms of anxiety.\nPhysical symptoms happen with depression too \u2013 these can include feeling tired all the time, getting poor sleep, losing your sex drive, losing your appetite, and feeling aches and pains.\nIf the symptoms are mild, you might simply experience a persistent low mood. It's common to feel stressed, sad or anxious during difficult times in your life, and a low mood can get better after a short time, rather than being a symptom of depression.\nLearn more about low mood and depression here.\nSevere symptoms of depression can make people feel suicidal \u2013 as if life is no longer worth living. Read more about depression symptoms here.\nSeeing a doctor about depression\nBig changes in your life, like bereavement, losing a job, or even having a baby, can cause symptoms of depression. You're also more likely to experience depression if you have a family history of depression. However, it's also possible to become depressed without there being an obvious reason.\nYou can learn more about depression causes here.\n\n\nSymptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. However, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy.\nDepression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months.\nDoctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is:\n\nmild depression \u2013 it has some impact on daily life\nmoderate depression \u2013 it has a significant impact on your daily life\nsevere depression \u2013 this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day\n\nA few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychotic depression.\nBelow is a list of depression symptoms \u2013 it's unlikely that one person would have all of them.\n\ncontinuous sadness or low mood\nlosing interest in things\nlosing motivation\nnot getting any enjoyment in life\nfeeling tearful\nfeeling guilty\nfeeling anxious\nfeeling irritable\nfinding it hard to make decisions\nfeeling intolerant of other people\nfeeling helpless\nfeeling hopeless\nlow self-esteem\nfeeling worried\nthinking about suicide\nthinking about harming yourself\n\n\nspeaking or moving slower than usual\naches and pains that can't be explained\nlosing, or sometimes gaining, appetite or weight\nconstipation\nloss of interest in sex\ndisturbed sleep (having trouble falling asleep, for example, or waking up very early)\nloss of energy\nchanges in your menstrual cycle (the time of the month when you get your period)\n\nSocial symptoms are common too. These include:\n\navoiding talking to or spending time with your friends\ntaking part in fewer social activities\nneglecting interests and hobbies\ndoing poorly at work\ndifficulties with your family or home life\n\nIt's not always possible to tell that you're having symptoms of depression right away \u2013 it can start and progress gradually. A lot of people don't realise they're ill and try to carry on and cope with their symptoms. Sometimes it takes a friend or family member to notice that there's a problem.\nDepression and grief\nDepression and grief have a lot of the same features, and it can be hard to tell them apart. However, they're different in many important ways. Depression is an illness \u2013 grief is a completely natural response to loss.\nIf you're grieving, you may find your feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but it's still possible to enjoy things in life and look forward to the future.\nPeople with depression feel sad persistently, find it difficult to be positive about the future, and don't get enjoyment from anything.\nLearn more about the differences between grief and depression here.\nDifferent types of depression\nThere are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. These conditions include:\n\nBipolar disorder \u2013 people with bipolar disorder, which is also known as \"manic depression\", experience times of depression, where the symptoms are similar to clinical depression. They also go through phases when they have excessively high moods (known as \"mania\"). Bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour like unsafe sex, spending sprees and gambling.\nSeasonal affective disorder (SAD) is also called \"winter depression\". It's depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally.\nPostnatal depression happens to some women after they've had a baby. It's treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy.\n\nLearn more about how depression is diagnosed here.\nCauses of depression\nDepression doesn't have one single cause \u2013 it can have a range of triggers, and there are many different reasons a person can develop the condition. Some people are affected after a stressful life event, like a bereavement or divorce. Other people experience depression related to illness, job loss, or money worries.\nDifferent reasons can combine and trigger depression. If you're feeling low after a job loss or health issues, and then experience something traumatic, like a bereavement, you can develop depression.\nIt's common to hear about depression being brought on by a \"downward spiral\" \u2013 one thing causing other problems that combine to cause depression. For example, losing your job could make you feel sad, so you spend less time with family and friends and maybe drink more alcohol. These things all make you feel worse, which triggers depression.\nThere are studies that suggest people are more likely to become depressed when they get older. There's also evidence that depression is more common for people whose economic and social circumstances are difficult.\nLong-lasting or life-threatening conditions like cancer or coronary heart disease can put you at higher risk of developing depression.\nMany people don't know that head injuries can cause depression, and a severe head injury can lead to emotional problems and mood swings.\nUnderactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) can happen as a result of immune system problems. It's also possible, although rare, for a minor head injury to damage the pituitary gland. This is a gland the size of a pea which sits at the base of the brain and produces hormones that stimulate the thyroid. Damage to the pituitary gland can cause symptoms, including severe tiredness and a lack of interest in sex, which can then cause people to develop depression.\n\"Drowning your sorrows\" is actually a bad idea when it comes to depression. Alcohol is categorised as a \"strong depressant\" which can make depression worse, and drinking or taking drugs to cope can lead to a downward spiral by having a negative affect on other parts of your life.\nThere's evidence that cannabis can cause depression, particularly in teenagers, even if it helps you relax.\nThere are a number of things that can lead to developing depression.\n\nStressful events \u2013 big changes in your life, like bereavement, the end of a relationship or the loss of a job, can be difficult to deal with. When these things happen, it's important to keep seeing friends and family instead of trying to deal with problems alone \u2013 this increases your risk of developing depression.\nGiving birth \u2013 pregnancy and birth can make some people vulnerable to depression. Postnatal depression can happen as the result of physical changes, hormonal changes, and the responsibility of taking care of a new baby.\nLoneliness \u2013 your risk of depression gets higher if you aren't in contact or spending time with family and friends.\nPersonality \u2013 some personality traits can put you at a higher risk of developing depression. These include low-self esteem or a habit of criticising yourself too much. These personality traits can come from your genes, which you get from your parents, or they can be as a result of experiences in your early life.\nFamily history \u2013 it's more likely for someone to develop depression if a family member, like a sibling or parent, has experienced it before.\n\n\n\nThere's no physical test for depression.\nIf you experience depression symptoms most of the day, every day, for more than two weeks, you should visit your GP. This is especially important if:\n\nyou have symptoms of depression that aren't getting any better\nyou have thoughts of self-harm or suicide\nyour work, relationships with friends and family, or interests are affected by your mood\n\nIt can be hard for people with depression to imagine that anything can help them \u2013 but the sooner you seek help, the sooner the symptoms start to get better.\nYour GP may examine you and perform blood or urine tests to make sure there isn't another condition causing your depression symptoms, like an underactive thyroid.\nWhen you see your GP, they'll try to find out if you have depression by asking you questions. These are likely to be about your health, how you're feeling, and how that is affecting you mentally and physically.\nTelling your doctor your symptoms and the affect they are having on you will help your GP to tell if you have depression, and how severe the condition is. It's important to be as open as possible.\nYour conversation with your GP will be confidential. This rule can only be broken if your GP thinks there is a significant risk of harm to you or others, and that telling a family member or carer would make that risk lower.\nTreating depression\nThe first place to go is your GP \u2013 they will refer to you local talking treatments for depression that are available on the NHS.\nYou may also have the option to self-refer, depending on where you live, so you can go directly to a professional therapist if you'd rather not talk to your GP.\nTalking treatments for depression\nThere are a number of talking therapies for depression.\nCBT helps you make sense of your thoughts and behaviour and the affect they have on you. Part of it's recognising that past events may have played a part in making you who you are, but the main focus is changing how you feel, behave and think now.\nYou can use CBT to learn how to overcome negative thoughts \u2013 this can help you to tackle feelings of hopelessness, for example.\nMost people have a course of six to eight CBT sessions that goes over 10 to 12 weeks. Sessions are one-to-one, between you and a CBT-trained counsellor. You might also be offered group CBT.\nThis type of CBT is done using a computer instead of face-to-face with the counsellor. It should be supported by a healthcare professional \u2013 your GP may prescribe it, and you might have to use the computer in the GP surgery to access it. CCBT involves a series of weekly sessions.\nIPT is focused on your relationships with people around you, and problems that you might be having with them. These can include problems communicating, or dealing with a bereavement.\nThere's evidence that suggests IPT can be as effective for depression as CBT or medication, but more research needs to be done.\nThis is also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy. You'll work with a therapist who encourages you to say whatever you're thinking. This helps you to find hidden patterns and meanings in your words and behaviour that could be contributing to your depression.\nRead more about psychotherapy here.\nCounselling is a type of therapy that works really well if you have good mental wellbeing overall but need help coping with a crisis that's currently going on in your life. These can include anger, bereavement, infertility, relationship problems, job loss and serious illness.\nOn the NHS, counselling usually takes place over six to 12 sessions, each an hour long. The sessions are confidential.\nA counsellor helps you to think about what's going on in your life and find new ways of dealing with the problems. They'll offer practical advice, support you, and help you find solutions, but they don't tell you what to do.\nAntidepressants\nAntidepressants are medicines that treat depression symptoms. There are almost 30 different types of antidepressant that can be prescribed to you.\nMost people who have moderate or severe depression notice improvement when they take antidepressants, but this isn't the case for everyone. One type of antidepressant might not work for you, but another one could. It can take two or more different treatments to find the right one for you.\nSide effects vary between different people and different antidepressants, but the different types of antidepressant all work around as well as each other.\nIf you're prescribed antidepressants, you should see your GP or specialist nurse regularly while you first start taking the medication \u2013 every week or two for at least four weeks. This is so your treatment provider can see how the antidepressants are working.\nIf the medication is working for you, you should continue taking them at the same dose for at least four to six months after the depression symptoms have eased. People who have had depression in the past might have to take antidepressants for up to five years, maybe longer.\nAntidepressants aren't addictive. However, you might have withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or miss a dose. You can read more about withdrawal symptoms below.\nIf your GP thinks you would benefit from taking an antidepressant, you'll usually be prescribed a modern type called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Examples of commonly used SSRI antidepressants are Seroxat (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine) and Cipramil (citalopram).\nThey help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a \"good mood\" chemical.\nSSRIs work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects.\nThey can, however, cause nausea and headaches, as well as a dry mouth and problems having sex. However, all these negative effects usually improve over time.\nSome SSRIs aren't suitable for children under the age of 18. Research shows that the risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour may increase if they're taken by under-18s. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI that can be prescribed for under-18s, and even then only when a specialist has given the go-ahead.\nThis group of antidepressants is used to treat moderate to severe depression.\nTCAs, which includes Imipramil (imipramine) and amitriptyline, have been around for longer than SSRIs.\nThey work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. These both help lift your mood.\nThey're generally quite safe, but it's a bad idea to smoke cannabis if you are taking TCAs because it can cause your heart to beat rapidly.\nSide effects of TCAs may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, light-headedness and excessive drowsiness, but vary from person to person.\nThe side effects usually ease after seven to 10 days, as your body gets used to the medication.\nNew antidepressants, such as Efexor (venlafaxine), Cymbalta or Yentreve (duloxetine) and Zispin Soltab (mirtazapine), work in a slightly different way from SSRIs and TCAs.\nVenlafaxine and duloxetine are known as SNRIs (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors). Like TCAs, they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.\nStudies have shown that an SNRI can be more effective than an SSRI, though they're not routinely prescribed as they can lead to a rise in blood pressure.\nAntidepressants are not addictive in the same way that illegal drugs and cigarettes are, but when you stop taking them you may have some withdrawal symptoms, including:\n\nupset stomach\nflu-like symptoms\nanxiety\ndizziness\nvivid dreams at night\nsensations in the body that feel like electric shocks\n\nIn most cases these are quite mild and last no longer than a week or two, but occasionally they can be quite severe. They seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (Seroxat) and venlafaxine (Efexor).\nWithdrawal symptoms occur very soon after stopping the tablets, so can easily be told apart from symptoms of depression relapse, which tend to occur after a few weeks.\nOther treatments for depression\nThere is a range of other treatments that people are given for depression.\nSt John's Wort is a herbal treatment that you can buy from pharmacies and health food shops. Some people take it for depression. There's some evidence that it can help the symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression, but doctors don't recommend St John's Wort because the amount of active ingredients change depending on the brand and batch. This means that you can never be sure what kind of effect it will have.\nIf you take St John's Wort with other medications, like anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, it can cause serious problems. St John's Wort can interact with the contraceptive pill and reduce its effectiveness at preventing pregnancy.\nYou shouldn't take St John's Wort while pregnant or breastfeeding, as we can't be certain that it's safe.\nIf you have severe depression and other treatments, like medication, haven't worked, ECT might be recommended for you.\nWhen receiving ECT, you will be given an anaesthetic and medication that relaxes your muscles to begin with. Electrodes will be placed on your head that give an electrical \"shock\" to your brain.\nECT is given over a series of sessions, normally twice a week for three to six weeks.\nECT can cause side effects including nausea, headaches, aches in the muscles and memory problems.\nMost people find that ECT is good for relieving severe depression, but the beneficial effects tend to wear off when several months have passed.\nIf you've tried several different antidepressants and had no improvement, your doctor may offer you a type of medication called lithium in addition to your current treatment.\nThere are two types of lithium: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you're taking one that works for you, it's best not to change.\nIf the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. You'll therefore need blood tests every three months to check your lithium levels while you're on the medication.\nYou'll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic. Ask your GP for advice about your diet.\n\n\nThere's a lot of advice available for living with depression and feeling better.\nTalking about depression\nYou can find support and insight by talking about depression with another person or a group. According to research, talking can help you to recover and deal better with stress.\nIf you don't feel comfortable talking about your symptoms and feelings with other people, you can write about how you feel or use poetry or art to express yourself \u2013 doing this can also help you to feel better.\nIt might feel like cigarettes and alcohol are helpful, but in the long run they can make you feel worse.\nIf you have depression it's especially important to be careful when it comes to cannabis. Research has shown there's a strong connection between mental health problems and cannabis use.\nAccording to the evidence, if you smoke cannabis while dealing with depression:\n\nyour symptoms get worse\nyou feel less interested in things\nyou're more likely to have earlier and more frequent relapses of depression\nyou're less likely to recover fully from depression\nyou feel more tired\nyou won't respond as well to antidepressants\nyou're more likely to stop taking antidepressants\n\nYou can get advice and support from your GP on cutting down or stopping drinking, smoking, and drug use.\nLearn more about stopping smoking here\nLearn more about help to cut down or stop drinking alcohol here\nWork, money, and depression\nYou might need to take time off work if your depression is caused by working too much, or if the symptoms are making it hard for you to do your job. However, research has shown that taking a long time off work can make depression worse, and that going back to work can help you to get better.\nWhen you're dealing with depression it's important to avoid as much stress, work-related and otherwise, as you can. If you're working you might be able to change to shorter hours, or work more flexibly. This is especially true if pressure at work causes you to experience depression symptoms.\nThe Equality Act means that employers need to make reasonable adjustments to make it possible to employ people with disabilities \u2013 this can include people who have been diagnosed with depression and other mental health conditions.\nYou can find more information about dealing with stress at work here.\nIf your depression means you are unable to work, there are benefits you may be eligible to claim. These include:\n\nAttendance Allowance\nCarer's Allowance\nCouncil Tax Benefit\nPersonal Independence Payment (PIP)\nHousing Benefit\nEmployment and Support Allowance (ESA)\nStatutory Sick Pay\n\nBereavement and depression\nYour depression can be triggered by losing someone who is close to you. The emotional blow suffered when a person you care about dies is powerful \u2013 it might feel like you will never recover from the loss.\nAlong with time, the right help and support can make it possible to start living your life again. Find out more about coping with a bereavement here.\nLooking after someone who has depression\nIf you're close to someone with depression, their condition can affect you too. Your relationship, and family life in general, can be strained, and you might not know what to do or how to help.\nTalking about the situation can help. Finding a support group, or talking to other people in a similar situation, can make it easier to cope. If the condition is causing difficulties in your relationship with your partner, you could contact a relationship counsellor who can talk things through with both of you.\nWhen suffering from depression, men are less likely to ask for help than women. They're also more likely to turn to drugs and alcohol to cope with the symptoms.\nDepression and suicide\nThe majority of suicide cases are linked with mental disorders, and most of them are triggered by severe depression.\nWarning signs that someone with depression may be considering suicide are:\n\nmaking final arrangements, like giving away their things, making a will or saying goodbye to friends\ntalking about death or suicide \u2013 this may be with direct statements, like \"I wish I was dead\", but often depressed people talk about the subject indirectly, saying things like: \"I think dead people must be happier than us\" or \"wouldn't it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up\"\nself-harm, like cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes\na sudden lifting of mood, which could mean that a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of this decision\n\nIf you're feeling suicidal or are in a crisis of depression, contact your GP as soon as possible. They will be able to help you.\nIf you can't or don't want to contact your GP, call the Samaritans on 116 123, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Alternatively, visit the Samaritans website or email\u00a0jo@samaritans.org.\nIf you see any of the above warning signs:\n\nget professional help for the person\nlet them know they're not alone and that you care about them\noffer your support in finding other solutions to their problems\n\nIf you feel there is an immediate danger, stay with the person or have someone else stay with them, and remove all available means of committing suicide, such as medication.\nOver-the-counter drugs such as painkillers can be just as dangerous as prescription medication.\nAlso, remove sharp objects and poisonous household chemicals such as bleach.\n\n\nSome people who have severe depression will also experience symptoms of psychosis \u2013 these are hallucinations and delusional thinking.\nDepression with psychosis is known as psychotic depression.\nSymptoms of severe depression\nPeople who have severe clinical depression feel sad and hopeless for most of the day, and feel no interest in anything. They feel this way practically every day, and getting through the day feels nearly impossible for them.\nOther symptoms include:\n\nfatigue (exhaustion)\nlosing pleasure in things\ninability to concentrate\ndifficulty making decisions\nsleep disturbance\nappetite changes\nfeeling guilty\nfeeling that they're worthless\nhaving thoughts about suicide, or death\n\nRead more about the different types of depression symptoms here.\nSymptoms of psychosis\nMoments of psychosis are known as psychotic episodes. The person experiencing a psychotic episode will have:\n\nDelusions \u2013 beliefs or thoughts that are likely to be false.\nHallucinations \u2013 hearing, seeing or sometimes smelling, feeling or tasting things that aren't there. Hearing voices is a common type of hallucination.\n\nHallucinations and delusions almost always reflect the deeply depressed mood of the person experiencing them. They may believe they have committed a crime or that they are to blame for something.\nPeople with psychosis also commonly experience something called psychomotor agitation. People experiencing this cannot sit still or relax, and fidget all the time.\nThe opposite symptom can also happen \u2013 psychomotor retardation can cause a person's thoughts and the movement of their body to slow down.\nPeople who have psychotic depression are at a higher risk of thinking about suicide.\nCauses and treatments of psychotic depression\nWe don't fully understand what causes psychotic depression yet. However, we know that depression doesn't have one single cause, and that the condition has a lot of different triggers.\nBig, stressful events like divorce, serious illness, financial worries, or bereavement can trigger depression for some people.\nSevere depression can run in families, which suggests genes might play a role in depression, but the reason some people develop psychosis as part of severe depression is not known.\nMany people who have psychotic depression have experienced a difficult time in childhood, like a traumatic event.\nLearn more about causes of clinical depression\nTreatment for psychotic depression has three main parts:\n\nmedication \u2013 taking a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants can help to relieve psychosis symptoms\npsychological therapies \u2013 cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy done one-to-one with a trained counsellor, and it has succeeded in helping some people with psychosis\nsocial support \u2013 support with social needs like employment, education and accommodation\n\nPeople with psychotic depression may have to spend some time in hospital to receive treatment.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT, or electric shock treatment) is sometimes recommended if other treatments, including antidepressants, haven't worked for severe depression.\nAlthough treatment for psychotic depression is usually very effective, people with the condition still need follow-up appointments with their treatment team so they can be continuously monitored.\nGetting help for someone with psychotic depression\nOften friends, relatives, or carers have to seek help for a person with psychotic depression. This is because people with psychosis often don't know they're acting and thinking strangely.\nIf you're worried about someone you know and think they may be experiencing psychosis, and they've been diagnosed with a mental health condition before, contact their community mental health team or social worker.\nIf they've never shown signs of a mental health condition and you think they may be experiencing psychotic depression, contact their GP or take them to Accident and Emergency (A&E).\nIf you think the person's symptoms are putting them at risk, you can:\n\ntake them to the nearest A&E, if they agree\nphone their GP\nphone the local out-of-hours GP\nphone 999 and ask for an ambulance\n\nAdvice and support\nVisit the SANE website or the Mind website for more information, support and advice about psychotic depression.\nLearn more about psychosis here\n\n\nPart of treating and living with depression is learning healthy thought patterns and coping skills that can help when you\u2019re feeling depressed.\u00a0\nOur mental health self-help guides are based on\u00a0Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)\u00a0and have proven highly successful in helping people with depression and other mental health issues.\nWork through a self-help guide for depression that uses Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Discoid eczema is a long-term skin condition that causes skin to become itchy, reddened, swollen and cracked in circular or oval patches.\nIt's also known as discoid dermatitis.\nThe patches\u00a0can be a few millimetres\u00a0to a few centimetres in size and can affect any part of the body, although they don't usually affect the face or scalp.\nThe patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid at first, but become\u00a0dry, crusty, cracked and flaky over time.\nThe patches may clear up on their own eventually, but this can\u00a0take weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can recur.\nRead more about the symptoms of discoid eczema.\nSeeking medical advice\nYou should see your pharmacist or GP if you think you may have discoid eczema.\nYour GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions.\nYour GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a doctor who specialises in managing skin conditions) if they are unsure of the diagnosis or if you need patch testing.\nYour GP or specialist can recommend suitable treatments.\nWhat causes discoid eczema?\nThe cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it is often accompanied by dry skin and is thought\u00a0to be triggered by irritation of the skin.\nDiscoid eczema\u00a0tends to affect adults and is rare in children. It is more common among men aged from 50 to 70 and women\u00a0in their teens or twenties.\nSome people with discoid eczema may also have other types of eczema, such as\u00a0atopic eczema.\nRead more about the causes of discoid eczema.\nHow discoid eczema is treated\nDiscoid eczema is usually a long-term problem, but medications are available to help relieve the symptoms and keep the condition under control.\nTreatments used include:\n\nemollients \u2013\u00a0moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry\ntopical corticosteroids\u00a0\u2013 ointments and creams applied to the skin that can help relieve severe symptoms\nantihistamines\u00a0\u2013 medications that can reduce itching and help you sleep better\n\nThere are also things you can do yourself to help, such as avoiding all the irritating chemicals in soaps, detergents, bubble baths and shower gels.\nAdditional medication can be prescribed if your eczema is infected or particularly severe.\nRead more about treating discoid eczema.\n\n\nDiscoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema.\nThe patches can appear anywhere on the body, including the:\n\nlower legs\nforearms\ntrunk (torso)\nhands\nfeet\n\nThe face and scalp are not\u00a0normally affected.\nThe\u00a0first sign of discoid eczema is\u00a0usually a group of small red spots or bumps on the skin. These then quickly join up to form larger\u00a0pink, red or brown patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size.\nInitially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night.\nOver time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky.\u00a0The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of\u00a0discoloured skin that can be mistaken for\u00a0ringworm.\nYou may just have one patch of discoid eczema, but most people have several patches. The skin between the patches\u00a0is often dry.\nPatches of discoid eczema can last for weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can keeping recurring \u2013 often\u00a0in the same area that was affected previously.\nOccasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up.\nSigns of an infection\nPatches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include:\n\nthe patches oozing a lot of fluid\na yellow crust developing over the patches\nthe skin around the patches becoming red, hot, swollen, and tender or painful\nfeeling sick\nchills\na general sense of feeling unwell\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see your GP or pharmacist if you think you may have discoid eczema, as the condition can take a long time to improve without treatment and it may keep recurring.\nYou should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected, as you may need to use\u00a0antibiotic cream or, in very severe cases, take antibiotics tablets.\nRead more about diagnosing discoid eczema.\n\n\nThe cause of discoid eczema is unknown, although it may occur as a result of having particularly dry skin.\nDry skin means your skin cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it, which could allow\u00a0a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate (damage) your skin.\nIt's important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin.\nContact dermatitis, a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may therefore have a role in discoid eczema.\nSome people with discoid eczema also have a history of\u00a0atopic eczema, which often occurs in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever. However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families.\nOther possible triggers\nAn outbreak of discoid eczema may sometimes be triggered by a minor skin injury, such as an\u00a0insect bite or a burn.\nSome medicines may also be associated with discoid eczema, as patches of eczema can appear in people taking:\n\ninterferon and ribavirin \u2013 when they are used together to treat hepatitis C\u00a0\ntumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) blockers \u2013 which are used to treat some types of arthritis\nstatins\u00a0(cholesterol-lowering medication), which can cause dry skin and rashes\n\nDry environments and cold climates can make discoid eczema worse and sunny or humid (damp) environments may make your symptoms better.\n\n\nThere is no simple cure for discoid eczema, but there are medications that can help ease the symptoms.\nThese include:\n\nemollients \u2013 to use all the time\nsoap substitutes \u2013 to replace irritating soaps and cleaning products\ntopical corticosteroids \u2013 for flare-ups\noral corticosteroids \u2013 for severe flare-ups\nantibiotics\u00a0\u2013 for infected eczema\nantihistamines \u2013 for severe itching\n\nThere are many different preparations for each type of medication and it is worth taking time with your pharmacist to find the best one for you.\nA range of emollient products, soap substitutes and some topical corticosteroids can be bought from pharmacies without a prescription. Some of them are cheaper to buy this way than with a prescription.\nAsk your pharmacist for advice on the different products and how to use them. See your GP if your eczema does not improve after using an over-the-counter preparation.\nSelf-help\nThere are also some self-help tips\u00a0that may help to control symptoms of discoid eczema, such as:\n\navoiding soaps and detergents, including liquid soaps, bubble bath, shower gels and wet wipes \u2013 even if these do not obviously irritate your skin; you should use an emollient soap substitute instead\nprotecting your skin from minor cuts (for example, by wearing gloves) as they may trigger discoid eczema\ntaking daily lukewarm baths or showers \u2013 using an emollient when washing may reduce your symptoms, and remember to apply your treatments soon afterwards\nnot scratching the patches \u2013 keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short may help reduce the risk of skin damage or infection from unintentional scratching\nmaking sure you use and apply your treatments as instructed by your GP or pharmacist\n\nIf you suspect your skin is infected, for example because there is excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema, see your GP. Infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection.\nEmollients\nEmollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.\nSeveral different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as:\n\nan ointment for very dry skin\na cream or lotion for less dry skin\nan emollient to use instead of soap\nan emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower\none emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body\n\nThe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.\nCreams and lotions tend to be more suitable for red, inflamed (swollen) areas of skin. Ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that are not inflamed.\nIf you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, your GP will be able to prescribe another product.\nUse your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms as they can help limit the return of your condition. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school.\nTo apply the emollient:\n\nuse a large amount\ndon't rub it in, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows instead\nfor very dry skin, apply the emollient every two to three hours\nafter a bath or shower, gently dry the skin and then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist\n\nIf you are exposed to irritants at work, make sure you apply emollients regularly during and after work.\nDon't share emollients with other people.\nOccasionally, some emollients can irritate the skin. If you have discoid eczema, your skin will be sensitive and can react to certain ingredients in over-the-counter emollients. If your skin reacts to the emollient, stop using it and speak to your GP, who can recommend an alternative product.\nEmollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.\nTopical corticosteroids\nTo treat the patches of discoid eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin) to reduce the inflammation.\nYou may be concerned about using medication that contains steroids. However, corticosteroids are not the same as anabolic steroids, which are sometimes used by bodybuilders and athletes. When used as instructed by your pharmacist or doctor, corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment for discoid eczema.\nThere are different strengths of topical corticosteroids that can be prescribed depending on the severity of your eczema. Discoid eczema usually needs a stronger type of corticosteroid than other types of eczema.\nYou might be prescribed a cream to be used on visible areas, such as face and hands, and an ointment to be used at night or for more severe flare-ups.\nWhen using corticosteroids, apply the treatment accurately to the affected areas. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, you should follow directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the corticosteroid.\nDo not apply the corticosteroid more than twice a day. Most people will only have to apply it once a day.\u00a0\nTo apply the topical corticosteroid, take the following steps:\n\napply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid, until the emollient has soaked into your skin\napply a\u00a0good amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area\u00a0\u00a0\nuse the topical corticosteroid until the inflammation has cleared up, unless otherwise advised by your GP\n\nSpeak to your prescriber if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.\nTopical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause:\n\nthinning of the skin\nchanges in skin colour\nacne (spots)\nincreased hair growth\n\nMost of these side effects will improve once treatment stops.\nGenerally, using a stronger topical corticosteroid, or using a large amount of topical corticosteroid, will increase your risk of getting side effects. For this reason, you should use the weakest and smallest amount possible to control your symptoms.\nCorticosteroid tablets\nIf you have a severe flare-up, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid tablets to take for up to a week.\nIf corticosteroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as:\n\nreduced growth rate in children\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nosteoporosis (brittle bones)\ndiabetes\n\nFor this reason, your doctor is unlikely to prescribe repeat courses of corticosteroid tablets without referring you to a specialist.\nAntibiotics\nIf your eczema becomes infected, you may also be prescribed an antibiotic.\nIf you have an extensive area of infected eczema, you may be prescribed an antibiotic to take by mouth. This is most commonly flucloxacillin, which is usually taken for one week. If you are allergic to penicillin, you might be given an alternative such as clarithromycin.\nIf you have a small amount of infected eczema, you will normally be prescribed a topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid. This means\u00a0the medicine is applied directly to the affected area of skin, in the form of an ointment or cream.\nSome topical antibiotics are available in creams or ointments that also contain topical corticosteroids.\nTopical antibiotics should normally be used for\u00a0up to 2\u00a0weeks as necessary.\nAntihistamines\nAntihistamines are a type of medicine that work by stopping the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. Your body often releases histamine when it comes into contact with an irritant. Histamine can cause a wide range of symptoms, including sneezing, watery eyes and itching.\nAntihistamines may be prescribed during flare-ups of discoid eczema to cope with the symptom of itching, particularly if it is interfering with your sleep. However, they will not treat the damaged skin.\nMany older types of antihistamines can make you drowsy, which can be useful if your symptoms affect the quality of your sleep. Otherwise, ask your pharmacist or GP to recommend one of the more modern \u201cnon-sedating\u201d antihistamines.\nFurther treatments\nIf the treatments prescribed by your GP are not successfully controlling your symptoms, they may refer you for assessment and treatment by a dermatologist (specialist in treating skin conditions).\nFurther treatments that may be available from your dermatologist include:\n\nphototherapy \u2013 where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to help reduce inflammation\nbandaging \u2013 where medicated dressings are applied to your skin\nimmunosuppressant therapy \u2013 medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Diverticular disease and diverticulitis are related digestive conditions that affect the large intestine (colon).\nIn\u00a0diverticular disease,\u00a0small bulges or pockets (diverticula) develop in the lining of the intestine. Diverticulitis is when these pockets\u00a0become inflamed or infected.\nSymptoms of diverticular disease include:\n\nlower abdominal pain\nfeeling bloated\n\nThe majority of people with diverticula will not have any symptoms; this is known as diverticulosis.\nSymptoms of diverticulitis tend to be more serious and include:\n\nmore severe abdominal pain, especially on the left side\nhigh temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\ndiarrhoea or frequent bowel movements\n\nRead more about the symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.\nDiverticulosis, diverticular disease\u00a0and diverticulitis\n\"Diverticula\" is the medical term used to describe the small bulges that stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon).\nDiverticula are common and associated with ageing. The large intestine becomes weaker with age, and the pressure of hard stools passing through the large intestine\u00a0is thought to\u00a0cause the bulges to form.\nRead more about the causes of diverticula.\nIt's estimated that\u00a05% of people have diverticula by the time they are 40 years old, and at least 50% of people have them by the time they are 80 years old.\n1\u00a0in 4\u00a0people who develop diverticula will experience symptoms, such as abdominal pain.\nHaving symptoms associated with diverticula is known as diverticular disease.\nDiverticulitis describes infection that occurs when bacteria becomes trapped inside one of the bulges, triggering more severe symptoms.\nDiverticulitis can lead to complications, such as an abscess next to\u00a0the intestine.\nRead more about the\u00a0complications of diverticulitis.\nTreating diverticular disease and diverticulitis\nA high-fibre diet can often ease\u00a0symptoms of diverticular disease, and\u00a0paracetamol can be used to relieve pain\u00a0\u2013 other painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen are not recommended for regular use, as they can cause stomach upsets. Speak to your GP if paracetamol alone is not working.\nMild diverticulitis can usually be treated at home with antibiotics\u00a0prescribed by your GP. More serious cases may need hospital treatment to prevent and treat complications.\nSurgery to remove the\u00a0affected section of the intestine is sometimes recommended if there have been serious complications, although this is rare.\nRead more about treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis.\nWho is affected\nDiverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions.\nBoth sexes are equally affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women. Overall, symptoms of diverticulitis are most likely to occur in people over 70 years old.\nDiverticular disease is often described as a \"Western disease\" because the rates are high in European and North American countries, and low in African and Asian countries.\nA combination of genetics and diet is thought to be the reason for this and the fact that people in Western countries tend to\u00a0eat less fibre.\nPeople aged 50-70 who eat a high-fibre diet (25g a day) have a 40% lower chance of admission to hospital with complications of diverticular disease \u2013 compared to others in their age range with the lowest amount of dietary fibre.\n\n\nSymptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis include abdominal pain, bloating and a change in normal bowel habits.\nDiverticulosis\nIf diverticula have been discovered during a camera test for another reason (colonoscopy) or during a CT scan, you may be worried about what this means.\nHowever, if you have never had abdominal pain or bouts of diarrhoea, there is a 70-80% chance that you will never have any symptoms from them.\nDiverticula\u00a0are\u00a0extremely common over the age of 70 and they do not increase your risk of cancer.\u00a0It's thought that a high-fibre diet is likely to reduce the risk of any symptoms developing.\nDiverticular disease\nThe most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side.\nThe pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. Passing stools and breaking wind (flatulence) may help\u00a0relieve the pain.\nOther long-term symptoms of diverticular disease include:\n\na change in your normal bowel habits, such as\u00a0constipation or diarrhoea, or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea \u2013 a classic pattern is multiple trips to the toilet in the morning to pass stools like \"rabbit pellets\"\nbloating\n\nAnother possible symptom of diverticular disease is\u00a0bleeding dark purple blood from your rectum (back passage). This usually occurs after diarrhoea-like cramping pain, and often leads to hospital admission, but fortunately this is\u00a0an uncommon complication.\nDiverticular disease does not cause weight loss, so if you are losing weight, seeing blood in your stools or experiencing frequent bowel changes, see your GP.\nDiverticulitis\nDiverticulitis shares\u00a0most of the symptoms of diverticular disease (see above). However, the\u00a0pain associated with diverticulitis is constant and severe, rather than intermittent. It is most likely to occur if you have previously had symptoms of diverticular disease, and develops over a day or 2.\nOther symptoms of diverticulitis can include:\n\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\na general feeling of being tired and unwell\nfeeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)\n\nThe pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen.\nIn Asian people, the pain may move to the lower right-hand side of your abdomen. This is because East Asian people tend to develop diverticula in a different part of their colon for genetic reasons.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nContact your GP as soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of diverticulitis.\nIf you have symptoms of diverticular disease and the condition has previously been diagnosed, you do not usually need to contact your GP as\u00a0the symptoms can be treated at home.\u00a0\nRead more about the\u00a0treatment of\u00a0diverticular disease.\nIf you have not been diagnosed with the condition, contact your GP so they can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as:\n\na stomach ulcer\npancreatitis\ncholecystitis\nbowel cancer\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can also cause similar symptoms to diverticular disease.\n\n\nDiverticular disease is caused by small bulges in the large intestine (diverticula) developing and becoming inflamed. If any of the diverticula become infected, this leads to symptoms of diverticulitis.\nThe exact reason why diverticula develop is not known, but\u00a0they\u00a0are associated with not eating enough fibre.\nFibre makes your stools softer and larger, so less pressure is needed by your large intestine to push them out of your body.\nThe pressure of moving hard, small pieces of stools through your\u00a0large intestine creates weak spots in the outside layer of muscle. This allows the inner layer (mucosa)\u00a0to squeeze through these weak spots, creating the diverticula.\nThere is currently no clinical evidence to fully prove the link between fibre and diverticula. However, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are both much more common in Western countries, where many people do not eat enough fibre.\nDiverticular disease\nIt is not known why only 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0people with diverticula go on to have symptoms of diverticulitis. Diverticular disease may be chronic low-level diverticulitis. The symptoms are very similar to\u00a0irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\u00a0and may overlap.\nHowever,\u00a0factors that appear to increase your risk of developing diverticular disease include:\n\nsmoking\nbeing overweight or obese \nhaving a history of constipation \nuse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0painkillers, such as\u00a0ibuprofen or naproxen\nhaving a close relative with diverticular disease, especially if they developed it under the age of 50\n\nExactly how these lead to developing diverticular disease is unclear.\nDiverticulitis\nDiverticulitis is caused by an infection of one or more of the diverticula.\nIt is thought an infection develops when a hard piece of stool or undigested food\u00a0gets trapped in one of the pouches. This gives bacteria in the stool the chance to multiply and spread, triggering an infection.\n\n\nDiverticular disease can be difficult to diagnose from the symptoms, alone because there are other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nAs a first step, your GP may recommend\u00a0blood tests to rule out other conditions such as\u00a0coeliac disease (a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten) or bowel cancer.\nIn some cases, you may be offered treatment for IBS and diverticular disease at the same time.\nTo make sure there is not a more serious cause of your symptoms, your GP may refer you for a colonoscopy, where a\u00a0thin tube with a camera at the end (a colonoscope) is inserted into your rectum and guided into your colon. Before the procedure begins, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels.\nA colonoscopy is not usually painful,\u00a0but it\u00a0can feel uncomfortable. You may be\u00a0offered painkilling medication\u00a0and a\u00a0sedative beforehand to make you feel more relaxed and help\u00a0reduce any discomfort.\nAnother technique for confirming the presence of diverticula is a computerised tomography (CT scan). A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body.\nAs with a colonoscopy, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels before you have the CT scan.\nUnlike a regular CT scan, the colonography scan involves a tube being inserted into your rectum, which is used to\u00a0pump some air\u00a0up into your rectum. The CT scan is then taken with you lying on your front, and again lying on your back.\nYou may need to have an injection of contrast dye before the scan, but this is not always necessary.\nDiverticulitis\nIf you have had a previous history of diverticular disease, your GP will usually be able to diagnose diverticulitis from your symptoms and a\u00a0physical examination. A blood test may be taken, because a high number of white blood cells indicates infection. If your symptoms are mild, your GP will treat it at home and you should recover within 4\u00a0days.\nFurther tests will be needed if you have no previous history of diverticular disease.\nIf you are unwell, your GP may refer you to hospital for blood tests and investigations. This is to look for complications of diverticulitis and to rule out other possible conditions, such as gallstones or a hernia.\nAn\u00a0ultrasound scan may be used, as well as a CT scan.\nA CT scan may also be used if your symptoms are particularly severe. This is to check whether a complication, such as a perforation or an\u00a0abscess, has occurred.\n\n\nTreatment options for diverticular disease and diverticulitis depend on how severe your symptoms are.\nDiverticular disease\nMost cases of diverticular disease can be treated at home.\nThe over-the-counter painkiller paracetamol is recommended to help relieve your symptoms.\nPainkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are not recommended because they may upset your stomach and increase your risk of internal bleeding.\nEating a high-fibre diet may initially help to control your symptoms. Some people will notice an improvement after a few days, although it can take around a month\u00a0to feel the benefits fully. Read more advice about using diet to improve the symptoms of\u00a0diverticular disease.\nIf you\u00a0have constipation, you may be given a bulk-forming laxative. These can cause flatulence (wind) and bloating. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent any obstruction in your digestive system.\nHeavy or constant rectal bleeding occurs in about 1 in\u00a020 cases of diverticular disease. This can happen if the blood vessels in your large intestine (colon) are weakened by the diverticula, making them vulnerable to damage. The bleeding is usually painless, but losing too much blood can be potentially serious and may need a blood transfusion.\nSigns that you may be experiencing heavy bleeding (aside from the amount of blood) include:\n\nfeeling very dizzy\nmental confusion\npale clammy skin\nshortness of breath\n\nIf you suspect that you (or someone in your care) is experiencing heavy bleeding, seek immediate medical advice. Contact your GP at once. If this is not possible then call NHS 24 111 service or your local out-of-hours service.\nDiverticulitis\nMild diverticulitis can often be treated at home. Your GP will prescribe\u00a0antibiotics for the infection and you should take paracetamol for the pain.\u00a0It's important that you finish the complete course of antibiotics, even if you are feeling better.\nSome types of antibiotics used to treat diverticulitis can cause side effects in some people, including vomiting and diarrhoea.\u00a0\nYour GP may recommend that you stick to a fluid-only diet for a few days until your symptoms improve. This is because trying to digest solid foods may make your symptoms worse. You\u00a0can gradually introduce solid foods over the next 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0days.\nFor the 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0days of recovery, a low-fibre diet is suggested, until you return to the preventative high-fibre diet. This is to reduce the amount of faeces (poo) your large bowel has to\u00a0deal with\u00a0while it is inflamed.\nIf you have not been diagnosed with diverticular disease before, your GP may refer you for a test such as a\u00a0colonoscopy or\u00a0CT colonography\u00a0after the symptoms have settled.\nIf you have more severe diverticulitis, you may need to go to hospital, particularly if:\n\nyour pain cannot be controlled using paracetamol\nyou are unable to drink enough fluids to keep yourself hydrated\nyou are unable to take antibiotics by mouth\u00a0\nyour general state of health is poor\nyou have a weakened immune system\nyour GP suspects complications\nyour symptoms fail to improve after two days of treatment at home\n\nIf you are admitted to hospital for treatment, you are likely\u00a0to receive injections of antibiotics and be kept hydrated and nourished using an intravenous drip (a tube directly connected to your vein). Most people start to improve within 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days.\nSurgery\nIn the past, surgery was recommended as a preventative measure for people who had 2\u00a0episodes of diverticulitis as a precaution to prevent complications.\nThis is no longer the case, as studies have found that in most cases, risks of serious complications from surgery (estimated to be around 1 in 100) usually outweigh the benefits.\nHowever, there are exceptions to this, such as:\n\nif you have a history of serious complications arising from diverticulitis\nif you have\u00a0symptoms of diverticular disease from\u00a0a young age (it is thought the longer you live with diverticular disease, the greater your chances of having a serious complication)\nif you have a weakened immune system or are more vulnerable to\u00a0infections\n\nIf surgery is being considered, discuss both\u00a0benefits and risks carefully with the doctor in charge of your care.\nIn rare cases, a severe episode of diverticulitis can only be treated with emergency surgery. This is when a hole (perforation) has developed in the bowel. This is uncommon, but causes very severe abdominal pain, which needs an emergency trip to hospital.\nSurgery for diverticulitis involves removing the affected section of your\u00a0large intestine. This is known as a colectomy. There are 2\u00a0ways this operation can be performed:\n\nan open colectomy \u2013\u00a0where the surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your abdomen (stomach) and removes a section of your\u00a0large intestine\nlaparoscopic colectomy \u2013 a type of \"keyhole surgery\" where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments\u00a0guided by a camera to remove a section of\u00a0large intestine\n\nOpen colectomies and laparoscopic colectomies are thought equally effective in treating diverticulitis, and have a similar risk of complications. People who have laparoscopic colectomies tend to recover faster and have less pain after the operation.\nEmergency surgery when the bowel has perforated is more likely to be open and may result in a\u00a0stoma being formed (see below).\nIn some cases, the surgeon may decide your\u00a0large intestine needs to heal before it can be reattached, or that too much of your\u00a0large intestine has been removed to make reattachment possible.\nIn such cases, stoma surgery provides a way of removing waste materials from your body without using all of your\u00a0large intestine. It is known as \"having a bag\" as a bag is stuck to the skin on your belly and the faeces (poo) are collected in the bag.\nStoma surgery involves the surgeon making a small hole in your abdomen \u2013 known as a stoma. There are 2\u00a0ways this procedure can be carried out:\u00a0\n\nAn ileostomy \u2013\u00a0where a stoma is made in the right-hand side of your abdomen. Your small intestine is separated from your\u00a0large intestine and connected to the stoma, and the rest of the\u00a0large intestine is sealed. You will need to wear a pouch connected to the stoma to collect waste material (poo).\nA colostomy \u2013\u00a0where a stoma is made in your lower abdomen and a section of your\u00a0large intestine is removed and connected to the stoma. As with an ileostomy, you will need to wear a pouch to collect waste material.\n\nIn most cases, the stoma will be temporary and can be removed once your\u00a0large intestine has recovered from the surgery. This will depend on the situation when you had the operation. If it was an emergency operation, you may need a few months to recover before having surgery to reverse the stoma.\nIf a large section of your\u00a0large intestine is affected by diverticulitis and needs to be removed, or if you have multiple other conditions that make major surgery a risk, you may need a permanent ileostomy or colostomy.\nIn general terms, elective (non-emergency) surgery is usually successful, although it does not achieve a complete cure in all cases. Following surgery, an estimated 1 in 12 people will have a recurrence of symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.\u00a0\nIn an emergency setting, the success rate depends on how unwell you are when you require the operation.\n\n\nComplications of diverticulitis affect 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0people with the condition. Those most at risk are aged under 50.\nSome complications associated with diverticulitis are discussed below.\nBleeding\nAround 15% of people with diverticular disease or diverticulitis experience bleeding,\u00a0which is usually painless, quick and resolves itself in 70-80% of cases.\nHowever,\u00a0if the bleeding does not resolve itself,\u00a0an emergency\u00a0blood transfusion may be required due to excessive bleeding. If the bleeding is severe, you may need to be admitted to hospital\u00a0for monitoring.\nUrinary problems\nDiverticulitis can lead to the inflamed part of the bowel\u00a0being in contact with\u00a0the bladder.\u00a0This may\u00a0cause urinary problems, such as:\n\npain when urinating (dysuria)\nneeding to urinate more often than usual\nin rare cases, air in the urine\n\nAbscess\nThe most common complication of diverticulitis is an abscess outside the large intestine (colon). An abscess is a pus-filled cavity or lump in the tissue. Abscesses are usually treated with a technique known as percutaneous abscess drainage (PAD).\nA radiologist (a specialist in the use of imaging equipment, such as computerised tomography (CT) scans) uses an ultrasound or CT scanner to locate the site of the abscess.\nA fine needle connected to a small tube is passed through the skin of your abdomen (stomach) and into the abscess. The tube is then used to drain the pus from the abscess. A PAD is performed under a local anaesthetic.\nDepending on the size of the abscess, the procedure may need repeating several times before all\u00a0the pus has been drained. If the abscess is very small \u2013 usually less than 4cm (1.5in) \u2013 it may be possible to treat it using antibiotics.\nFistula\nA\u00a0fistula is another\u00a0common complication of diverticulitis. Fistulas are abnormal tunnels that connect 2\u00a0parts of the body together, such as your intestine and your abdominal wall or bladder.\nIf infected tissues come into contact with each other, they can stick together. After the tissues have healed, a fistula may form. Fistulas can be potentially serious as they can allow bacteria in your large intestine to travel to other parts of your body, triggering infections, such as an infection of the bladder (cystitis).\nFistulas are usually treated with surgery to remove the section of the colon that contains the fistula.\nPeritonitis\nIn rare cases, an infected diverticulum (pouch in your colon) can split, spreading the infection into the lining of your abdomen (perforation). An infection of the lining of the abdomen is known as peritonitis.\nPeritonitis can be life-threatening, and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Surgery may also be required to\u00a0drain any pus that has built up, and it may be necessary to perform a colostomy.\nIntestinal obstruction\nIf the infection has badly scarred your\u00a0large intestine, it may become partially or totally blocked. A totally blocked\u00a0large intestine is a medical emergency because the tissue of your\u00a0large intestine will start to decay and eventually split, leading to peritonitis.\nA partially blocked\u00a0large intestine is not as urgent, but treatment is still needed. If left untreated, it will affect your ability to digest food and cause you considerable pain.\nIntestinal blockage from diverticular disease is very rare. Other causes, such as cancer, are more common. This is one of the reasons your GP will investigate your symptoms.\nIn some cases, the blocked part\u00a0can be removed during\u00a0surgery.\nHowever, if the scarring and blockage is more extensive, a temporary or permanent\u00a0colostomy may be needed.\n\n\nEating a high-fibre diet may help prevent diverticular disease, and should improve your symptoms.\nYour diet should be balanced and include at least 5\u00a0portions of fruit and vegetables a day, plus whole grains. Adults should aim to eat 18g (0.6oz) to 30g (1.05oz) of fibre a day, depending on their height and weight. Your GP can provide a more specific target, based on your individual height and weight.\nIt's recommended that you gradually increase your fibre intake over the course of a few weeks. This will help prevent side effects associated with a high-fibre diet, such as bloating and flatulence (wind). Drinking plenty of fluids will also help prevent side effects.\nIf you have established diverticular disease, it may be suggested that you avoid\u00a0eating\u00a0nuts, corn and seeds\u00a0due to\u00a0the possibility that\u00a0they could block the diverticular openings and cause diverticulitis. People usually find out themselves if these foods cause symptoms. Probiotics have also been recommended, but evidence is lacking.

The type of dysphagia you have can usually be diagnosed after testing your swallowing ability and examining your oesophagus.\nMany cases of dysphagia can be improved with treatment, but a cure isn't always possible. Treatments for dysphagia include:\n\nspeech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques\u00a0\nchanging the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow\nalternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach\nsurgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent)\n\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing dysphagia and treating dysphagia.\nComplications of dysphagia\nDysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. One of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food\u00a0goes down the \"wrong way\" and blocks your airway.\nIf this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking\u00a0because you fear\u00a0choking, which\u00a0can lead to malnutrition and dehydration.\nSome people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspiration pneumonia, which require medical treatment.\nDysphagia can also affect your quality of life\u00a0as it may prevent\u00a0you enjoying meals and social occasions.\nRead more about the\u00a0complications of dysphagia.\n\n\nAs swallowing is a complex process, there are many reasons why dysphagia can develop.\nSome causes of dysphagia are explained below.\nNeurological causes\nThe nervous system is made up of the brain, nerves and spinal cord. Damage to the nervous system can interfere with the nerves responsible for starting and controlling swallowing. This can lead to dysphagia.\nSome neurological causes of dysphagia include:\n\na stroke\u00a0\nneurological conditions that cause damage to the brain and nervous system over time,\u00a0including Parkinson's disease,\u00a0multiple sclerosis, dementia,\u00a0and motor neurone disease\nbrain tumours\nmyasthenia gravis\u00a0\u2013 a rare condition that causes your muscles to become weak\n\nCongenital and developmental conditions\nThe term \"congenital\" refers to something you're born with. Developmental conditions affect the way you develop.\nCongenital or developmental conditions that may cause dysphagia include:\u00a0\n\nlearning disabilities\u00a0\u2013 where learning, understanding, and communicating are difficult\ncerebral palsy\u00a0\u2013 a group of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination\na cleft lip\u00a0and\u00a0palate\u00a0\u2013 a common birth defect that results in a gap or split in the upper lip or roof of the mouth\n\nObstruction\nConditions that cause an obstruction in the throat or a narrowing of the oesophagus\u00a0(the tube that carries food from your mouth to the stomach)\u00a0can make swallowing difficult.\nSome causes of obstruction and narrowing include:\n\nmouth cancer or throat cancer, such as laryngeal cancer or oesophageal cancer \u2013 once these cancers are treated, the obstruction may no longer be an issue\npharyngeal (throat) pouches, also known as Zenker diverticulum \u2013 where a large sac develops in the upper part of the oesophagus, which reduces the ability to swallow both liquids and solids;\u00a0it's a rare condition that mainly affects older people\neosinophilic oesophagitis \u2013\u00a0where a type of white blood cell known as an eosinophil\u00a0builds up in the lining of the oesophagus as the result of a reaction to foods, allergens, or acid reflux; the build-up damages the lining of the oesophagus and causes swallowing difficulties\nradiotherapy treatment \u2013 this\u00a0can cause scar tissue, which narrows the passageway in your throat and oesophagus\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease\u00a0(GORD)\u00a0\u2013 stomach acid can cause scar tissue to develop, narrowing your oesophagus\u00a0\ninfections, such as tuberculosis or thrush\u00a0\u2013 these\u00a0can lead to inflammation of the oesophagus (oesophagitis)\n\nMuscular conditions\nAny condition that affects the muscles used to push food down the oesophagus and into the stomach can cause dysphagia,\u00a0although\u00a0such conditions are rare.\n2\u00a0muscular conditions associated with dysphagia are:\n\nscleroderma\u00a0\u2013 where the immune system (the body's natural defence system) attacks healthy tissue, leading to a stiffening of the throat and oesophagus muscles\nachalasia \u2013 where muscles in the oesophagus lose their ability to relax and open to allow food or liquid to enter the stomach\n\nOther causes\nAs you get older, the\u00a0muscles\u00a0used for swallowing can become weaker. This may explain why dysphagia is relatively common\u00a0in elderly people. Treatment is available to help people with age-related dysphagia.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\u00a0(COPD) is a collection of lung conditions that make it difficult to breathe in and out properly. Breathing difficulties can sometimes affect your ability to swallow.\nDysphagia can also sometimes develop as a complication of head or neck\u00a0surgery.\n\n\nSee your GP if you're having any difficulty swallowing. They'll carry out an initial assessment and may refer you for further tests and treatment.\nTests will help determine whether your dysphagia is\u00a0the result of\u00a0a problem with your mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or \"high\" dysphagia), or your oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (oesophageal, or \"low\" dysphagia).\nDiagnosing the specific type of dysphagia can make treatment more effective and reduce your chances of developing complications of dysphagia, such as choking or pneumonia.\nYour GP will want to know:\n\nhow long you've had dysphagia\nwhether your symptoms come and go, or are getting worse\nwhether dysphagia has affected your ability to swallow solids, liquids, or both\nwhether you've lost weight\n\nSpecialist referral\nDepending on the suspected cause,\u00a0you may be referred for further tests with:\u00a0\n\nan ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist\u00a0\na speech and language therapist (SLT)\na neurologist\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in conditions that affect the brain, nerves, and spinal cord\na gastroenterologist\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in treating conditions of the gullet, stomach, and intestines\na geriatrician\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in the care of elderly people\n\nThe types of tests you might need are explained below.\nA water swallow test\u00a0is usually carried out by a speech and language therapist, and\u00a0can\u00a0give a good initial assessment of your swallowing abilities. You'll be given 150ml of water and asked to swallow it as quickly as possible.\nThe time\u00a0it takes you to drink all of the water and the number of swallows required will be recorded. You may also be asked to swallow a soft piece of pudding or fruit.\nA videofluoroscopy, or modified barium swallow, is one of the most effective ways of assessing your swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problem is.\nAn X-ray\u00a0machine records a continuous moving X-ray on to video, allowing your swallowing problems to be studied in detail.\nYou'll be asked to swallow different types of food and drink of different consistencies, mixed with a non-toxic liquid called barium that shows up on X-rays.\nA videofluoroscopy usually takes about 30 minutes. You may feel sick after the test, and the barium may cause constipation. Your stools may also be white for a few days as the barium passes through your system.\nA nasendoscopy, sometimes also known as fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES),\u00a0is a procedure that allows the nose and upper airways to be closely examined using\u00a0a very small flexible tube known as an endoscope.\nThe endoscope is inserted into your nose so the specialist can look down on to your throat and upper airways. It has a light and camera at the end so images of the throat can be viewed on a television screen. This allows any blockages or problem areas to be identified.\nFEES can also be used to test for oropharyngeal dysphagia after you're asked to swallow a small amount of test liquid (usually coloured water or milk).\nBefore the procedure, you may have\u00a0local anaesthetic spray into your nose, but because the camera doesn't go as far as your throat, it doesn't cause retching. The procedure is safe and usually only takes a few minutes.\nRead more about endoscopy.\nManometry is a procedure to assess the function of your oesophagus. It involves passing a small\u00a0tube (catheter) with pressure sensors through your nose and into your oesophagus to monitor its function.\nThe test measures the pressures\u00a0within your\u00a0oesophagus when you swallow, which determines how well it's working.\nThe 24-hour pH study involves inserting a tube into your oesophagus through your nose to measure the amount of acid that flows back from your stomach. This\u00a0can help determine the cause of any swallowing difficulties.\nDiagnostic gastroscopy, also known as diagnostic endoscopy of the stomach,\u00a0or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), is an internal examination using an endoscope.\nThe endoscope\u00a0is passed down your throat and into your oesophagus, and images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen. It can often detect cancerous growths or scar tissue.\nRead more about treating dysphagia.\nNutritional assessment\nIf dysphagia has affected your ability to eat, you may need a nutritional assessment to check that you're not\u00a0lacking nutrients (malnourished). This could involve:\n\nmeasuring your weight\ncalculating your\u00a0body mass index (BMI) to check whether you're a healthy weight for your height\u00a0\ncarrying out\u00a0blood tests\n\n\n\nMost swallowing problems can be treated, although the treatment you receive will depend on the type of dysphagia you have.\nTreatment will depend on whether your swallowing problem\u00a0is in the mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or \"high\" dysphagia), or in the oesophagus (oesophageal, or \"low\" dysphagia).\nThe cause of dysphagia is also considered when deciding on treatment. In some cases, treating the underlying cause, such as mouth cancer or oesophageal cancer,\u00a0can help relieve swallowing problems.\nTreatment for dysphagia may be managed by a\u00a0group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Your MDT may include\u00a0a speech and language therapist (SLT), a surgeon, and a dietitian.\nHigh (oropharyngeal) dysphagia\nHigh dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the mouth or throat.\nIt can be difficult to treat if it's caused by a condition that\u00a0affects the nervous system.\u00a0This is because these problems can't usually be corrected using medication or surgery.\nThere are 3\u00a0main treatments\u00a0for high dysphagia:\n\nswallowing therapy\ndietary changes\u00a0\nfeeding tubes\n\nYou may be referred to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for swallowing therapy if you have high dysphagia.\nAn SLT is a healthcare professional trained to work with people with feeding or swallowing difficulties.\nSLTs use a range of techniques that can be tailored\u00a0for your specific problem, such as\u00a0teaching you swallowing exercises.\nYou may be referred to a dietitian (specialist in nutrition)\u00a0for advice about changes to your diet to make sure\u00a0you receive a healthy, balanced diet.\nAn SLT\u00a0can give you advice about\u00a0softer foods and thickened fluids that you may find easier to swallow. They may also try to ensure you're getting the support you need at meal times.\nFeeding tubes can be used to provide nutrition while you're recovering your ability to swallow. They may also be required in severe cases of dysphagia that put you at risk of\u00a0malnutrition and\u00a0dehydration.\nA feeding tube\u00a0can also make it easier for you to take the medication you may need for other conditions.\nThere are 2\u00a0types of feeding tubes:\n\na nasogastric tube \u2013 a tube that is passed down your nose and into your stomach\na percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube \u2013\u00a0a tube that is implanted directly into your stomach\n\nNasogastric tubes are designed for short-term use. The tube will need to be replaced and swapped to the other nostril after about a month. PEG tubes are designed for long-term use and last several months before they need to be replaced.\nMost people with dysphagia prefer to use a PEG tube because it can be hidden under clothing. However, they carry a greater risk of complications compared\u00a0with nasogastric tubes.\nMinor complications of PEG tubes include tube displacement, skin infection, and a blocked or leaking tube. 2\u00a0major complications of PEG tubes are infection and internal bleeding.\nResuming normal feeding may be more difficult with a PEG tube compared with using a nasogastric tube. The convenience of PEG tubes can make people less willing to carry out swallowing exercises and dietary changes than those who\u00a0use nasogastric tubes.\nYou should discuss the pros and cons of both types of feeding tubes with your treatment team.\nLow (oesophageal) dysphagia\nLow dysphagia is swallowing difficulties\u00a0caused by\u00a0problems with the oesophagus.\nDepending on the cause of low dysphagia, it may be possible to treat it with medication. For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used to treat indigestion may improve symptoms caused by narrowing or scarring of the oesophagus.\u00a0\nBotulinum toxin\u00a0can sometimes be used to treat achalasia. This is a condition where the muscles in the oesophagus become too stiff to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach.\nIt can be used to paralyse the tightened muscles that prevent food from reaching the stomach. However, the effects only last for around 6\u00a0months.\nSurgery\nOther cases of low dysphagia can usually be treated with surgery.\nEndoscopic dilation is widely used to treat dysphagia caused by obstruction. It\u00a0can also be used to stretch your\u00a0oesophagus if it's scarred.\nEndoscopic dilatation will be carried out during an\u00a0internal examination of your oesophagus (gastroscopy)\u00a0using an endoscopy.\nAn endoscope is passed down your throat and into your\u00a0oesophagus, and\u00a0images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen.\nUsing the image as guidance, a small balloon or a bougie (a thin, flexible medical instrument) is passed through the narrowed part of your oesophagus to widen it. If a balloon is used, it will be gradually inflated to widen your oesophagus before being deflated and removed.\nYou may be given a mild sedative before the procedure to relax you. There's a small risk that the procedure\u00a0could cause a tear or perforate your\u00a0oesophagus.\nFind out more about gastroscopy.\nIf you have\u00a0oesophageal cancer\u00a0that can't be removed, it's usually recommended that you have a\u00a0stent inserted instead of endoscopic dilatation. This is because, if you have cancer,\u00a0there's a higher risk of perforating your oesophagus if it's stretched.\nA stent (usually a metal mesh tube)\u00a0is inserted\u00a0into your\u00a0oesophagus during an endoscopy or under X-ray\u00a0guidance.\nThe stent then gradually expands to create a passage wide enough to allow food to pass through. You'll need to follow a particular diet to keep the stent open without having\u00a0blockages.\nCongenital dysphagia\nIf your baby is born with difficulty swallowing (congenital dysphagia), their treatment will depend on the cause.\nDysphagia caused by cerebral palsy\u00a0can be treated with speech and language therapy. Your child will be taught how to swallow, how to adjust the type of food they eat, and how to use feeding tubes.\u00a0\nCleft lip and palate\u00a0is a facial birth defect that can cause dysphagia. It's usually treated with surgery.\u00a0\nNarrowing of the oesophagus may be treated with a type of surgery called dilatation to widen the oesophagus.\u00a0\nDysphagia caused by\u00a0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\u00a0can be treated using special thickened feeds instead of your usual breast or formula milk. Sometimes medication may also be used.\nBreastfeeding or bottle feeding\nIf you're having difficulty bottle feeding or breastfeeding your baby, see your midwife, health visitor or GP\n\n\nThe main complication of dysphagia is coughing and choking, which can lead to pneumonia.\nCoughing and choking\nIf you have dysphagia, there's a risk of food, drink or saliva going down the \"wrong way\". It can block your airway, making it difficult to breathe and causing you to cough or choke.\nFor more information and advice, see What should I do if someone is choking?.\nIf you have dysphagia, you may also\u00a0develop a fear of choking. However, it's very important\u00a0you don't avoid\u00a0eating and drinking, as it could cause dehydration and malnutrition.\nIf you often choke on your food\u00a0because of\u00a0dysphagia, you may also be at an increased risk of developing a\u00a0condition called aspiration pneumonia.\nAspiration pneumonia\nAspiration pneumonia is a chest infection that can develop after accidentally inhaling something, such as a small piece of food. It causes irritation in the lungs, or damages them. Older people are particularly at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.\nThe symptoms of aspiration pneumonia include:\n\na cough \u2013 this may be a dry\u00a0cough, or you may produce phlegm that's yellow, green, brown, or bloodstained\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or over\nchest pain\ndifficulty breathing \u2013 your breathing may be rapid and shallow and you may feel breathless, even at rest\n\nContact your treatment team\u00a0immediately if you're being treated for dysphagia and you develop these symptoms. If this isn't possible, contact your local\u00a0out-of-hours service or call NHS 24 111 service.\nSymptoms of aspiration pneumonia can range from mild to severe, and it is usually treated with antibiotics. Severe cases will require hospital admission and treatment with intravenous antibiotics (through a drip). Read more about\u00a0treating pneumonia.\nIn particularly old or\u00a0frail people, there's a chance the infection could lead to their lungs becoming filled with fluid, preventing them working properly. This is known as\u00a0acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nYour chances of developing pneumonia as a result of\u00a0dysphagia are higher if you have\u00a0a weakened immune system,\u00a0chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or if your oral and dental hygiene is poor.\nDysphagia in children\nIf children with long-term dysphagia\u00a0aren't eating enough, they may not get the essential nutrients they need for physical and mental development.\nChildren who have difficulty eating may also find meal times stressful, which may lead to behavioural problems.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, is the inability to get and maintain an erection.\nErectile dysfunction\u00a0is a very common condition, particularly in older men.

The nerves increase the blood flow to the penis, causing the tissue to expand and harden.\nAnything that interferes with the nervous system or the blood circulation could lead to\u00a0erectile dysfunction.\nAnything that affects the level of sexual desire (libido)\u00a0can also cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction because a reduced libido makes it more difficult for the brain to trigger an erection. Psychological conditions, such as depression, can reduce libido, as can changes in hormone levels (chemicals produced by the body).\nPhysical causes\nThere are four main types of health conditions that can cause physical problems resulting in\u00a0erectile dysfunction. These are:\n\nconditions affecting the flow of blood to your penis\u00a0\u2013 vasculogenic\nconditions affecting your nervous system, which is made up of your brain, nerves and spinal cord \u2013 neurogenic\nconditions affecting your hormone levels \u2013 hormonal\nconditions affecting the physical structure of your penis\u00a0\u2013 anatomical\n\nPenis injuries or surgical treatment of the penis, pelvis or surrounding areas can sometimes lead to erectile dysfunction.\nErectile dysfunction is also thought to occur in up to 15-25% of people who\u00a0experience a severe head injury.\nExamples of vasculogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include:\n\ncardiovascular disease\u00a0\u2013 a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)\u00a0\nhigh blood pressure\u00a0(hypertension)\ndiabetes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition caused by high blood sugar levels. This can affect both the blood supply and the nerve endings in your penis, so it is also a neurogenic condition\n\nErectile dysfunction\u00a0is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. For this reason, it may be one of the first causes your GP considers when\u00a0making a diagnosis\u00a0and planning your treatment.\nExamples of neurogenic conditions that cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction include:\n\nmultiple sclerosis\u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the body's actions, such as movement and balance\u00a0\nParkinson\u2019s disease\u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the way that the brain coordinates body movements, including walking, talking and writing\na spinal injury or disorder\na\u00a0stroke\u00a0\u2013 a serious condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted\n\nExamples of hormonal conditions that cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction include:\n\nhypogonadism\u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the production of the male sex hormone, testosterone, causing abnormally low levels\u00a0\nan\u00a0overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\u00a0\u2013 where too much thyroid hormone is produced\nan\u00a0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) \u2013 where not enough thyroid hormone is produced\u00a0\nCushing's syndrome\u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the production of a hormone called cortisol\n\nPeyronie's disease, which affects the tissue of the penis, is an example of an anatomical condition that can cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction.\nMedicine\u00a0\nIn some men,\u00a0certain medicines can cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction, including:\n\ndiuretics \u2013 these increase the production of urine and are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure and kidney disease\u00a0\nantihypertensives\u00a0\u2013 such as beta-blockers, that are used to treat high blood pressure\nfibrates\u00a0\u2013 medicines used to lower\u00a0cholesterol levels\nantipsychotics\u00a0\u2013 used to treat some mental health conditions, such as\u00a0schizophrenia\u00a0\nantidepressants\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 used to treat depression and some types of pain\ncorticosteroids\u00a0\u2013 medication that contains steroids, which are a type of hormone\nH2-antagonists\u00a0\u2013 medicines used to treat stomach ulcers\nanticonvulsants\u00a0\u2013 used to treat\u00a0epilepsy\nantihistamines \u2013\u00a0used to treat allergic health conditions, such as\u00a0hay fever\nanti-androgens\u00a0\u2013 medication that suppresses androgens (male sex hormones)\u00a0\ncytotoxics\u00a0\u2013 medication used in chemotherapy to prevent cancer cells from dividing and growing\n\nSpeak to your GP if you are concerned that a prescribed medicine is causing erectile dysfunction. Alternative medication may be available. However,\u00a0it is important never to\u00a0stop taking a prescribed medicine unless you are advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.\nPsychological causes\nPossible psychological causes of\u00a0erectile dysfunction include:\n\ndepression\u00a0\u2013 feelings of extreme sadness that last for a long time\nanxiety\u00a0\u2013 a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear\n\nErectile dysfunction can often have both physical and psychological causes. For example, if you have diabetes, it may be difficult for you to get an erection, which may cause you to become anxious about the situation. The combination of diabetes and anxiety may lead to an episode of erectile dysfunction.\nThere are\u00a0many emotional issues that may also affect your physical ability to get or maintain an erection. These include:\n\nrelationship problems\nlack of sexual knowledge\npast sexual problems\npast sexual abuse\nbeing in a new relationship\u00a0\n\nOther causes\nOther possible causes of\u00a0erectile dysfunction\u00a0include:\n\nexcessive alcohol intake\u00a0\ntiredness\nusing illegal drugs, such as cannabis, heroin or cocaine\n\nMen who cycle for more than three hours per week may be recommended to try a period without cycling to see if this helps improve erectile dysfunction.\nRiding in the correct position with a properly fitted seat may also help to prevent regular cycling from leading to erectile dysfunction.\n\n\nErectile dysfunction (ED) can often be diagnosed by your GP. They will talk to you about your situation and may carry out a physical examination.\nYour GP may ask you about:\n\nyour symptoms\nyour overall physical and mental health\nyour alcohol consumption\nwhether you take drugs\nwhether you are currently taking any medication\n\nIf you do not want to talk to your GP about erectile dysfunction, you can visit a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. You can find your nearest GUM clinic on the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV\u00a0(BASHH) website.\nSexual history\nYou'll also be asked\u00a0about your sexual history. Try not to be embarrassed because\u00a0erectile dysfunction is a common problem.\u00a0You can request a male GP at your surgery if you prefer.\nYou may be asked about:\n\nyour previous and current sexual relationships\u00a0\nwhat your sexual orientation is\u00a0\nhow long you have been experiencing erectile dysfunction\nwhether you can get any degree of erection with your partner, on your own or when you wake up in the morning\u00a0\nwhether you have been able to ejaculate or orgasm\nyour libido (your level of sexual desire)\n\nErectile dysfunction\u00a0that\u00a0happens all the time may suggest an underlying physical cause.\nErectile dysfunction that\u00a0only occurs when you are attempting to have sex may suggest an underlying psychological (mental) cause.\nAssessing your cardiovascular health\nYour GP may assess your cardiovascular health. Narrowed blood vessels are a common cause of erectile dysfunction and linked with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart and blood flow).\nYour GP may:\n\nmeasure your blood pressure to see if you have\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension)\nlisten to your heart rate to check for any abnormalities\nmeasure your height, weight and waist circumference to see if you are a healthy weight for your height\u00a0\nask you about your diet and lifestyle, for example, how much exercise you do\ntest a sample of your blood for glucose (sugar) and lipids (fatty substances), as high levels can indicate conditions affecting your heart or blood vessels\n\nPhysical examinations and tests\nA\u00a0physical examination of your penis may be carried out\u00a0to rule out anatomical causes (conditions that affect the physical structure of your penis).\nIf you have symptoms of an enlarged prostate, such as weak or irregular urination, a\u00a0digital rectal examination (DRE) may be suggested.\u00a0\nBlood tests\u00a0can also\u00a0check for underlying health conditions. For example, measuring the levels of hormones such as testosterone can rule out hormonal conditions, such as hypogonadism (an abnormally low level of testosterone).\nFurther testing\nIn some cases you may be referred to a specialist for further testing. This might be the case if you\u00a0are unusually young to be experiencing\u00a0erectile dysfunction as it's rare in men under 40 years of age.\u00a0\nAn intracavernous injection test involves injecting a man-made (synthetic) hormone into your penis to increase the blood flow. This helps\u00a0assess any\u00a0abnormalities in your penis and plan surgery.\u00a0\nIf the injection doesn't result in an\u00a0erection it may indicate a problem with the blood supply to your penis. In some cases, you may also need an ultrasound scan.\nThese specialised tests involve injecting dye into the blood vessels of your penis and studying the dye on a scanner. These are likely to be used if you are being considered for surgery or if a problem has been detected with your blood vessels.\nPsychological assessment\nIf the cause of your erectile dysfunction is thought to be psychological, you may be reffered\u00a0for a psychological assessment.\n\n\nIf you have erectile dysfunction (ED), treatment will depend on what's causing it. The various treatments for erectile dysfunction are outlined below.\u00a0\nTreating underlying conditions\nIf your\u00a0erectile dysfunction is caused by an underlying health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes, that condition may need to be treated first. In some cases, treating the underlying cause may also resolve the problem.\nIf you are taking medication that can cause erectile dysfunction, there may be an alternative. It is important never to stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care.\nLifestyle changes\nErectile dysfunction can often be improved by making changes to your lifestyle, such as:\n\nlosing weight if you are overweight\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\ngiving up smoking\ncutting back\u00a0your alcohol\u00a0consumption\u00a0\nnot taking illegal drugs\u00a0\nexercising regularly\u00a0\nreducing\u00a0stress\u00a0\n\nAs well as helping to improve your\u00a0erectile dysfunction, these changes can also improve your general health and may help to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels).\nRead more about\u00a0preventing cardiovascular disease\u00a0\u00a0\nPhosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are one of the most widely used and effective types of medication for treating erectile dysfunction. They work by temporarily increasing the blood flow to your penis.\nIn England,\u00a0four PDE-5 inhibitors are available for treating erectile dysfunction. They are:\n\nsildenafil\u00a0\u2013 sold under the brand name Viagra\u00a0\ntadalafil\u00a0\u2013 sold under the brand name Cialis\nvardenafil\u00a0\u2013 sold under the brand name Levitra\navanafil\u00a0\u2013 sold under the brand name Spedra\n\nSildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil work for about eight hours and they are designed to work 'on demand'. Tadalafil lasts for up to 36 hours and is more suitable if you require treatment for a longer period of time, for example, over a weekend.\nDepending on the type of PDE-5 inhibitor you are taking and the dose, it should take about 30-60 minutes before it starts to work. With sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil, you should be able to have sex from one to 10 hours after taking the medicine. After taking tadalafil, the effects will last for up to 36 hours.\nIt may take longer to notice the effects if the tablet is taken with food, so it's best to take it on an empty stomach. You can then eat after an hour without affecting the medicine.\nOnly take one tablet within a 24-hour period.\nYour GP should explain the benefits of each medication and how it works. The choice may depend on:\n\nhow often you are sexually active\u00a0\nwhether you have tried any of the medications before\n\nThere have been many studies to test the effectiveness of these medications. In general,\u00a0at least\u00a0two-thirds of men report having improved erections after taking one of these medicines.\nIf you do not find that PDE-5 inhibitors are effective it may be because:\n\nyou have not waited long enough after taking the dose\nyou have waited too long after taking the dose\nthe dose is not high enough\nyou have not had enough sexual stimulation\n\nThese medications are triggered by sexual stimulation, so you also need to be aroused for it to work.\nPDE-5 inhibitors should be used\u00a0with caution in men who have cardiovascular disease, such as coronary heart disease. However, sexual activity is also likely to be beneficial for your cardiovascular health. You should discuss the risks and benefits with your GP.\nPDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who have anatomical problems with their penis, such as Peyronie's disease (a condition that affects the tissue of the penis).\nPDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who:\n\nare at risk of priapism\u00a0\u2013 a painful erection that lasts for several hours\nare also taking long lasting alpha-blockers \u2013 a medication used to treat a number of conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension)\n\nDo not take PDE-5 inhibitors if you are also taking medicines or recreational drugs that contain nitrates. The combination of the two substances can have a dangerous effect on your heart.\nOrganic nitrates are often used to treat angina, and butyl nitrate is a recreational drug that is more commonly known as 'poppers'.\nYou\u00a0are\u00a0also\u00a0warned\u00a0not to take PDE-5 inhibitors if you:\n\nhave been advised not to take part in sexual activity or in activities that widen your blood vessels\u00a0\nhave\u00a0low blood pressure (hypotension)\u00a0\nhave recently had a\u00a0stroke\u00a0\u2013 a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted\nhave unstable\u00a0angina\u00a0\u2013 an underlying heart condition that causes symptoms such as chest pain\nhave had a\u00a0heart attack\u00a0\u2013 a medical emergency where the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked\nhave a history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy\u00a0\u2013 an eye condition that causes a sudden loss of vision\n\nPDE-5 inhibitors can cause some side effects, including:\n\nheadaches and migraines\nflushing (redness)\u00a0\nindigestion\nnausea (feeling sick)\nvomiting (being sick)\na blocked or runny nose\nback pain\nvision disturbances\nmuscle pain\n\nVacuum pumps\nA vacuum pump consists of a clear plastic tube that is connected to a pump, which is either hand or battery operated.\nYou place your penis in the tube and pump out all of the air. This creates a vacuum that causes the blood to fill your penis, making it erect. You then place a rubber ring around the base of your penis to keep the blood in place, allowing you to maintain an erection for around 30 minutes.\nIt may take several attempts to learn how to use the pump correctly, but they are usually effective. After using a vacuum pump,\u00a0nine out of 10 men are able to have sex, regardless of the cause of their ED.\nYou should not use a vacuum pump if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are taking anticoagulant medicines, which reduce the ability of your blood to clot.\nSide effects of vacuum pumps include pain or bruising, although these occur in less than a third of men.\nMen who qualify for NHS prescriptions for erectile dysfunction treatments may be able to get a vacuum pump on the NHS (see above for more details). However,\u00a0some men will need to buy one.\nThe\u00a0Sexual Advice Association produces a number of factsheets, including one on vacuum pumps\u00a0that provides details of companies that supply them.\nAlprostadil\nIf your\u00a0erectile dysfunction doesn't\u00a0respond to treatment, or you are unable or unwilling to use PDE-5 inhibitors or a vacuum pump, you may be given a medicine called alprostadil. This is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that helps to stimulate blood flow to the penis.\nAlprostadil is available as:\n\nan injection directly into your penis\u00a0\u2013 this is called an intracavernosal injection\na small pellet placed inside your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the tip of your penis)\u00a0\u2013 this is called urethral application\n\nYou may be trained to correctly inject or insert alprostadil. If your partner is pregnant,\u00a0use a condom during sex if you are inserting alprostadil into your urethra.\nAlprostadil will usually produce an erection after five to 15 minutes. How long the erection lasts will depend on the dose.\nIn men who did not respond to PDE-5 inhibitors, alprostadil injections were successful in 85 out of 100 men. Alprostadil inserted into the urethra is successful for up to two-thirds of men.\nAlprostadil should not be used:\n\nin\u00a0men at risk of priapism (a painful erection that lasts for several hours)\u00a0\u2013 for example, those with sickle cell anaemia\nalongside other\u00a0erectile dysfunction medications\u00a0\nif you have a penile implant or if you have been advised to avoid sexual activity\u00a0\n\nUrethral application may also not be used in:\n\nsome\u00a0men who have anatomical problems with their penis (conditions that affect the physical structure of the penis)\u00a0\nmen who have infections of their penis, such as\u00a0balantis\u00a0(inflammation of the head of the penis)\n\nAlprostadil can cause some side effects including:\n\nchanges in your blood pressure\ndizziness\nheadache\npain in your penis\u00a0\nurethral burning or bleeding\nreactions at the site of the injection, such as swelling\n\nAs with PDE-5 inhibitors, NHS prescriptions for alprostadil may only be available for\u00a0men with particular health conditions or those receiving some types of medical treatments. If you need to pay the full prescription cost, a single injection of alprostadil costs around \u00a38 to \u00a322, depending on the dose. A single dose of alprostadil for urethral application is around \u00a310.\u00a0\nHormone therapy\nIf a hormonal condition is causing\u00a0erectile dysfunction, you may be referred to an endocrinologist (who specialises in the treatment of hormonal conditions).\nHormones are chemicals produced by the body. Many hormonal conditions can be treated using injections of synthetic (man-made) hormones to restore normal hormone levels.\nSurgery\nSurgery for\u00a0erectile dysfunction is usually only recommended if all other treatment methods have failed. It may also be considered in:\n\nyounger men who have experienced serious injury to their pelvic area\u00a0\u2013 for example, in a car accident\nmen with a significant anatomical problem with their penis\n\nIn the past, surgery was used if there was clear evidence of a blockage to the blood supply of the penis. The surgeon could unblock the blood vessels to restore a normal supply of blood. However, research now suggests that the long-term results of this type of surgery are poor, so it's unlikely to be used.\nPenile implants are a type of surgery that may be considered. These can be:\n\nsemi-rigid implants \u2013 which may be suitable for older men who do not have sex regularly\ninflatable implants \u2013 which consist of two or three parts that can be inflated to give a more natural erection\n\nPenile implants are not usually available on the NHS and inflatable implants may be very expensive. However, around three-quarters of men report being satisfied with the results of this type of surgery.\nAs with all types of surgery, having penile implants inserted\u00a0carries a risk of infection. If you take preventative antibiotics, the rate of infection is around\u00a0two\u00a0or three\u00a0in 100. Mechanical problems with the implants may occur within five years in\u00a0five\u00a0per cent of\u00a0cases.\u00a0\nPsychological treatments\nIf your\u00a0erectile dysfunction has an underlying psychological cause then you may benefit from a type of treatment called sensate focus.\nIf conditions such as anxiety or depression are causing your\u00a0erectile dysfunction, you may benefit from\u00a0counselling\u00a0(a talking therapy).\nSensate focus is a type of sex therapy that you and your partner complete together. It starts with you\u00a0both agreeing not to have sex for a number of weeks or months. During this time, you can still touch each other, but not in the genital area (or a woman\u2019s breasts). The idea is to explore your bodies knowing that you will not have sex.\nAfter the agreed period of time has passed, you can gradually begin touching each other\u2019s genital areas. You can also begin to use your mouth to touch your partner, for example, licking or kissing, them. This can build up to include penetrative sex.\nYou can find out more about sensate focus from the College\u00a0of\u00a0Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT).\nPsychosexual counselling is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your\u00a0erectile dysfunction. By talking about the issues, you may be able to reduce any anxiety that you have and overcome your\u00a0erectile dysfunction.\nThe counsellor can also provide you with some practical advice about sex, such as how to make effective use of other treatments for\u00a0erectile dysfunction to improve your sex life.\nPsychosexual counselling may take time to work and the results achieved have been mixed.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is another form of counselling that may be useful if you have\u00a0erectile dysfunction. CBT is based on the principle that the way you feel is partly dependent on the way you think about things. CBT helps you realise that your problems are often created by your mindset. It is not the situation itself that is making you unhappy, but how you think about it and react to it.\nYour CBT therapist can help you to identify any unhelpful or unrealistic thoughts that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction \u2013 for example, to do with:\n\nyour self-esteem (the way you feel about yourself)\u00a0\nyour sexuality\u00a0\nyour personal relationships\n\nYour CBT therapist will be able to help you to adopt more realistic and helpful thoughts about these issues.\nPelvic floor muscle exercises\nSome studies have suggested that, in a few cases, it may be beneficial to exercise your pelvic floor muscles. These are a group of muscles around the underside of the bladder and rectum, as well as at the base of the penis.\nPelvic floor muscle exercise involves strengthening and training the muscles used to control the anus (back passage) and urinate. If your GP feels this type of exercise could be beneficial, then you may want to discuss it with a physiotherapist to learn it correctly.\nBy strengthening and training\u00a0these muscles, you may be able to reduce the symptoms of\u00a0erectile dysfunction.\nComplementary therapies\nSome complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, have claimed to treat erectile dysfunction. However, there is little evidence they are useful.\nIn some cases, they may even include ingredients that could interact with other medications and cause side effects.\nAlways speak to your GP before using any complementary therapies.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "A febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever.\nFebrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren't serious.\nAround one in 20 children will have at least one febrile seizure at some point. They most often occur\u00a0between the ages of six months and three years.\nDuring a febrile seizure, the child's body usually becomes stiff, they lose consciousness and their arms and legs twitch. Some children may wet themselves. This is known as a tonic clonic seizure.\nRead more about the symptoms of febrile seizures\nWhat to do during a seizure\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury.\nStay with\u00a0your child\u00a0and try to make a note of how long the seizure lasts.\nIf it's your child's first seizure, or it lasts longer than five minutes,\u00a0take them to the\u00a0nearest hospital\u00a0as soon as possible, or dial 999 for an ambulance. While it's unlikely that there's anything seriously wrong,\u00a0it's best to be sure.\nIf\u00a0your child has had\u00a0febrile seizures\u00a0before and the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or the NHS 24 111 service for advice.\nDon't put anything, including medication,\u00a0in your child\u2019s mouth during a seizure because there's a slight chance that\u00a0they might bite their tongue.\nAlmost all children make a complete recovery after having a febrile seizure.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing febrile seizures\u00a0and treating febrile seizures\nTypes of febrile seizure\nThere are two main types of febrile seizure.\nA simple febrile seizure is the most common type of febrile seizure, accounting for about eight out of 10 cases. It's a fit that:\n\nis a tonic clonic seizure (see above)\nlasts less than 15 minutes\ndoesn't reoccur within 24 hours or the period in which your child has an illness\n\nComplex febrile seizures are less common, accounting for two out of 10 cases. A complex febrile seizure is any seizure that has one or more of the following features:\n\nthe seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes\nyour child only has symptoms in one part of their body (this is known as a partial or focal seizure)\nyour child has another seizure within 24 hours of the first seizure, or during the same period\u00a0of illness\nyour child doesn't fully recover from the seizure within one hour\n\nWhy febrile seizures occur\nThe cause of febrile seizures is unknown, although they're linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above).\nIn most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as:\n\nchickenpox\nflu (influenza)\nmiddle ear infections (otitis media) \ntonsillitis\n\nThere may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures because the chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them. Around one in four children affected by febrile seizures has a family history of the condition.\nRead more about the causes of febrile seizures\nComplications\nFebrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk of epilepsy, as well as other problems.\nRecent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy.\nHowever, this link hasn't been proven and SUDC is incredibly rare, affecting around one in 100,000 children which is equivalent to a 0.001% chance.\nIn addition, one of the biggest studies of its kind looked at more than 1.5 million children with a history of febrile seizures and found no evidence of an increased risk of death in later childhood or adulthood.\nMany parents worry that if their child has one or more febrile seizures, they'll develop epilepsy when they get older. Epilepsy is a condition where a person has repeated seizures without fever.\nWhile it's true that children who have a history of febrile seizures have an increased risk of developing epilepsy, it should be stressed that the risk is still small.\nIt's estimated that children with a history of simple febrile seizures have a one in 50 chance of developing epilepsy in later life. Children with a history of complex febrile seizures have a one in 20 chance of developing epilepsy in later life.\nThis is compared to around a one in 100 chance for people who haven't had febrile seizures.\n\n\nThe main symptom of a febrile seizure is a fit that occurs while a child has a fever.\nFebrile seizures often occur during the first day of a fever, which is defined as a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above.\u00a0\nHowever, there appears to be no connection between the extent of your child\u2019s fever and the start of a seizure. Seizures can occur even if your child has a mild fever.\nSimple febrile seizures\u00a0can\u00a0happen when there's a rapid rise in temperature\u00a0and you may only realise your child is ill when they have a fit.\u00a0Alternatively,\u00a0they can occur as your child\u2019s temperature drops from a high level.\nDuring simple febrile seizures:\n\nyour child\u2019s body will become stiff and their arms and legs will begin to twitch\nthey'll lose consciousness and they may wet or soil themselves\nthey\u00a0may also vomit and foam at the mouth and their eyes may roll back\nthe seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes\nfollowing the seizure, your child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwards\n\nComplex febrile seizures\u00a0tend to last longer than 15 minutes, and the symptoms may only affect one area of your child's body. The seizure sometimes recurs within 24 hours or during the period in which your child is ill.\nSeeking medical advice\nYou should take your child to hospital or dial 999 for an ambulance if:\n\nyour child is having a fit for the first time\nthe seizure lasts longer than five minutes and\u00a0shows no signs of stopping\nyou suspect the seizure is being caused by another serious illness, for example meningitis\nyour child is having breathing difficulties\n\nIf your child has previously had febrile seizures, it's recommended that you telephone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service for advice.\nYou should also contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service if your child shows\u00a0signs and symptoms of\u00a0dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body). This includes:\n\na\u00a0dry mouth\nsunken eyes\na lack of tears when crying\na sunken fontanelle \u2013 the soft spot usually found at the top of a young child\u2019s head\n\n\n\nFebrile seizures are linked to fevers, but the exact cause is unknown.\nSome researchers think that the biological processes associated with a high temperature may be responsible.\nA high temperature is thought to be caused by a bacterial or viral infection that stimulates the release of cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that affect the parts of the brain and nervous system responsible for regulating the body\u2019s temperature. Their release causes a rise in the body's temperature.\nOne theory is that in certain people, high levels of cytokines may temporarily \u2018scramble\u2019 the workings of the brain and nervous system, triggering a seizure.\nFamily history\nAlthough\u00a0febrile seizures are poorly understood, a family history of the conditions is thought to increase the risk.\u00a0\nIf a child has a first-degree relative (mother, father, sister or brother) with a history of febrile seizures, their risk of having seizures increases. The more relatives affected, the higher the risk.\nThis is probably the result of one or more genetic mutations that a child inherits from their parents, which makes them more susceptible to seizures. A genetic mutation means the instructions carried in certain genes\u00a0become \u2018scrambled\u2019, resulting in some of the body\u2019s processes not working in the normal way.\nAssociated infections\nMost febrile seizures occur when\u00a0a child has a high temperature caused by an infection. The three most common infections associated with febrile convulsions are:\n\nviral infections, such as\u00a0chickenpox and flu\nmiddle ear infections (otitis media)\ntonsillitis\n\nOther infections associated with febrile seizures are:\n\nurinary tract infections\u00a0(UTIs)\nupper\u00a0respiratory tract infection\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the mouth, nose and throat, and associated tissues and structures\ngastroenteritis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the digestive system\nlower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia (a lung infection) and bronchitis (an infection of the airways that supply the lungs)\n\nVaccinations\nIn rare cases, febrile seizures can occur after a child has a vaccination. Research has shown that your child has a one in 3,000 to 4,000 chance of having a febrile seizure after having the MMR vaccine.\nThe risks are even lower with the DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine \u2013 a one in 11,000 to 16,000.\n\n\nFebrile seizures can often be diagnosed from a description of what happened.\nFurther tests may be needed if the cause of the associated infection isn't clear.\nIt's unlikely that your doctor\u00a0will see the seizure, so an account of what happened\u00a0is useful.\nIt's useful to know:\n\nhow long the seizure lasted\nwhat happened \u2013 body stiffening, twitching of the face, arms and legs, staring and loss of consciousness\nwhether your child recovered within one hour\nwhether they've had a seizure before\n\nTests to identify the source of the infection will only usually be necessary to rule out rarer conditions which can cause similar symptoms, such as meningitis.\nA blood or urine sample may be needed to test for signs of infection. It can sometimes be difficult to obtain a urine sample from young children, so it may have to be done in hospital.\nRead more about blood tests\nFurther tests\nFurther tests may be carried out in hospital if your child\u2019s symptoms are unusual \u2013 for example, if they don't have a high temperature or their seizures don't follow the normal pattern.\nFurther testing and observation in hospital is also usually recommended if your child is having complex febrile seizures.\nYour child may have other tests including an electroencephalogram and lumbar puncture, particularly if they're less than 12 months old.\nThese two tests\u00a0are explained below.\nAn\u00a0electroencephalogram (EEG) measures your child\u2019s electrical brain activity through electrodes that are placed on their scalp. Unusual patterns of brain activity can sometimes indicate epilepsy.\nHowever, some studies have suggested that an EEG may not be useful in many cases of febrile seizures.\nDuring a lumbar puncture, a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed for testing. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.\nA hollow needle is inserted into the base of the spine to obtain the CSF sample. During the procedure, local anaesthetic will be used to numb your child\u2019s back so that they don't feel any pain.\nA lumbar puncture can be used to determine whether your child has an infection of the brain or nervous system.\n\n\nIn many cases, febrile seizures do not need to be treated, although care should be taken to deal with a seizure as it happens.\nWhat to do during a seizure\nIf your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, and will keep their airway open and help prevent injury.\nStay with your child while they're having a seizure, and make a note of when the seizure started to keep track of how long it lasts. If the seizure lasts for less than five minutes, phone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service.\nIf it's your child's first seizure, or if it lasts longer than five minutes,\u00a0take your child to the nearest hospital\u00a0as soon as possible.\nWhile there's probably nothing seriously wrong with your child, it's best to be sure.\nDon't put anything, including medication,\u00a0in your child\u2019s mouth while they're having a seizure. There's a slight chance that they might bite their tongue, although any damage isn't usually serious and will heal within a few days.\nTrying to stop someone biting their tongue by placing your hand or an object in their mouth could be dangerous both for you and for\u00a0them.\nHigh temperature (fever)\nReducing a high temperature can help make your child feel more comfortable. Paracetamol\u00a0and\u00a0ibuprofen have been shown to be effective in reducing a high temperature. However, they won't reduce the\u00a0chances of your child actually having a seizure.\nRemoving any unnecessary clothes and bedding will also help to lower your child\u2019s temperature.\nAspirin should never be given to children\u00a0under 16 years of age because there's a small risk that the medication could trigger a condition called Reye\u2019s syndrome, which can cause brain and liver damage.\nThe use of cold sponges or fans isn't recommended for treating a high temperature. There's little evidence that they're effective, and they may cause your child discomfort. Your GP will be able to give you additional advice about treating the underlying cause of your child\u2019s high temperature.\nIt's also important to prevent\u00a0dehydration during a fever by making sure your child drinks plenty of fluids.\nRecurring febrile seizures\nAbout one third of children will have a febrile seizure again during a subsequent infection. This often occurs within a year of the first febrile seizure.\nRecurrence is more likely if:\n\nthe first febrile seizure occurred before your child was 18 months old\nthere's a history of seizures or epilepsy\u00a0in your family\nbefore having the first seizure your child had a fever that lasted less than one\u00a0hour or their temperature was less than 40C (104F)\u00a0\nyour child has multiple seizures during the same febrile episode (complex febrile seizure)\nyour child attends a day care nursery (this increases their chances of developing common childhood infections, such as the\u00a0flu or chickenpox)\n\nIt's\u00a0not recommended that your child is given a prescription of regular medicines to prevent further febrile seizures. This is because the adverse side effects associated with many medicines outweigh any risks\u00a0of the seizures themselves.\nResearch has shown that the use of medication to control fever\u00a0isn't likely to prevent recurrence of further febrile seizures.\nHowever, there may be exceptional circumstances where medication to prevent recurrent febrile seizures is recommended. For example, children may need medication if they have a low threshold for having seizures during illness, particularly if the seizures are prolonged.\nIn this case, your child may be prescribed medications such as diazepam or lorazepam to take at the start of a fever.\nChildren who've had a febrile seizure following a routine vaccination (which is very rare), are no more at risk of having another seizure compared to children who've had a seizure due to another cause for fever.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Fibromyalgia, also called fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body.\nAs well as widespread pain, people with fibromyalgia may also have:\n\nincreased\u00a0sensitivity to pain\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nmuscle stiffness\ndifficulty sleeping\nproblems with mental processes (known as \"fibro-fog\") \u2013 such as problems with memory and concentration\nheadaches\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 a digestive condition that causes stomach pain and bloating\n\nIf you think you have fibromyalgia, visit your GP. Treatment is available to ease some of its symptoms, although they're unlikely to disappear completely.\nRead more about the symptoms of fibromyalgia.\nWhat causes fibromyalgia?\nThe exact\u00a0cause of fibromyalgia\u00a0is unknown, but it's thought to be related to abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain and changes in the way\u00a0the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and nerves) processes pain messages carried around the body.\nIt's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents.\nIn\u00a0many cases, the condition\u00a0appears to be triggered by a physically or emotionally stressful event, such as:\n\nan injury or infection\ngiving birth\nhaving an operation\nthe breakdown of a relationship\u00a0\nthe death of a loved one\n\nRead more about the causes of fibromyalgia.\nWho's affected?\nAnyone can develop fibromyalgia, although it affects around seven times as many women as men. The condition typically develops between the ages of 30 and 50, but can occur in people of any age, including children and the elderly.\nIt's not clear exactly how many people are affected by fibromyalgia, although research has suggested it could be a relatively common condition. Some estimates suggest nearly 1 in 20 people\u00a0may be affected by fibromyalgia to some degree.\nOne of the main reasons it's not clear how many people are affected is\u00a0because fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose. There's no specific test for the condition, and the symptoms can be similar to a number of\u00a0other conditions.\nRead more about diagnosing fibromyalgia.\nHow fibromyalgia is treated\nAlthough there's currently no cure for fibromyalgia,\u00a0there are treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms and make the condition easier to live with.\nTreatment tends to be a combination of:\n\nmedication \u2013 such as\u00a0antidepressants and painkillers\ntalking therapies \u2013 such as\u00a0cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling\nlifestyle changes \u2013 such as exercise programmes and relaxation techniques\n\nExercise in particular has been found to have a number of important benefits for people with fibromyalgia, including helping to reduce pain.\nRead more about:\u00a0\n\ntreating fibromyalgia\nself-help for fibromyalgia\n\nSupport groups\nMany people with fibromyalgia find that support groups provide an important network where they can talk to others living with the condition.\nFibromyalgia Action UK\u00a0is a charity that offers information and support to people with fibromyalgia. If you have any questions about fibromyalgia, call the charity's helpline on 0300 999 3333.\nThe charity also has a network of local\u00a0support groups\u00a0you may find helpful and a\u00a0online community, where you can find out about news, events and ongoing research into the condition.\nAnother support group you may find useful is UK Fibromyalgia.\n\n\nFibromyalgia has many symptoms that tend to vary from person to person. The main symptom is widespread pain.\nThere may be periods when your symptoms get better or worse, depending on factors such as:\n\nyour stress levels\nchanges in the weather\nhow physically active you are\n\nIf you think you have fibromyalgia, visit your GP. Treatment is available to ease some of the symptoms, although it's unlikely they'll ever disappear completely.\nThe main symptoms of fibromyalgia are outlined below.\nWidespread pain\nIf you have fibromyalgia, one of the main symptoms is likely to be widespread pain. This may be felt throughout your body, but could be worse in particular areas, such as your back or neck. The pain is likely to be continuous, although it\u00a0may be better or more severe at different times.\nThe pain could feel like:\n\nan ache\na burning sensation\na sharp, stabbing pain\n\nExtreme sensitivity\nFibromyalgia can make you extremely sensitive to pain all over your body, and you may find that even the slightest touch is\u00a0painful. If you hurt yourself\u00a0\u2013 such as stubbing your toe\u00a0\u2013 the pain may continue for much longer than it normally would.\nYou may hear the condition described in the following medical terms:\n\nhyperalgesia \u2013\u00a0when you're extremely sensitive to pain\nallodynia \u2013\u00a0when you feel pain from something that shouldn't be painful at all, such as a very light touch\n\nYou may also\u00a0be sensitive to things such as smoke, certain foods and bright lights. Being exposed to something you're sensitive to can cause your other fibromyalgia symptoms to flare up.\nStiffness\nFibromyalgia can make you feel stiff. The stiffness may be most severe when you've been in the same position for a long period of time\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example,\u00a0when you first wake up in the morning.\nIt can also cause your muscles to spasm, which is when they contract (squeeze) tightly and painfully.\nFatigue\nFibromyalgia can cause fatigue (extreme tiredness). This can range from a mild, tired feeling to the exhaustion often experienced during a flu-like illness.\nSevere fatigue may come on suddenly and can drain you of all your energy. If this happens, you may feel too tired to do anything at all.\nPoor sleep quality\nFibromyalgia can affect your sleep. You may often wake up tired, even when you've had plenty of sleep. This is because\u00a0the condition\u00a0can sometimes prevent you from sleeping deeply enough to refresh you properly.\nYou may hear this described as \"non-restorative sleep\".\nCognitive problems ('fibro-fog')\nCognitive problems are issues related to mental processes, such as thinking and learning. If you have fibromyalgia, you may have:\n\ntrouble remembering and learning new things\nproblems with attention and concentration\nslowed or confused speech\n\nHeadaches\nIf fibromyalgia has caused you to experience pain and stiffness in your neck and shoulders, you may also have frequent headaches.\nThese can vary from being mild headaches to severe migraines,\u00a0and could\u00a0also involve other symptoms, such as nausea (feeling sick).\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nSome people with fibromyalgia also develop\u00a0irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nIBS is a common digestive condition that causes pain and bloating in your stomach. It can also lead to\u00a0constipation or diarrhoea.\nOther symptoms\nOther symptoms that people with fibromyalgia sometimes experience include:\n\ndizziness and clumsiness\nfeeling too hot or too cold\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this is because you're not\u00a0able to regulate your body temperature properly\nrestless legs syndrome\u00a0(an overwhelming urge to move your legs)\ntingling, numbness, prickling or burning sensations in your hands and feet (pins and needles, also known as paraesthesia)\nin women, unusually\u00a0painful periods\nanxiety\u00a0\ndepression\u00a0\n\nIn some cases, having the condition can lead to depression. This is because fibromyalgia\u00a0can be difficult to deal with, and low levels of certain hormones associated with the condition can make you prone to developing depression.\nDepression can cause many symptoms, including:\n\nconstantly feeling low\nfeeling hopeless and helpless\nlosing interest in the things you usually enjoy\n\nIf you think you may be depressed, it's important to get help from your GP or your fibromyalgia healthcare professional, if you've been seeing one.\n\n\nIt's not clear why some people develop fibromyalgia. The exact cause is unknown, but it's likely that a number of factors are involved.\nHere are some of the main factors thought to contribute to the condition:\u00a0\nAbnormal pain messages\nOne of the main theories is that people with fibromyalgia have developed changes in the way the central nervous system processes the\u00a0pain messages carried around the\u00a0body. This could be due to changes to chemicals in the nervous system.\nThe central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and nerves) transmits information all over your body through a network of specialised cells. Changes in the way this system works may explain why fibromyalgia results in constant feelings of, and extreme sensitivity to, pain.\nChemical imbalances\nResearch has found that people\u00a0with fibromyalgia have abnormally low\u00a0levels of the hormones serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine in their brains.\nLow levels of these hormones may be a key factor in the cause of fibromyalgia, as they're important in regulating things such as:\n\nmood\nappetite\nsleep\nbehaviour\nyour\u00a0response\u00a0to stressful situations\n\nThese hormones also play a role in processing pain messages sent\u00a0by the nerves. Increasing the hormone levels with medication can disrupt\u00a0these signals.\nSome researchers have also suggested that changes in the levels of some other hormones, such as cortisol (which is released when the body is under stress), may contribute to fibromyalgia.\nSleep problems\nIt's possible that disturbed sleep patterns may be a cause of fibromyalgia, rather than just a symptom.\nFibromyalgia can prevent you from sleeping deeply and cause fatigue (extreme tiredness). People with\u00a0the condition\u00a0who sleep badly can also have higher levels of pain, suggesting that these sleep problems contribute to the other symptoms of fibromyalgia.\nGenetics\nResearch has suggested that genetics may play a small part in the development of fibromyalgia, with some people perhaps more likely than others to develop the condition because of their genes.\nIf this is the case, genetics could explain why\u00a0many people develop fibromyalgia after some sort of trigger.\nPossible triggers\nFibromyalgia is often triggered by a stressful event, including physical stress or emotional (psychological) stress. Possible triggers for the condition include:\n\nan\u00a0injury\na viral infection\ngiving birth\nhaving an operation\nthe breakdown of a relationship\nbeing in an abusive relationship\nthe death of a loved one\n\nHowever, in some cases, fibromyalgia doesn't develop after any obvious trigger.\nAssociated\u00a0conditions\nThere are several other conditions often associated with fibromyalgia. Generally, these are rheumatic conditions (affecting the joints, muscles and bones), such as:\n\nosteoarthritis \u2013 when damage to the joints causes\u00a0pain and stiffness\nlupus \u2013 when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues in various parts of the body\nrheumatoid arthritis \u2013 when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the joints, causing pain and swelling\nankylosing spondylitis \u2013 pain and swelling in parts of the spine\ntemporomandibular disorder (TMD) \u2013 a condition that can cause pain in the jaw, cheeks, ears and temples\n\nConditions such as these\u00a0are usually tested for when\u00a0diagnosing fibromyalgia.\n\n\nIf you think you have fibromyalgia, visit your GP. Diagnosing fibromyalgia can be difficult, as there's no specific test to diagnose the condition.\nThe\u00a0symptoms of fibromyalgia can vary and are similar to those of several other conditions.\u00a0\nDuring diagnosis, you'll be asked about how your symptoms are affecting your daily life. Your body will also be examined to check for visible signs of other conditions\u00a0\u2013 for example, swollen joints\u00a0may suggest arthritis, rather than fibromyalgia.\nRuling out other conditions\nIf your GP thinks you may have fibromyalgia, they'll first have to rule out all other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. These conditions may include:\n\nchronic fatigue syndrome (also known as ME) \u2013 a condition that causes long-term tiredness\nrheumatoid arthritis \u2013 a condition that causes pain and\u00a0swelling in the joints\nmultiple sclerosis (MS) \u2013 a condition of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) that affects movement and balance\n\nTests to check for some of these conditions\u00a0include urine and\u00a0blood tests, although you may also have\u00a0X-rays and other scans. If you're found to have another condition, you could still have fibromyalgia as well.\nCriteria for diagnosing fibromyalgia\nFor fibromyalgia to be diagnosed, certain criteria usually have to be met. The\u00a0most widely used criteria for diagnosis are:\n\nyou either have severe pain in three to six different areas of your body, or you have milder pain in seven or more different areas\nyour symptoms have stayed at a similar level for at least three months\nno other reason for your symptoms has been found\n\nThe extent of\u00a0the pain used to be assessed by applying gentle pressure to certain \"tender points\", where any pain\u00a0is likely to be at its worst. However, this is\u00a0less common nowadays.\nDiagnosing other conditions\nIt's also possible to have other conditions alongside your fibromyalgia, such as:\n\ndepression\nanxiety\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n\nIf your symptoms suggest that you have another condition as well as fibromyalgia, you may need further tests to diagnose these. Identifying all possible conditions will help to guide your treatment.\n\n\nTreatment for fibromyalgia tries to ease some of your symptoms and improve quality of life, but there's currently no cure.\nYour GP will play an important role in your treatment and care.\u00a0They can\u00a0help you decide what's best for you,\u00a0depending on what you prefer and the available\u00a0treatments.\nIn some cases, several different healthcare professionals may also be involved in your care, such as:\n\na rheumatologist \u2013 a specialist in conditions that affect muscles and joints\na neurologist \u2013 a specialist in conditions of the central nervous system\na psychologist \u2013 a specialist in mental health\u00a0and psychological treatments\n\nFibromyalgia has numerous symptoms, meaning that no single treatment will work for all of them. Treatments that work for some people won't necessarily work for others.\nYou may need to try a variety of treatments to find a combination that suits you. This will normally be a combination of medication and lifestyle changes.\nInformation and support\nYou may find it helpful to research fibromyalgia to improve your understanding of the condition. Many people also find support groups helpful. Just talking to someone who knows what you're going though can make you feel better.\nYou can visit\u00a0UK Fibromyalgia's support group section for a list of fibromyalgia support groups across the country.\nFibromyalgia Action UK is a charity that offers information and support to anyone who has fibromyalgia. It has\u00a0a telephone service (0300 999 3333) you can call with any questions about the condition. It also has a network of local\u00a0support groups\u00a0you may find helpful.\nThere's also an\u00a0online community where you can find out about news, events and ongoing research.\nMedication\nYou may need to take several different types of medicines for fibromyalgia, including painkillers and antidepressants. These are described below.\nSimple painkillers that are\u00a0available over the counter from a pharmacy, such as paracetamol, can sometimes help relieve\u00a0the pain associated with fibromyalgia. However, these aren't suitable for everyone, so make sure you\u00a0read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions that come with the medication before using them.\nIf over-the-counter painkillers aren't effective, your GP (or another healthcare professional treating you) may prescribe a stronger painkiller, such as\u00a0codeine or tramadol.\nHowever, these\u00a0painkillers can\u00a0be addictive and their effect tends to weaken over time. This means that your dose may need to be gradually increased and you could experience\u00a0withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them. Other side effects include diarrhoea\u00a0and fatigue (extreme tiredness).\nAntidepressant medication\u00a0can also help to relieve pain for some people with\u00a0fibromyalgia. They boost the levels of certain chemicals that carry messages to and from the brain, known as neurotransmitters.\nLow levels of\u00a0neurotransmitters may be a factor in fibromyalgia, and it's believed that increasing their levels may ease the widespread pain associated with the condition.\nThere are\u00a0different types of antidepressants. The choice of medicine largely depends on\u00a0the severity of your symptoms and any side effects the medicine may cause.\nAntidepressants used to treat fibromyalgia include:\n\ntricyclic antidepressants \u2013 such as amitriptyline\nserotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) \u2013 such as duloxetine and\u00a0venlafaxine\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2013 such as fluoxetine and paroxetine\n\nA medication called\u00a0pramipexole, which isn't an antidepressant, but also\u00a0affects the levels of neurotransmitters,\u00a0is sometimes used as well.\nAntidepressants can cause a number of side effects, including:\n\nfeeling sick\ndry mouth\ndrowsiness\nfeeling agitated, shaky or anxious\ndizziness\nweight gain\nconstipation\n\nFor information on the side effects of your particular medication, check the patient information leaflet that comes with it.\nAs fibromyalgia can affect your sleeping patterns, you may want medicine to help you sleep. If you're sleeping better, you may find that other symptoms aren't as severe.\nSpeak to your GP if you think you could benefit from\u00a0a medicine like this. They may recommend an over-the-counter remedy, or prescribe a short course of a stronger medication. Some antidepressants may also improve your sleep quality.\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0treating insomnia for information on good sleeping techniques and medicines to help you sleep.\nIf you have muscle stiffness or spasms (when the muscles contract painfully) as a result of fibromyalgia, your GP may prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant, such as diazepam.\nThese medicines may also help you sleep better because they can have a sedative (sleep-inducing) effect.\nYou may also be prescribed an anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) medicine, as these can be effective for those with fibromyalgia.\nThe most commonly used\u00a0anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia\u00a0are pregabalin\u00a0and gabapentin. These are normally used to treat epilepsy, but research has shown they can improve the pain associated with fibromyalgia in some people.\nSome common side effects of pregablin and gabapentin include:\n\ndizziness\ndrowsiness\nswelling of your hands and feet (oedema)\nweight gain\n\nAntipsychotic medicines, also called neuroleptics, are sometimes used to help relieve long-term pain. Studies have shown that these medications may help conditions such as fibromyalgia, but further research is needed to confirm this.\nPossible side effects include:\n\ndrowsiness\ntremors (shaking)\nrestlessness\n\nOther treatment options\nAs well as medication, there are other treatment options\u00a0that can be used to help cope with the pain of fibromyalgia, such as:\n\nswimming, sitting or exercising in a heated pool or warm water (known as hydrotherapy or balneotherapy)\nan individually tailored exercise programme\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013\u00a0a talking therapy that aims to change the way you think about things, so you can tackle problems more positively\npsychotherapy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a talking therapy that helps you understand\u00a0and deal with your thoughts and feelings\nrelaxation techniques\npsychological support\u00a0\u2013\u00a0any kind of\u00a0counselling\u00a0or support group that helps you deal with issues caused by fibromyalgia\u00a0\n\nSee self-help for fibromyalgia\u00a0for more information about exercise and relaxation techniques.\nAlternative therapies\nSome people with fibromyalgia try complementary or alternative treatments, such as:\u00a0\n\nacupuncture\nmassage\nmanipulation\naromatherapy\n\nThere's little scientific evidence that such treatments help in the long term. However, some people find that certain treatments help them to relax and feel less stressed, allowing them to cope with their condition better.\nResearch into some complementary medicines, such as plant extracts, has found they're not effective in treating fibromyalgia. If you decide to use any complementary or herbal remedies, check with your GP first. Some remedies can react unpredictably with other medication, or make it less effective.\nTreating other conditions\nIf you've been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and another condition, such as\u00a0depression or\u00a0irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you may need to have separate treatment for these. For example, additional counselling or medication may be recommended.\u00a0\nRead more about:\u00a0\n\ntreating depression\ntreating IBS\n\n\n\nIf you have fibromyalgia, there are several ways to change your lifestyle to help relieve your symptoms and make your condition easier to live with.\nYour GP, or another healthcare professional treating you, can offer advice and support about making these changes part of your everyday life.\nThere are organisations to support people with fibromyalgia that may also be able to offer advice. Visit\u00a0UK Fibromyalgia's support group section for a list of support groups across the country. You may also find it helpful to talk to other people with fibromyalgia on this online community.\nBelow are some tips that may help relieve symptoms of fibromyalgia.\nExercise\nAs fatigue (extreme tiredness) and pain are two of the main symptoms of fibromyalgia, you may find that you're not able to exercise as much as you'd like. However, an exercise programme specially suited to your condition can help you manage your symptoms and improve your overall health.\nYour GP or physiotherapist (healthcare professional trained in using physical techniques to promote healing) can design you a personal exercise programme, which is likely to involve a mixture of aerobic and strengthening exercises.\nAerobic activities are any kind of rhythmic, moderate-intensity exercises that increase your heart rate and make you breathe harder. Examples include:\n\nwalking\ncycling\nswimming\n\nResearch suggests that aerobic fitness exercises should be included in your personalised exercise plan, even if you can't complete these at a high level of intensity. For example, if you find jogging too difficult, you could try brisk walking instead.\nA review of a number of studies found that aerobic exercises may improve quality of life and relieve pain. As aerobic exercises increase your endurance (how long you can keep going), these may also help you function better on a day-to-day basis.\u00a0\nResistance and strengthening exercises are those that focus on strength training, such as lifting weights. These exercises need to be planned as part of a personalised exercise programme; if they aren't, muscle stiffness and soreness could be made worse.\nA review of a number of studies concluded that strengthening exercises may improve:\n\nmuscle strength\nphysical disability\ndepression\nquality of life\n\nPeople with fibromyalgia who completed the strengthening exercises in these studies said they felt less tired, could function better and experienced a boost in mood.\nImproving the strength of your major muscle groups can make it easier to do aerobic exercises.\nRead more information and advice on\u00a0health and fitness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPacing yourself\nIf you have fibromyalgia, it's important to pace yourself. This means balancing periods of activity with periods of rest, and not overdoing it or pushing yourself beyond your limits.\nIf you don't pace yourself, it could slow down your progress in the long term. Over time, you can gradually increase your periods of activity, while making sure they're balanced with periods of rest.\nIf you have fibromyalgia, you will probably have some days when your symptoms are better than others. Try to maintain a steady level of activity without overdoing it, but listen to your body and rest whenever you need to.\nAvoid any exercise or activity that pushes you too hard, because this can make your symptoms worse. If you pace your activities at a level that's right for you, rather than trying to do as much as possible in a short space of time, you should make steady progress.\nFor example, it may help to start with gentler forms of exercise\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as tai chi,\u00a0yoga and\u00a0pilates\u00a0\u2013 before attempting more strenuous aerobic or strengthening exercises.\nRelaxation\nIf you have fibromyalgia, it's important to regularly take time to relax or practice relaxation techniques.\u00a0Stress can make your symptoms worse or cause them to flare up more often. It could also increase your chances of developing depression.\nThere are many relaxation aids available, including books, tapes and courses, although deep-breathing techniques or meditation may be just as effective. Try to find time each day to do something that relaxes you. Taking time to relax before bed may also help you sleep better at night.\nTalking therapies, such as counselling, can also be helpful in combating stress and learning to deal with it effectively. Your GP may recommend you try this as part of your treatment.\nBetter sleeping habits\nFibromyalgia can make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep (known as\u00a0insomnia). If you have problems sleeping, it may help to:\n\nget up at the same time every morning\ntry to relax before going to bed\ntry to create a bedtime routine,\u00a0such as taking a bath and drinking a warm, milky drink every night\navoid caffeine, nicotine and alcohol before going to bed\navoid eating a heavy meal late at night\nmake sure your bedroom is a comfortable temperature, and is quiet and dark\navoid checking the time throughout the night\n\nRead more insomnia self-help tips.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Flatulence is passing gas from the digestive system out of the back passage. It's more commonly known as \"passing wind\", or \"farting\".\nFarting is often laughed about, but excessive flatulence can be embarrassing and make you feel uncomfortable around others. However, it can usually be controlled with\u00a0changes to your diet and lifestyle.\nFlatulence is\u00a0a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about\u00a05 to 15 times a day.\nWhy\u00a0it happens\nWhen you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by\u00a0farting (flatulence) or\u00a0burping (belching).\nSometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur. However, it's important to remember it's normal for the gas you pass to sometimes smell a bit.\nExcessive\u00a0flatulence can be caused by swallowing more air than usual or\u00a0eating food that's difficult to digest. It can also be\u00a0related to\u00a0an underlying health problem affecting the digestive system, such as recurring indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nRead more about the causes of flatulence.\nWhen to see your GP\nThere are no medical guidelines defining the normal frequency or volume of flatulence. You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms.\nSee your GP if your flatulence is particularly troublesome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if you're frequently passing smelly gas.\nYou should also visit your GP if you experience additional symptoms, such as:\n\npersistent\u00a0abdominal pain and bloating\nrecurring episodes of\u00a0diarrhoea or\u00a0constipation\nunexplained weight loss\nbowel incontinence\u00a0\nblood in your stools\u00a0(faeces)\nsigns of an infection,\u00a0such as a high temperature, vomiting, chills,\u00a0joint pain and muscle pain\n\nThese symptoms could be an indicator of a more serious health problem and may\u00a0require investigation, such as a blood or stool test to look for an infection.\nControlling the problem\nExcessive\u00a0flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as:\n\navoiding foods known to cause flatulence\neating smaller and more frequent meals\neating and drinking slowly\nexercising regularly\n\nThere are also some over-the-counter medications that can help if your flatulence is troublesome, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone.\nIf your flatulence is related to an underlying health problem, treating the condition may help\u00a0resolve it.\nRead more about treating flatulence.\n\n\nThere are several natural causes of flatulence. Flatulence can also be caused by some health conditions related to the digestive system, or as a side effect of certain medicines.\nSwallowing air\nIt's perfectly normal to swallow air while breathing and eating. However, it's easy to swallow a lot more air than usual without realising it. This can cause excessive flatulence.\nExcess air can be swallowed by:\n\nchewing gum\nsmoking\nsucking on pen tops or hard sweets\nhaving loose-fitting dentures\nnot chewing food slowly and thoroughly\u00a0\u2013 swallowing large pieces of food causes you to swallow more air\n\nHot and fizzy drinks also increase the amount of carbon dioxide in your stomach, although this is more likely to cause belching rather than flatulence.\nFood and drink\nSome carbohydrates in food\u00a0can't be digested and absorbed by the intestines.\u00a0These pass down into your colon to be broken down by bacteria, producing gas, which is released as flatulence.\nFoods containing a high amount of unabsorbable carbohydrates include:\n\nbeans\nbroccoli\ncabbage\ncauliflower\nartichokes\nraisins\npulses\nlentils\nonions\nprunes\napples\nBrussels sprouts\n\nFoods containing a lot of unrefined cereal fibre, such as bran, can also sometimes cause problems with wind and bloating.\nOther foods and drinks that contain a sweetener called sorbitol\u00a0(such as sugar-free gum or slimming products) or a\u00a0type of sugar called fructose (such as fruit juice)\u00a0can also cause flatulence. This means chewing sugar-free gum can cause flatulence from both the sweetener and\u00a0swallowing\u00a0air.\nCertain foods, such as cabbage or onions, can lead to the production of gases containing sulphur, which can result in foul-smelling wind. However, the production of smelly wind can vary from person to person depending on what you eat, so it's up to you to work out which foods cause the most smell.\nHealth conditions\nCertain health conditions can cause symptoms of flatulence, including:\n\nindigestion\nconstipation\u00a0\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a common digestive condition, which\u00a0can cause stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation\ncoeliac disease\u00a0\u2013 an intolerance to a protein called gluten, found in wheat, rye and barley\nlactose intolerance\u00a0\u2013 where the body is unable to break down lactose (a natural sugar found in milk and dairy products) and can't absorb it into the blood\ngastroenteritis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a stomach and bowel infection\nmalabsorption\u00a0\u2013 where the intestines are unable to absorb nutrients properly\ngiardiasis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the digestive system\u00a0caused by tiny parasites\n\nMedicine\nFlatulence, often caused by indigestion,\u00a0is a possible side effect of many types of medicine, including:\n\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen\nsome laxatives\nantifungal medicines\nstatins\n\n\n\nExcessive flatulence can usually be treated by making changes to your diet and lifestyle.\nSeveral over-the-counter treatments are also available if your flatulence is becoming a problem.\nSelf care advice\nYou should try to avoid eating foods high in unabsorbable carbohydrates. For a list of these foods, see causes of flatulence. Certain processed foods should also be avoided as they can contain ingredients that cause flatulence, including:\n\nany foods with artifical sweeteners\nsugar-free sweets or chewing gum\nfizzy drinks\n\nHowever, it's still important to eat a healthy balanced diet, including at least 5\u00a0portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Choose foods containing carbohydrates that are easy to digest. These include:\n\npotatoes\nrice\nlettuce\nbananas\ngrapes\ncitrus fruits, such as oranges\nyoghurt\n\nIt's important to note that\u00a0people react differently to certain foods, so some foods listed above may still cause flatulence. You may\u00a0find it useful\u00a0to keep a food diary to see whether certain foods make your symptoms better or worse.\nYou may also find it useful to eat 6\u00a0small meals a day rather than 3\u00a0large ones. Smaller meals are easier to digest and may produce less gas.\nThere's some evidence to suggest drinking peppermint tea can help improve the symptoms of flatulence. There's also some evidence that small amounts of ginger can help with digestion or an upset stomach, which may be causing flatulence. However, pregnant women should consult their doctor before taking ginger.\nWhen eating, make sure you chew\u00a0food slowly to reduce the amount of air you swallow. This will also help with digestion. Avoid chewing gum as it can also cause you to swallow more air than usual.\nYou should also give up smoking, if you smoke. Smoking can cause you to swallow more air than usual, and tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system.\u00a0See\u00a0stop\u00a0smoking\u00a0for more information and advice about quitting smoking.\nGetting plenty of exercise can help improve the functioning of your digestive system and bowel. It has also been shown to help with bloating and the passage of gas.\nMedications and other remedies\nThere are\u00a0several over-the-counter remedies that can help treat the symptoms of flatulence, some of which are described below.\nCharcoal tablets\u00a0are a type of medication available over the counter from pharmacists. The charcoal absorbs gas in the digestive system, which helps\u00a0reduce symptoms.\nCharcoal tablets may not be suitable for you if you are currently taking other medication. This is because the charcoal might absorb the medication and make it less effective. If you are taking other medication, ask your GP or pharmacist for advice before taking charcoal tablets.\nClothing containing activated charcoal, or charcoal pads placed inside clothing,\u00a0can help absorb foul-smelling gas released during flatulence. These\u00a0products can be\u00a0purchased online.\nSimethicone is another over-the-counter medication that can also sometimes help with gas problems.\nAlpha-galactosidase is a dietary supplement that may help improve the digestion of carbohydrates and reduce\u00a0symptoms of flatulence. It's found in a product called Beano, which has been shown to have some effect in reducing flatulence and is available from some pharmacists and health food shops.\nProbiotics may also be useful in treating flatulence. Probiotics are a dietary supplement, usually sold in liquid or capsule form, which encourages the growth of \"friendly bacteria\" in your digestive system.\nThe \"friendly bacteria\" should help digestion and reduce the symptoms of flatulence, particularly in\u00a0people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotic yoghurts may also help, but avoid those with artificial sweeteners or added fibre.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Flu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes.

They hang suspended in the air for a while before landing on surfaces, where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours.\nAnyone who breathes in the droplets can catch flu. You can also catch the virus by touching the surfaces that the\u00a0droplets have landed on\u00a0if\u00a0you\u00a0pick up the virus on your hands and then touch your\u00a0nose or mouth.\nEveryday items at home and in public places can easily become contaminated with\u00a0the flu virus, including food, door handles, remote controls, handrails, telephone handsets\u00a0and computer keyboards. Therefore, it's important to wash your hands frequently.\nYou can catch flu many times\u00a0because flu viruses change regularly and your body won't have a natural resistance to the new versions.\nPreventing the spread of flu\nYou can help stop yourself catching flu\u00a0or spreading it to others with good hygiene measures.\nAlways wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water, as well as:\n\nregularly cleaning surfaces\u00a0such as\u00a0your computer keyboard, telephone and door handles\u00a0to get rid of germs\nusing tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze\nputting used tissues in a bin as soon as possible\n\nYou can also help stop the spread of flu by avoiding unnecessary contact with other people while you're infectious. You should stay off work or school until you're feeling better.\nIn some people at risk of more serious flu, an annual flu vaccine or antiviral medication may be recommended to help reduce the risk of becoming infected.\nRead more about\u00a0how to stop the spread of flu\nWhat's the difference between a cold and a flu?\n\n\n\nThe symptoms of flu usually develop within 1\u00a0to 3\u00a0days of becoming infected. Most people will feel better within a week.\nHowever, you may have a lingering\u00a0cough and\u00a0still feel very tired for a further\u00a0couple of weeks.\nMain symptoms\nFlu can give you any of the following\u00a0symptoms:\n\na sudden fever\u00a0\u2013 a temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\na dry, chesty\u00a0cough\na headache\ntiredness and weakness\nchills\naching muscles\nlimb or\u00a0joint pain\ndiarrhoea\u00a0or\u00a0abdominal (tummy) pain\nnausea and vomiting\na sore throat\na runny or blocked nose\nsneezing\nloss of appetite\ndifficulty sleeping\n\nIs it flu or a cold?\nIt can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have flu or just a cold, as the symptoms can be quite similar.

See your GP if your symptoms get worse or last longer than a week.\nRead the page on\u00a0preventing flu\u00a0for more information about stopping the infection spreading to others.\nAntiviral medication\nIn 2009, the\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u00a0recommended that doctors should consider treating people in the at-risk groups mentioned above with the antiviral medications oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) to reduce the risk of\u00a0complications of flu.\nAntivirals work by stopping the flu virus from multiplying in the body. They won't cure flu, but they may help slightly reduce the length of\u00a0the illness\u00a0and relieve some of the symptoms.\nRecent research has suggested that Tamiflu and Relenza may not be effective at reducing the risk of flu complications and could cause side effects, so not all doctors agree they should be used.\nBut there is\u00a0evidence\u00a0that antivirals can reduce the risk of death in patients hospitalised with flu. In the light of this evidence, Public Health England says it is important that doctors treating severely unwell patients continue to prescribe these drugs where appropriate.\nFor more information read the NICE guidelines on\u00a0antivirals to treat influenza.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics\u00a0aren't prescribed for flu as they have no effect on viruses, although they may be prescribed if you develop a complication of flu, such as a bacterial\u00a0chest infection.\n\n\nComplications of flu mostly affect people in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, pregnant women and those who have a long-term medical condition or weakened immune system.\nThis is why it's important for people in these groups to have the\u00a0annual flu\u00a0vaccination and consider seeing their GP if they develop symptoms of flu.\nChest infections\nThe most common complication of flu is a bacterial chest infection, such as bronchitis. Occasionally, this can become serious and develop into pneumonia.\nA course of\u00a0antibiotics usually cures\u00a0a chest infection or pneumonia, but it\u00a0can very occasionally\u00a0become life-threatening, particularly in the frail and elderly.\nWorsening of existing conditions\nIn some people with long-term health conditions, getting flu can make their condition worse.\nFor example, people with lung conditions such as\u00a0asthma or\u00a0chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may find that their symptoms become more severe when they get the flu.\nIn people with diabetes, flu can affect\u00a0blood sugar levels, potentially causing hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) or, in people with type 1 diabetes,\u00a0diabetic ketoacidosis (a dangerous condition caused by a lack of insulin in the body).\nIf you have type 1 diabetes or have\u00a0type 2 diabetes and take insulin, it's a good idea to monitor your blood sugar level more closely while you\u2019re feeling unwell.\u00a0\nPregnancy complications\nIf you get flu while you're pregnant, there's a risk that the infection could cause problems with your pregnancy.\nFlu may cause you to go into premature labour\u00a0(before 37 weeks of pregnancy), or it may result in your baby having a low birth weight.\nOccasionally, getting flu during pregnancy can result in\u00a0a\u00a0miscarriage or stillbirth.\nRare complications\nLess common complications of flu include:\n\ntonsillitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inflammation of the tonsils\notitis media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an infection of the middle ear\nsinusitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inflammation of the lining of the sinuses (small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead)\nfebrile seizures (convulsions)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a fit that can happen when a child has a fever\nmeningitis \u2013 infection in the brain and spinal cord\nencephalitis\u00a0\u2013 inflammation of the brain\n\n\n\nThere are 3\u00a0main ways of preventing flu:\n\nthe flu vaccination\ngood hygiene (such as handwashing and cleaning)\nantiviral medication\n\nThe\u00a0flu vaccine\nThe annual flu vaccine can help reduce your risk of getting flu each year, although it's not 100% effective because it doesn't work against every possible type of\u00a0flu virus.\nWith coronavirus (COVID-19) around, it is more important than ever to get the flu vaccine this autumn to protect yourself, others and the NHS.\nFind out more about the flu vaccine\nGood hygiene\nTo\u00a0reduce\u00a0your risk of getting flu or spreading it to other people, you should always:\n\nmake sure\u00a0you wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water\nclean surfaces (such as your keyboard, telephone and door handles) regularly to get rid of germs\nuse tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze\nput used tissues in a bin as soon as possible\n\nAntiviral medication\nTaking\u00a0the antiviral medicines\u00a0oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) to prevent flu is recommended if all of the following apply:\n\nthere's a lot of flu around\nyou're over 65, pregnant, or have a medical condition that puts you at risk of complications of flu,\u00a0such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease,\u00a0kidney disease or a neurological disease\u00a0\nyou've\u00a0been in contact with someone with a flu-like illness and can start antiviral treatment within 36-48 hours\nyou\u00a0haven't had the flu vaccination\n\nIf there's an outbreak of flu in a residential or nursing home \u2013 where the flu virus can often spread very quickly \u2013 antiviral medication\u00a0may be offered to people if they've been in contact with someone with confirmed flu.\nFor more information, read the guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on antivirals to prevent influenza.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food.

Try to drink plenty of water, even if you can only sip it.\nEat when you feel up to it, but try small, light meals at first and stick to bland foods \u2013 such as toast, crackers, bananas and rice \u2013 until you begin to feel better.\nOral rehydration solutions (ORS), which are available from pharmacies, are recommended for more vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with another health condition.\nRead more about treating food poisoning\nWhen to see your GP\nYou should\u00a0contact your GP if:\n\nyour symptoms are severe \u2013 for example, if\u00a0you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly\nyour symptoms don't start to improve after a few days\nyou have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine\nyou're pregnant\nyou're over 60\nyour\u00a0baby or\u00a0young child has suspected food poisoning\nyou have a\u00a0long-term underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), heart valve disease, diabetes or kidney disease\nyou have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, because of medication, cancer treatment or HIV\n\nIn these situations, your GP may send off a stool sample for analysis and prescribe antibiotics, or they may refer you to hospital so you can be looked after more closely.\nHow is food contaminated?\nFood can become contaminated at any stage during production, processing or cooking. For example, it can be contaminated\u00a0by:\n\nnot cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat)\nnot correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C\nleaving cooked food for too long at warm temperatures\nnot sufficiently reheating previously cooked food\nsomeone who is ill or who has dirty hands touching the food\neating food that has passed its \"use by\" date\nthe spread of bacteria between contaminated foods (cross-contamination)\n\nFoods particularly susceptible to contamination if not handled, stored or cooked properly include:\n\nraw meat and poultry\nraw eggs\nraw shellfish\nunpasteurised milk\n\"ready-to-eat\" foods, such as cooked sliced meats, p\u00e2t\u00e9, soft cheeses and pre-packed sandwiches\n\nRead more about the causes of food poisoning and preventing food poisoning\n\n\nFood can become contaminated at any stage during its production, processing or cooking.\nFor example,\u00a0it can become contaminated by:\n\nnot cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat)\nnot\u00a0correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C\nkeeping cooked food unrefrigerated for a long period\neating food that has been touched by someone who is ill or has been in contact with someone with\u00a0diarrhoea and\u00a0vomiting\ncross-contamination (where harmful bacteria are spread between food, surfaces and equipment)\n\nCross-contamination can occur, for example, if you prepare raw chicken on a chopping board and don't wash the board before preparing food that won't be cooked (such as salad), as the harmful bacteria can be spread from the chopping board to the salad.\nIt\u00a0can also occur if raw meat is stored above ready-to-eat meals and juices from the meat drip on to the food below.\nSee\u00a0preventing food poisoning for information about reducing these risks\nTypes of infection\nFood contamination is usually caused by bacteria, but it can also sometimes be caused by viruses or parasites. Some of the main sources of contamination are described below.\nIn the UK, campylobacter bacteria are the most common cause of food poisoning. The bacteria are usually found on raw or undercooked meat (particularly poultry), unpasteurised milk and untreated water.\nThe incubation period (the time between eating contaminated food and the start of symptoms) for food poisoning caused by campylobacter is usually between two and five days. The symptoms usually last less than a week.\nSalmonella bacteria are often found in raw or undercooked meat, raw eggs, milk, and other dairy products.\nThe incubation period is usually between 12 and 72 hours. The symptoms usually last around four to seven days.\nListeria bacteria may be found in a range of chilled, \"ready-to-eat\" foods, including pre-packed sandwiches, cooked sliced meats and p\u00e2t\u00e9, and soft cheeses (such as Brie or Camembert).\nAll of these foods should be eaten by their \"use-by\" dates. This is particularly important for pregnant women, because a listeria infection (known as listeriosis) in pregnancy can cause pregnancy and birth complications, and can result in miscarriage.\nThe incubation period can vary considerably, from a few days to several weeks. The symptoms will usually pass within three days.\nEscherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness.\nMost cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk.\nThe incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is typically one to eight days. The symptoms usually last for a few days or weeks.\nShigella bacteria can\u00a0contaminate any food that has been washed in contaminated water.\nSymptoms typically develop within seven days of eating contaminated food and last for up to a week.\nAn infection caused by Shigella bacteria is known as bacillary dysentery or shigellosis. See the topic on dysentery for more information about it.\nThe virus that most commonly causes diarrhoea and vomiting is the norovirus. It's easily spread from person to person, through contaminated food or water. Raw shellfish, particularly oysters, can also be a source of infection.\nThe incubation period typically lasts 24-48 hours and the symptoms usually pass in a couple of days.\nIn young children, the rotavirus is a common cause of infection from contaminated food. The symptoms usually develop within a week and pass in around five to seven days.\nIn the UK, food poisoning\u00a0caused by parasites is rare. It's much more common in the developing world.\nParasitic infections that can be spread in contaminated food include:\n\ngiardiasis \u2013 an infection caused by a parasite called Giardia intestinalis\ncryptosporidiosis \u2013 an infection caused by a parasite called Cryptosporidium\nameobiasis \u2013 a type of dysentery caused by a single-cell parasite (ameoba) called Entamoeba histolytica (this is very rare in the UK)\n\nThe symptoms of food poisoning caused by a parasite usually develop within 10 days of eating contaminated food, although sometimes it may be weeks before you feel unwell.\nIf left untreated, the symptoms can last a long time \u2013 sometimes several weeks or even a few months.\n\n\nFood poisoning can usually be treated at home without seeking medical advice. Most people will feel better within a few days.\nIt's important to avoid\u00a0dehydration\u00a0by drinking plenty of water, even if you can only sip it,\u00a0as you need to replace any\u00a0fluids\u00a0lost through vomiting and diarrhoea.\nYou should also:\n\nrest as much as possible\neat when you feel up to it\u00a0\u2013 sticking to small, light and non-fatty meals at first (bland foods such as\u00a0toast, crackers, rice and bananas are good choices)\navoid alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks\u00a0and spicy and fatty foods because they may make you feel worse\n\nContact\u00a0your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to improve in a few days.\nPreventing the spread of infection\nIf you have food poisoning, you shouldn't prepare food for other people and you should try to keep contact with vulnerable people, such as the elderly or very young, to a minimum.\nStay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea.\nIf someone you live with has food poisoning, you\u00a0should:\n\nmake sure everyone in your household (including yourself) washes their hands with soap and warm water regularly \u2013 particularly after going to the toilet and before and after preparing food\nclean surfaces,\u00a0toilet seats, flush handles, basins and taps frequently\nmake sure everyone has their own towels and flannels\nwash the laundry of\u00a0the infected person on the hottest washing machine setting\n\nOral rehydration\u00a0solution (ORS)\nOral rehydration solutions (ORS) are recommended for people vulnerable to the effects of dehydration, such as the elderly and those with a pre-existing health condition.\nORSs are available in sachets from pharmacies. You dissolve them in water to drink and they help replace salt, glucose and other important minerals your body loses through dehydration.\nIf you have a kidney condition, some types of oral rehydration salts may not be suitable for you. Ask your pharmacist or GP for further advice about this.\nFurther treatment\nIf your symptoms are severe or persistent, or you are more vulnerable to serious infection (for example, because you are elderly or have an underlying health condition), you may need further treatment.\nTests may be carried out on a stool sample to find out what it causing your symptoms and antibiotics may be prescribed if the results show you have a bacterial infection.\nMedication to stop you vomiting (anti-emetics) may also be prescribed if your vomiting is particularly severe.\nIn some cases, you may need to be admitted to hospital for a few days so you can be monitored and given fluids directly into a vein (intravenously).\n\n\nThe best way to avoid getting food poisoning is to ensure you maintain high standards of personal and food hygiene when storing, handling and preparing food.\nThe\u00a0Food Standards Scotland\u00a0(FSS)\u00a0recommends remembering the \"four Cs\":\n\ncleaning\ncooking\nchilling\ncross-contamination (avoiding it)\n\nIt's also recommended that you stick to a food\u2019s \"use by\" date and the storage instructions on the packet.\nThese steps are important because\u00a0things such\u00a0as a food's appearance\u00a0and smell\u00a0aren't a reliable way of telling if\u00a0it's safe to eat.\nCleaning\nYou can prevent the spread of harmful bacteria and viruses by maintaining good personal hygiene standards and keeping work surfaces and utensils clean.\nRegularly wash your hands\u00a0with soap and warm water, particularly:\n\nafter going to the toilet or changing a baby's nappy\nbefore preparing food\nafter handling raw food\nafter touching bins or pets\n\nYou shouldn't\u00a0handle food if you are ill with stomach problems, such as diarrhoea or\u00a0vomiting or you have any uncovered sores or cuts.\nCooking\nIt's important to cook food thoroughly, particularly meat and most types of seafood, to kill any harmful bacteria that may be present.\nMake sure the food is cooked thoroughly and is steaming hot in the middle. To check that meat is cooked, insert a knife into the thickest or deepest part. It is fully cooked if the juices are clear and there is no pink or red meat.\u00a0Some meat, such as steaks and joints of beef or lamb, can be served rare (not cooked in the middle), as long as the outside has been cooked properly.\nWhen reheating food, make sure it is steaming hot all the way through. Don't\u00a0reheat food more than once.\nChilling\nCertain foods need to be kept at the correct temperature to prevent harmful bacteria from growing and multiplying. Always check the storage instructions on the label.\nIf food\u00a0has to be refrigerated,\u00a0make sure\u00a0your fridge is set to\u00a00\u20135C (32\u201341F).\nIf food that needs to be chilled is left at room temperature, bacteria can grow and multiply to dangerous levels.\nCooked leftovers should be cooled quickly, ideally within\u00a0a couple of\u00a0hours, and put in your fridge or freezer.\nCross-contamination\nCross-contamination\u00a0is when bacteria are transferred from foods (usually raw foods) to other foods.\nThis can occur when one food touches or drips onto another food, or when bacteria on your hands, work surfaces, equipment or utensils are spread to food.\nTo prevent cross-contamination:\n\nalways wash your hands after handling raw food\nstore\u00a0raw and ready-to-eat foods separately\nstore raw meat in sealable containers at the bottom of your fridge so that it cannot drip onto other foods\nuse a different chopping board for raw food and ready-to-eat food, or wash it\u00a0thoroughly in between preparing different types of food\nclean knives and other utensils thoroughly after using them\u00a0with raw food\ndo not\u00a0wash raw meat or poultry\u00a0\u2013\u00a0any harmful bacteria will be killed by thorough cooking, and washing may splash harmful bacteria around the kitchen\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. In most cases they don't cause any symptoms and don't need to be treated.\nHowever, if a gallstone becomes trapped in a duct (opening) inside the gallbladder it can trigger a sudden intense abdominal pain that usually lasts between 1\u00a0and 5\u00a0hours. This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic.\nSome people with gallstones\u00a0can also\u00a0develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), which can cause:\n\npersistent pain\njaundice\u00a0\na fever\n\nWhen gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it's known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. Read more about:\n\nsymptoms of gallstones\ncomplications of gallstones\n\nThe gallbladder\nThe gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile.\nBile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. It's passed from the liver through a series of channels, known as bile ducts, into the gallbladder.\nThe bile is stored in the gallbladder and over time it becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed.\nWhat causes\u00a0gallstones?\nGallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones.\nGallstones are very common. It's estimated that more than 1\u00a0in every 10 adults in the UK\u00a0has gallstones, although only\u00a0a minority\u00a0of\u00a0people develop symptoms.\nYou're more at risk of developing gallstones if you're:\n\noverweight\u00a0or obese\u00a0\nfemale, particularly if you've had children\n40 or over (the risk increases as you get older)\n\nRead more about:\n\ncauses of gallstones\u00a0\npreventing gallstones\n\nTreating gallstones\nTreatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing:\n\nsymptoms \u2013\u00a0such as abdominal pain\ncomplications \u2013 such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis\n\nIn these cases, keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended.\u00a0This procedure,\u00a0known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, is relatively simple\u00a0to perform and has a low risk of complications.\nYou can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. Your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but\u00a0the bile will just drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than\u00a0build up in the gallbladder.\nRead more about:\n\ntreating gallstones\ndiagnosing gallstones\n\nOutlook\nMost cases of gallstone disease are easily treated with surgery.\u00a0Very severe cases can be life-threatening, especially in people who are already in poor health. However, deaths from gallstone disease\u00a0are rare in the UK.\n\n\nMost cases of gallstones don't cause any symptoms. But if a gallstone blocks one of the bile ducts, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain, known as biliary colic.\nOther symptoms may develop\u00a0if the blockage is more severe or\u00a0develops in another part of the digestive system.\nAbdominal pain (biliary colic)\nGallstones\u00a0can cause\u00a0sudden, severe abdominal pain that usually lasts 1\u00a0to 5\u00a0hours\u00a0(although it can sometimes last just a few minutes).\nThe pain can be felt:\n\nin the centre of your abdomen (tummy)\njust under the ribs on your right-hand side \u2013\u00a0it may spread from here\u00a0to your side or shoulder blade\n\nThe pain is constant and isn't relieved when you go to the toilet, pass wind or are sick.\u00a0It's sometimes triggered by eating fatty foods, but\u00a0may occur at any time of day\u00a0and it may wake you up during the night.\nBiliary colic doesn't happen often. After an episode of pain, it may be several weeks or months before you experience another episode.\nSome people also have periods where they sweat excessively and feel sick or vomit.\nWhen\u00a0gallstones cause episodes of biliary colic, it is known as 'uncomplicated gallstone disease'.\nOther symptoms\nIn a small number of people, gallstones can cause more serious problems if they obstruct the flow of bile for longer periods or move into other organs (such as the pancreas or small bowel).\nIf this happens,\u00a0you\u00a0may develop:\n\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\nmore persistent pain\na rapid heartbeat\nyellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nitchy skin\ndiarrhoea\nchills or shivering attacks\nconfusion\na loss of appetite\n\nDoctors refer to this more severe condition as 'complicated gallstone disease'.\nRead more about the complications of gallstones.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you think you may be experiencing biliary colic, you should make an appointment with your GP.\nContact your GP immediately for advice if you develop:\n\njaundice\nabdominal pain lasting longer than eight hours\na high temperature and chills\nabdominal pain so intense that you can't find a position to relieve it\n\nIf\u00a0it's not possible to contact your GP immediately, phone your local\u00a0out-of-hours NHS 24 111 service.\n\n\nGallstones are thought to be caused by an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to aid digestion.\nIt's still unclear exactly what leads to this imbalance, but gallstones can form if:\n\nthere are unusually high levels of cholesterol inside the gallbladder (about 4\u00a0in every 5\u00a0gallstones are made up of cholesterol)\nthere are unusually high levels of a waste product called bilirubin inside the gallbladder (about 1\u00a0in every 5\u00a0gallstones is made up of bilirubin)\n\nThese chemical imbalances cause tiny crystals to develop in the bile. These can gradually grow (often over many years) into solid stones that can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pebble.\nSometimes only 1\u00a0stone will form, but there are often several at the same time.\nWho\u2019s at risk?\nGallstones are more common if you:\n\nare female, particularly if you've had children,\u00a0are taking the combined Pill, or are undergoing high-dose\u00a0oestrogen therapy\nare overweight or\u00a0obese\nare aged 40 years or older (the older you are, the more likely you are to develop gallstones)\nhave a condition that affects the flow of bile \u2013 such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), primary sclerosing cholangitis, or\u00a0obstetric cholestasis\u00a0\nhave Crohn's disease or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\nhave a close family member who's also had gallstones\nhave recently lost weight (from either\u00a0dieting or weight-loss surgery)\nare taking an antibiotic called ceftriaxone\n\n\n\nGallstones may be discovered during tests for a different condition, as they often don't cause any symptoms.\nIf you do have symptoms of gallstones,\u00a0make an appointment with your GP so they can try to identify the problem.\nSeeing your GP\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms in detail and may\u00a0carry out the Murphy's sign test to help determine if your gallbladder is inflamed.\nDuring this test, your\u00a0GP places their hand or fingers on the upper-right area of your tummy and asks you to breathe in. If you find this painful, it usually\u00a0means your gallbladder is inflamed and you may need urgent treatment.\nYour GP may also recommend having\u00a0blood tests to look for signs of infection, or to check if your liver is working normally.\u00a0If gallstones have moved into your bile duct, the liver may not be able to\u00a0function properly.\nFurther tests\nIf your symptoms and test results suggest you may have gallstones, you'll usually be referred for further tests. You may be admitted to hospital for tests the same day if your symptoms suggest you have a more severe form of gallbladder disease.\nGallstones can usually be confirmed using an ultrasound scan, which uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of the body.\nThe type of ultrasound scan used for gallstones\u00a0is similar to the scan used during pregnancy, where a small handheld device called a transducer is placed onto your skin and moved over your upper abdomen.\nSound waves are sent from the\u00a0transducer, through your skin and into your body. They bounce back off the body tissues, forming an image\u00a0on a monitor. This is a painless procedure that usually takes about 10-15 minutes to complete.\nWhen gallstones are diagnosed, there may be some uncertainty about whether any stones have passed into the bile duct.\nGallstones in the bile duct are sometimes seen during an ultrasound scan.\u00a0If they're not visible but your\u00a0tests\u00a0suggest the bile duct may be affected, you may need an MRI scan or a cholangiography.\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be carried out to look for gallstones in the bile ducts. This type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body.\nA procedure called a cholangiography can give further information about the condition of your gallbladder.\nA cholangiography uses a dye that shows up on X-rays. The dye\u00a0may be injected into your bloodstream or injected directly into your bile ducts during surgery or using an\u00a0endoscope\u00a0passed through your mouth.\nAfter the dye has been introduced, X-ray images are taken. They'll reveal any abnormality in your bile or pancreatic systems. If your gallbladder and bile systems are working normally, the dye will be absorbed in the places it's meant to go (your liver, bile ducts, intestines and gallbladder).\nIf a blockage is detected during this test, your doctor may try to remove\u00a0it at this point using an endoscope. This is known as\u00a0an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). See\u00a0treating gallstones for more information about ERCP.\nA computerised tomography (CT) scan may be carried out to look for any complications of gallstones, such as acute pancreatitis. This type of scan involves taking a series of X-rays from many different angles.\nCT scans are\u00a0often done\u00a0in an emergency to diagnose severe abdominal pain.\n\n\nYour treatment plan for gallstones depends on how the symptoms are affecting your daily life.\nIf you don't have any symptoms, a policy of 'active monitoring' is often recommended. This means you won't receive immediate treatment, but you should let your GP know if you notice any symptoms.\nAs a general rule, the longer you go without symptoms, the less likely it is that your condition will get worse.\nYou may need treatment if you have a condition that increases your risk of\u00a0developing complications, such as:\n\nscarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\nhigh blood pressure inside the liver \u2013 this is known as portal hypertension and is often a complication of\u00a0alcohol-related liver disease\ndiabetes\n\nTreatment may also be recommended if a scan shows high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, as this can lead to\u00a0gallbladder cancer in later life.\nIf you have episodes of abdominal pain (biliary colic), treatment depends on how the pain affects your daily activities. If\u00a0the episodes are\u00a0mild and infrequent, you may be prescribed painkillers to control further episodes and given advice about\u00a0eating a healthy diet to help control the pain.\nIf your symptoms are more severe and occur frequently,\u00a0surgery to remove the gallbladder\u00a0is usually recommended.\nThe gallbladder isn't an essential organ and\u00a0you can lead a perfectly normal life without one.\u00a0Some people may experience symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating fatty or spicy food. If certain foods do trigger symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future.\nKeyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder\nIf surgery is recommended, you'll usually have keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. This is known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nDuring\u00a0a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0small cuts are made in your abdomen. One larger cut (about 2-3cm) will be by the belly button and the others (each 1cm or less) will be on the right side of your abdomen.\nYour abdomen is temporarily inflated using carbon dioxide gas. This is harmless and makes it easier for the surgeon to see your organs.\nA\u00a0laparoscope (long thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera at the end) is inserted through one of the cuts in your abdomen. This allows your surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor.\u00a0Your surgeon will then remove your gallbladder using special surgical instruments.\nIf it's thought there may be gallstones in the bile duct, an X-ray or ultrasound scan of the bile duct is also taken during the operation. If gallstones are found, they may be removed during keyhole surgery. If the operation can't be done this way or an unexpected complication occurs, it may have to be converted to open surgery (see below).\nAfter the gallbladder has been removed, the gas in your abdomen escapes through the laparoscope and the cuts are closed with dissolvable stitches and covered with dressings.\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomies are\u00a0usually performed under a general anaesthetic, which means you'll be asleep during the procedure and won't feel any pain while it's carried out. The operation takes 60-90 minutes and you can usually go home the same\u00a0day.\u00a0Full recovery typically takes around 10 days.\nSingle-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a newer type of keyhole surgery used to remove the gallbladder. During this type of surgery, only one small cut is made, which means you'll only have one\u00a0barely visible scar.\nHowever, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies haven\u2019t been carried out as often as conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomies, so there are still some uncertainties about it. Access to this type of surgery is also limited because it needs an experienced surgeon with specialist training.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information on\u00a0single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nOpen surgery\nA\u00a0laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not always be recommended, for example if you:\n\nare in the third trimester (the last three months) of pregnancy\nare extremely overweight\nhave an unusual gallbladder or bile duct structure that makes a\u00a0keyhole procedure difficult and potentially dangerous\n\nIn these circumstances, an open cholecystectomy may be recommended. During this procedure, a 10-15cm (4-6in) incision is made in your abdomen underneath the ribs so the gallbladder can be removed.\u00a0This\u00a0is done under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep and won't feel any pain.\nOpen surgery is just as effective as laparoscopic surgery, but it does have a longer recovery time and causes more visible scarring. Most people have to stay in hospital for up to 5\u00a0days and it typically takes 6\u00a0weeks to fully recover.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP)\nAn endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure that can be used to remove gallstones from the bile duct. The gallbladder isn't removed during this procedure, so any stones in the gallbladder will remain unless removed using the surgical techniques mentioned above.\nERCP is similar to a diagnostic cholangiography (see diagnosing gallstones for more information), where an endoscope (long, thin flexible tube with a camera at the end) is passed through your mouth down to where the bile duct opens into the small intestine.\nHowever, during ERCP the\u00a0opening of the bile duct\u00a0is widened with a small incision or an electrically heated wire. The bile duct stones are then removed or left to pass into your intestine and out of your body.\nSometimes a small tube called a stent is permanently placed in the bile duct to help the bile and stones pass.\nAn ERCP is usually carried out under sedation, which means you'll be awake throughout the procedure but won't experience any pain.\nThe ERCP procedure\u00a0lasts about 30 minutes on average, but can take from 15 minutes to over an hour.\u00a0You may need to stay overnight in hospital after the procedure so you can be monitored.\nMedication to dissolve gallstones\nIf your\u00a0gallstones are small and don't contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid\u00a0tablets to dissolve them.\nHowever, these aren't\u00a0prescribed very often because:\n\nthey're\u00a0rarely very effective\nthey need to be taken for a long time (up to 2\u00a0years)\ngallstones can recur once treatment is stopped\n\nSide effects of ursodeoxycholic acid are uncommon and are usually mild. The most commonly reported side effects are feeling sick, being sick and itchy skin.\nThe use of ursodeoxycholic acid isn't usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Sexually active women should use either a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, or a low-dose oestrogen contraceptive pill while taking ursodeoxycholic acid, as it may affect other types of oral contraceptive pills.\nUrsodeoxycholic acid tablets are occasionally also prescribed as a precaution against gallstones if it's thought you're at risk of developing them. For example, you may be prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid if you've recently had weight loss surgery, as rapid weight loss can cause gallstones to grow.\n\n\nA small number of people with gallstones may develop serious problems if the gallstones cause a severe blockage or move into another part of the digestive system.\nInflammation of the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis)\nIn some cases of gallstone disease a bile duct can become permanently blocked, which can lead to a build-up of bile inside the gallbladder. This can cause the gallbladder to become infected and inflamed.\nThe medical term for inflammation of the gallbladder is acute cholecystitis. Symptoms include:\n\npain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade (unlike biliary colic, the pain usually lasts longer than five hours)\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\na rapid heartbeat\n\nAn estimated 1\u00a0in 7\u00a0people with acute cholecystitis also experience jaundice (see below).\nAcute cholecystitis is usually treated first with antibiotics to settle the infection and then keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder. This operation can be more difficult when performed as an emergency and there's a higher risk of it being converted to an open procedure.\nSometimes a\u00a0severe infection can lead to a gallbladder abscess (empyema of the gallbladder). Antibiotics alone don't always treat these and they may need to be drained.\nOccasionally a severely inflamed gallbladder\u00a0can tear, leading to\u00a0peritonitis\u00a0(inflammation of the inside lining of the abdomen).\u00a0If this happens, you may need to have antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenous antibiotics) and surgery may be required to remove a section of the lining if part of it becomes severely damaged.\nRead more about acute cholecystitis.\nJaundice\nIf a gallstone passes out of the gallbladder into the bile duct and blocks the flow of bile, jaundice occurs.\nSymptoms of jaundice include:\n\nyellowing of the skin and eyes\ndark brown urine\npale stools\nitching\n\nSometimes the stone passes from the bile duct on its own. If it doesn't, the stone needs to be removed. See treating gallstones.\nInfection of the bile ducts (acute cholangitis)\nIf the bile ducts become blocked, they're vulnerable to infection by bacteria. The medical term for a bile duct infection is acute cholangitis.\nSymptoms of acute cholangitis include:\n\npain in your upper abdomen that travels towards your shoulder blade\na high temperature\njaundice\nchills\nconfusion\nitchy skin\ngenerally feeling unwell\n\nAntibiotics will help treat the infection, but it's also important to help the bile from the liver to drain with an\u00a0endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP). See treating gallstones for more information.\nAcute pancreatitis\nAcute pancreatitis\u00a0may develop when a gallstone moves out of the gallbladder and blocks the opening (duct) of the pancreas, causing it to become inflamed.\nThe most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is a sudden severe dull pain in the centre of your upper abdomen, around the top of your stomach.\nThe pain of acute pancreatitis often gets steadily worse until it reaches a constant ache. The ache may travel from your abdomen and along your back and may feel worse after you have eaten. Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain.\nOther symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:\n\nfeeling sick\nbeing sick\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nloss of appetite\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\ntenderness of the abdomen\nless commonly, jaundice\n\nThere's currently no cure for acute pancreatitis, so treatment focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed.\nThis usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given:\n\nfluids into a vein (intravenous fluids)\npain relief\nnutritional support\noxygen through tubes into your nose\n\nWith treatment,\u00a0most people with acute pancreatitis improve within a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5-10 days.\nRead more about acute pancreatitis.\nCancer of the gallbladder\nGallbladder cancer\u00a0is a rare but serious complication of gallstones. An estimated 660 cases of gallbladder cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year.\nHaving a history of gallstones increases your risk of developing gallbladder cancer.\u00a0Approximately 4\u00a0out of every 5\u00a0people who have cancer of the gallbladder also have a history of gallstones.\nHowever, people with a history of gallstones have a less than one in 10,000 chance of developing gallbladder cancer.\nIf you have additional risk factors, such as a family history of gallbladder cancer or high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, it may be recommended that your gallbladder be removed as a precaution, even if your gallstones aren't causing any symptoms.\nThe symptoms of gallbladder cancer are similar to those of complicated gallstone disease, including:\n\nabdominal pain\nhigh temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\njaundice\n\nGallbladder cancer can be treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nGallstone ileus\nAnother rare but serious complication of gallstones is known as gallstone ileus. This is where the bowel becomes obstructed by a gallstone.\nGallstone ileus can occur when an abnormal channel, known as a fistula, opens up near the gallbladder. Gallstones are then able to travel through the fistula and can block the bowel.\nSymptoms of gallstone ileus include:\n\nabdominal pain\nbeing sick\nswelling of the abdomen\u00a0\nconstipation\n\nA bowel obstruction requires immediate medical treatment. If it's not treated, there's a risk that the bowel could split open (rupture). This could cause internal bleeding and widespread infection.\nIf you suspect you have an obstructed bowel, contact your GP as soon as possible. If this isn't possible, phone the\u00a0NHS 24 111 service.\nSurgery is usually required to remove the gallstone and unblock the bowel. The type of surgery you receive depends on where in the bowel the obstruction has occurred.\n\n\nFrom the limited evidence available, changes to your diet and losing weight (if you're overweight) may help prevent gallstones.\nDiet\nBecause of the role cholesterol appears to play in the formation of gallstones, it is advisable to avoid eating too many foods with a high saturated fat\u00a0content.\nFoods high in saturated fat include:\n\nmeat pies\nsausages and fatty cuts of meat\nbutter, ghee and lard\ncream\nhard cheeses\u00a0\ncakes and biscuits\nfood containing coconut or palm oil\n\nA healthy, balanced diet is recommended. This includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5\u00a0portions a day) and wholegrains.\nThere's also evidence that regularly eating nuts, such as peanuts or cashews, can help reduce\u00a0your risk of developing gallstones.\u00a0\nDrinking small amounts of alcohol may also\u00a0help reduce your risk of gallstones. However, you shouldn't regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week as this can lead to liver problems and other health conditions. Regularly drinking any amount of alcohol can increase the risk to your health.\nRead more about:\u00a0\n\nhigh cholesterol\nhow to lower your cholesterol\nhealthy eating\n\nLosing weight\nBeing overweight, particularly being obese, increases the amount of cholesterol in your bile, which increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should control your weight by eating a healthy diet and taking plenty of regular exercise.\nHowever, avoid low-calorie, rapid-weight-loss diets. There's evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is recommended.\nRead more about\u00a0losing weight and getting started with exercise.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition, where acid from the stomach leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet).\nIt usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened.

This causes\u00a0symptoms of GORD, which can include heartburn and acid reflux.\nIt's not always clear what causes this\u00a0ring of muscle\u00a0to become weakened, but certain things can increase the risk of\u00a0it happening (see below).\nWho's most at risk of GORD?\nThe following factors may\u00a0increase your risk of developing GORD:\n\nbeing overweight or obese\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can place increased pressure on your stomach and weaken the\u00a0muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus\neating large amounts of fatty foods \u2013\u00a0the stomach takes longer to\u00a0get rid\u00a0of stomach acid after digesting a fatty meal and the resulting excess acid may leak up into the oesophagus\nsmoking, alcohol, coffee or chocolate \u2013 these may relax the muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus\npregnancy \u2013\u00a0temporary changes in hormone levels\u00a0and increased pressure on your stomach during pregnancy can cause GORD\nhiatus hernia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0when part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm (thin sheet of muscle between the chest and tummy)\ngastroparesis\u00a0\u2013 when the stomach takes longer to\u00a0get rid\u00a0of stomach acid, which means\u00a0excess acid can leak up into the oesophagus\ncertain medicines \u2013 some medicines can cause GORD or make the symptoms worse, including\u00a0calcium-channel blockers (used to treat high blood pressure),\u00a0nitrates (used to treat\u00a0angina) and\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nstress\n\nGORD can sometimes affect several members of the same family and it's been suggested that the genes you inherit from your parents may also affect your chances of\u00a0developing the condition.\n\n\nYour GP will often be able to diagnose\u00a0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) based on your symptoms.\nThey may prescribe medication to treat it without needing to carry out any tests. Read more about treating GORD.\nWhen tests may be needed\nYou'll usually only need to be\u00a0referred for tests in hospital if:\n\nyour GP is unsure whether you have GORD\nyour symptoms are persistent, severe or unusual\nprescription medications aren't controlling your symptoms\nyour GP thinks you might benefit from surgery\nyou have signs of a potentially more severe condition, such as difficulty swallowing\u00a0or\u00a0unexplained weight loss\n\nTests can help to confirm the diagnosis of GORD, check for other possible causes of your symptoms and determine whether you may be suitable for surgery.\nTests for GORD\nTests you may have include:\n\nan\u00a0endoscopy\na\u00a0barium swallow or barium meal test\nmanometry\n24-hour pH monitoring\nblood tests\n\nAn\u00a0endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using an endoscope, which is a long, thin, flexible tube with\u00a0a light and camera at one end.\nThe endoscope will be gently inserted into your mouth and down your throat. The procedure is usually carried out while you're awake, but you may be given a sedative to help you relax.\nThe camera can show\u00a0if the surface of your oesophagus (gullet) has been damaged by stomach acid, although this doesn't happen to everyone with GORD.\nA barium swallow, or barium meal, is a test to assess your swallowing ability and look for any blockages or abnormalities in your oesophagus.\nYou are first given some barium solution, then some\u00a0X-rays\u00a0are taken.\u00a0Barium is a harmless substance that shows up clearly on X-rays as it passes through your digestive system.\nYou'll be asked not to\u00a0eat anything for a few hours before the procedure. Afterwards, you'll be able to eat and drink normally, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your body.\nManometry is used to assess how well the ring of muscle at the end of your oesophagus is working, by measuring the pressure in your oesophagus.\nThis can rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and\u00a0can help determine whether surgery would be suitable.\nDuring the procedure,\u00a0a small tube will be passed up your nose and then down into your oesophagus. The tube contains pressure sensors that can detect the pressure in the oesophagus.\nIt may be necessary to measure the acidity level (pH) in your oesophagus to confirm a diagnosis of GORD if nothing is found during an endoscopy.\nThe acidity level is measured over 24 hours, using a thin tube containing a sensor that's passed up your nose and down your oesophagus. This is usually connected to a recording device worn on your waist.\nYou'll be asked to press a button on the recorder every time you become aware of your symptoms and to record your symptoms in a diary. You should eat as you normally would during the test to ensure an accurate result.\nSometimes a\u00a0blood test may be carried out to check for\u00a0anaemia, which can be a sign of internal bleeding.\u00a0\n\n\nHeartburn and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can often be treated with self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines.\nIf these don't help, your GP can prescribe stronger medication or refer you to a specialist to discuss whether surgery may be an option.\nThis page covers:\nSelf-help for GORD\nMedicines for GORD\nSurgery for GORD\nSelf-help\nYou may find the following measures can help reduce heartburn and other symptoms of GORD:\n\nEat smaller and more frequent meals, rather than 3\u00a0large meals a day \u2013\u00a0don't eat or drink alcohol within 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0hours before going to bed, and avoid having your largest meal of the day in the evening.\nAvoid anything you think triggers your symptoms \u2013 common triggers include\u00a0coffee, chocolate, tomatoes, alcohol,\u00a0and fatty or spicy food.\nDon't wear tight clothing \u2013 clothes that are tight around your tummy may make your symptoms worse.\nRaise the head of your bed\u00a0by\u00a0up to 20cm (8 inches) \u2013 placing a piece of wood or blocks underneath one end of your bed\u00a0may reduce symptoms at night; don't just use extra pillows, as this can put a strain on your tummy.\nTry\u00a0to relax \u2013 stress can make heartburn and GORD worse, so learning\u00a0relaxation techniques may help if you're often feeling stressed.\nMaintain a healthy weight \u2013 if you're overweight,\u00a0losing weight may\u00a0help\u00a0reduce your symptoms.\nStop smoking\u00a0\u2013 smoke can irritate your digestive system and\u00a0may make\u00a0your symptoms worse.\n\nIf you're taking medication for other health conditions, check with your GP to find out whether they could be contributing to your symptoms.\nDifferent\u00a0medicines may be available, but don't stop taking any prescribed medication without consulting your GP first.\nMedication\nA number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of GORD.\nOver-the-counter heartburn and GORD medicines are available from pharmacies without a prescription. The main types are:\n\nantacids\u00a0\u2013 these\u00a0neutralise the effects of stomach acid\nalginates \u2013\u00a0these\u00a0produce a coating that protects the stomach and oesophagus (gullet) from stomach acid\nlow-dose proton-pump inhibitors and\u00a0H2-receptor antagonists \u2013\u00a0see below for more information about these\u00a0\n\nThese medicines aren't suitable for everyone, so you should check the leaflet first. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're not sure.\nIf your symptoms don't get better despite trying self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines, your GP may prescribe a PPI. These work by reducing the amount of acid\u00a0produced by your stomach.\nYou'll usually be given enough medication to last a month. Go back to your GP if they don't\u00a0help or your symptoms return after treatment finishes.\u00a0Some people need to take\u00a0PPIs on a long-term basis.\nThe possible side effects of PPIs are usually mild. They include headaches, diarrhoea\u00a0or\u00a0constipation, feeling sick, abdominal pain, dizziness\u00a0and a rash.\nYour GP will prescribe the lowest dose that they think will control your symptoms to reduce the risk of side effects.\nIf PPIs don't control your symptoms, a medicine known as a H2RA may be recommended for you to take alongside them on a short-term basis, or as an alternative.\nLike PPIs, H2RAs reduce the amount of acid produced by\u00a0your stomach.\nSide effects of H2RAs are uncommon, but can\u00a0include diarrhoea, headaches, dizziness, a\u00a0rash and tiredness.\nSurgery and procedures\nSurgery may be an option if:\n\nthe above treatments don't help,\u00a0aren't suitable for you, or\u00a0cause troublesome side effects\nyou don't want to take medication on a long-term basis\n\nThe main procedure used is called\u00a0a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF).\u00a0Alternative\u00a0techniques have been developed more recently,\u00a0although these aren't yet widely available.\nLNF is a type of laparoscopic or \"keyhole\" surgery. This means it's carried out using special surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the skin.\nThe procedure is used to tighten the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus,\u00a0which helps to stop acid leaking up from the stomach. It's carried out in hospital under general anaesthetic.\nMost people need to stay in hospital for 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0days after the procedure. Depending on your job, you may be able to return to work within 3\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks.\nFor the first 6\u00a0weeks after surgery, you should only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Some people experience problems with swallowing, belching and bloating after LNF,\u00a0but these should get better with time.\nIn the last few years, several new techniques for treating GORD have been developed.\nThe\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says these procedures appear to be safe, but\u00a0not much\u00a0is known about their long-term effects.\nThese techniques include:\n\nEndoscopic injection of bulking agents\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where special filler is injected into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make\u00a0it narrower.\nEndoluminal gastroplication\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where folds are sown into the ring of muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus to restrict how far it can open.\nEndoscopic augmentation with hydrogel implants\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where implants containing\u00a0special\u00a0gel\u00a0are placed\u00a0into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower.\nEndoscopic radiofrequency ablation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a tiny balloon is passed down to the bottom of\u00a0the oesophagus and electrodes attached to it are used to heat it and make it narrower.\nLaparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band (LINX)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a ring of magnetic beads are implanted around the lower part of the oesophagus to strengthen it and help keep it closed when not swallowing.\n\nSpeak to your surgeon about these techniques for more information.\n\n\nA number of possible complications can occur as a result of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) for a long time.\nOesophageal ulcers\nThe\u00a0stomach acid that leaks into the oesophagus in people with GORD can damage the lining of\u00a0the oesophagus (oesophagitis), which can cause ulcers to form.\nThese ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making it difficult to swallow.\nMedications used to treat GORD, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can help ulcers heal by reducing the amount of acid that leaks into the oesophagus. Read more about treatments for GORD.\nScarred and narrow oesophagus\nRepeated damage to the oesophagus by stomach acid can also cause it to become scarred and narrowed.\nThis is known as oesophageal stricture and it\u00a0can make swallowing difficult and painful.\nIf this happens,\u00a0a procedure to widen the oesophagus using a small balloon or other widening device may be recommended.\nBarrett's oesophagus\nRepeated episodes of GORD can sometimes lead to changes in the cells in the\u00a0lining of your lower oesophagus. This is known as Barrett's oesophagus.\nIt's estimated that about 1 in every 10 people with GORD will develop Barrett's oesophagus, usually\u00a0after many years.\nBarrett's oesophagus doesn't usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those caused by GORD.\nHowever, there's a small risk that the changed cells could become cancerous in the future (see below). Your doctor may suggest having an endoscopy\u00a0every few years to check for this.\nOesophageal cancer\nIt's estimated that 1 in every 10-20 people with\u00a0Barrett's oesophagus will develop oesophageal cancer\u00a0within 10-20 years.\nSymptoms of oesophageal cancer include:\n\ndifficulty swallowing\nunexplained weight loss\npersistent\u00a0indigestion\nhoarseness\na persistent\u00a0cough and/or\u00a0coughing blood\nvomiting\n\nSpeak to your doctor\u00a0if you experience any swallowing difficulties, or any other unusual or persistent symptoms.\nSurgery to remove the cancer can be carried out if it's\u00a0diagnosed at an early stage.\nRead more about\u00a0treatments for oesophageal cancer.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Glandular fever is a type of viral infection that mostly affects young adults.\nIt is also known as\u00a0infectious mononucleosis, or \"mono\".\nCommon symptoms include:\n\na high temperature (fever)\na severely\u00a0sore throat\nswollen glands\u00a0in the neck\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\n\nWhile the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks.

This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through:\n\nkissing\u00a0\u2013 glandular fever is often referred to as the \"kissing disease\"\nexposure to coughs and sneezes\nsharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery\n\nEBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever for several months after their symptoms pass, and some people may\u00a0continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years.\nIf you have EBV, it's a good idea to take steps to avoid infecting others\u00a0while you are ill,\u00a0such as not kissing other people, but there's no need\u00a0no need to\u00a0avoid all contact with others\u00a0as the chances of passing on the infection are generally low.\nRead more about the causes of glandular fever.\nWho is affected?\nGlandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults.\nMost EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only\u00a0mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.\nHowever, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever.\nOnce you have had glandular fever, it is unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection.\nHow glandular fever is diagnosed\nTo\u00a0diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask\u00a0about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They will look for characteristic signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen.\nYour GP may also recommend a\u00a0blood test to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, mumps\u00a0and toxoplasmosis.\nHow glandular fever is treated\nThere is no cure for glandular fever, but there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to\u00a0control the infection.\nThese include:\n\ndrinking plenty of fluids\ntaking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol\u00a0or\u00a0ibuprofen\ngetting plenty of rest and\u00a0gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve\n\nOccasionally,\u00a0antibiotics or\u00a0corticosteroids may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever.\nSome people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days.\nRead more about\u00a0treating glandular fever.\nPossible complications\nComplications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include:\n\nfurther infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver\u00a0and lungs\nsevere anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells)\nbreathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming\u00a0significantly swollen\na ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery\n\nRead more about the\u00a0complications of glandular fever.\n\n\nSymptoms of glandular fever are thought to take around one to two months to develop after infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).\nMain symptoms\nThe\u00a0most common\u00a0symptoms of the condition are:\n\na high temperature (fever)\na\u00a0sore throat\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this is usually more painful than any you may have had before\nswollen glands\u00a0in your neck and possibly in other parts of your body, such as under your armpits\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\n\nOther symptoms\nGlandular fever can also cause:\n\na general sense of feeling unwell\naching muscles\nchills\nsweats\nloss of appetite\npain around or behind your eyes\nswollen tonsils and adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose), which may affect your breathing\nthe inside of your throat to become very red and ooze fluid\nsmall red or purple spots on the roof of your mouth\na rash\nswelling or \"puffiness\" around your eyes\na tender or swollen tummy\njaundice\u00a0(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\n\nSome of these symptoms may develop a few days before the main symptoms\u00a0mentioned above.\nHow the condition progresses\nMost symptoms of glandular fever will\u00a0usually resolve within two or three weeks.\u00a0Your throat will normally feel most\u00a0sore\u00a0for three to five days after symptoms start before gradually improving, and your fever will usually last 10 to 14 days.\nFatigue is the most persistent symptom and\u00a0often lasts a few weeks, although some people may feel persistently fatigued for several months after the other symptoms have passed.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever.\nWhile there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment other than provide advice and support, blood tests\u00a0may be needed to rule out less common but more serious causes of your symptoms, such as hepatitis\u00a0(a viral infection that affects the liver).\nYou should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department\u00a0or dial 999 for an ambulance\u00a0if you have glandular fever and you:\n\ndevelop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties\nfind swallowing fluids difficult\ndevelop\u00a0intense abdominal pain\n\nIf you have these symptoms, you may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days.\nRead more about treating glandular fever.\n\n\nGlandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is most often spread through the saliva of someone who carries the infection.\nFor example, it can be spread through:\n\nkissing\u00a0\u2013 glandular fever is sometimes referred to as the \"kissing disease\"\nsharing food and drinks\nsharing toothbrushes\nexposure to coughs and sneezes\n\nSmall children may be infected by chewing toys that have been contaminated with the virus.\nWhen you come into contact with infected saliva, the virus can infect the cells on the lining of your throat.\nThe infection is then passed into your white blood cells before spreading through the lymphatic system.\nThis is a series of glands (nodes) found throughout your body that allows many of the cells that your immune system needs to travel around the body.\nAfter the infection has passed, people develop lifelong immunity to the virus and most won't develop symptoms again.\nMany people are first exposed to EBV during childhood, when the infection causes few symptoms and often goes unrecognised before it eventually passes.\nYoung adults may be most at risk of glandular fever because they might not have been exposed to the virus when they were younger, and the infection tends to produce more severe symptoms when you're older.\nEBV carriers\nNot everyone who can pass on EBV will have symptoms themselves. These are known as asymptomatic carriers.\nSome people can have the virus in their saliva for a few months after recovering from glandular fever, and may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years.\nThis is because the virus remains inactive in the body for the rest of your life after you have been exposed to it. For most people, the inactive virus won't cause any symptoms.\nHowever, there is a chance of the virus periodically becoming reactivated, which may mean it re-enters the saliva. This reactivation may be without any symptoms, or it\u00a0may cause symptoms to recur for a short time.\n\n\nThere is currently no cure for glandular fever, but the symptoms should pass within a few weeks. There are things you can do to help control your symptoms.\nFluids\nIt is important to drink plenty of fluids\u00a0(preferably water or unsweetened fruit juice) to avoid dehydration.\nAvoid alcohol, as this could\u00a0harm your liver, which may already be weakened from the infection.\nPainkillers\nPainkillers available over the counter, such as paracetamol or\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0such as ibuprofen, can help reduce pain and fever.\nChildren under 16 years old should not take aspirin because there is a small risk\u00a0it could trigger a rare but serious health condition called\u00a0Reye's syndrome.\nRegularly gargling with a solution of warm, salty water may also help relieve your\u00a0sore throat.\nRest\nIt is important\u00a0you take plenty of rest while you recover from glandular fever, although complete bed rest is no longer recommended because it\u00a0may make the fatigue last longer.\nYou should gradually increase your activities as your energy levels return, but avoid activities you cannot manage comfortably.\nFor the first month after your symptoms begin, avoid contact sports or activities that put you at risk of falling. This is because you may have a swollen spleen that\u00a0it is more vulnerable to damage, and a sudden knock could cause it to burst (rupture).\nPreventing the spread of infection\nThere is no need to be isolated from others if you have glandular fever\u00a0as most people will already be immune to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).\nYou can return to work, college or school as soon as you feel well enough. There is little risk of spreading the infection to others as long as you follow commonsense precautions while you are ill, such as not kissing other people or sharing utensils.\nIt is also important to\u00a0thoroughly clean anything that may have been contaminated by saliva until you have recovered.\nAntibiotics and steroids\nAntibiotics\u00a0are not effective in treating glandular fever because they have no effect on viruses,\u00a0but they\u00a0may be prescribed if you also develop a bacterial infection of\u00a0your throat or lungs (pneumonia).\nA short course of\u00a0corticosteroids may also be helpful if:\n\nyour tonsils are particularly swollen\u00a0and\u00a0are causing breathing difficulties\nyou have severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells)\nyou have\u00a0problems affecting your heart, such as pericarditis (inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart)\nyou have\u00a0problems affecting your brain or nerves, such as encephalitis\n\nRead more about\u00a0the complications of glandular fever.\nHospital treatment\nMost people are able to recover from glandular fever\u00a0at home, but hospital treatment may be necessary for a few days if you or your child:\n\ndevelop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties\nfind swallowing fluids difficult\ndevelop intense abdominal pain\n\nTreatment in hospital may involve receiving fluids or antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously), corticosteroid injections and pain relief.\nIn\u00a0a small number of\u00a0cases, emergency surgery to remove\u00a0the spleen (splenectomy) may be needed if it ruptures.\n\n\nMost people with glandular fever will recover in two or three weeks and won't experience any further problems.\nHowever, complications can develop in a few cases. Some of the main complications associated with the condition are described below.\nProlonged fatigue\nMore than\u00a01 in every 10 people with glandular fever will experience prolonged fatigue, which lasts for six months or more after the initial infection. It is not known why fatigue lasts longer in some people.\nSome experts think it may be a form of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This is a poorly understood condition that causes persistent fatigue and a range of other symptoms, such as headaches and joint pain.\nAdopting a gradual exercise plan to rebuild your strength and energy levels may help\u00a0prevent and reduce prolonged fatigue.\nReduction in\u00a0blood cells\nIn a few cases, glandular fever can lead to a reduction in some blood cells. It can reduce levels of:\n\nred blood cells (anaemia)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can make you feel tired and out of breath\nwhite blood cells (neutropenia)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can make you more prone to developing a secondary infection\nplatelets \u2013 this can make you bruise and bleed more easily\n\nIn most cases, the reduction in the\u00a0number of blood cells is small and only causes mild symptoms. These problems should get better by themselves within a few weeks or months.\nRuptured spleen\nAround half of people who develop glandular fever will have a swollen spleen. This does not present any immediate health problems, but\u00a0there is a small risk of it rupturing (bursting).\nThe main sign of a ruptured spleen is\u00a0sharp pain in the left of the tummy (abdomen).\nGo to\u00a0your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or dial 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you develop intense abdominal pain.\nThe risk of the spleen rupturing is small, occurring in just\u00a01 in every 500 to 1,000 cases of glandular fever, but it can be life threatening because it may cause severe internal bleeding.\nIn some cases,\u00a0emergency surgery may be required to remove an enlarged or\u00a0ruptured spleen\u00a0(splenectomy).\nA ruptured spleen usually occurs as a result of damage caused by vigorous physical activities, such as contact sports.\nIt is therefore very important to avoid these activities for at least a month after the symptoms of glandular fever begin.\nBe particularly careful during the second and third week of your illness, as this is when the spleen is most vulnerable.\nNeurological complications\nIn less than\u00a01 in every 100 cases, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can affect the nervous system and trigger a range of neurological complications, including:\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\u00a0\u2013 where the nerves become inflamed, causing symptoms such as numbness, weakness\u00a0and temporary paralysis\nBell's palsy\u00a0\u2013 where\u00a0the muscles on one side of the face become\u00a0temporarily weak or paralysed\nviral meningitis \u2013 an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord; although unpleasant,\u00a0viral meningitis\u00a0is much less serious than bacterial meningitis, which is life threatening\nencephalitis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the brain\n\nThese complications will often need specific treatment, but more than four out of every five people with them will make a full recovery.\nSecondary infection\nIn a small number of cases, the initial infection weakens your immune system and allows bacteria to infect parts of the body. This is called a secondary bacterial infection.\nPossible secondary infections that can develop during glandular fever include serious conditions such as pneumonia (infection of the lung) and\u00a0pericarditis (infection of the sac that surrounds the heart).\nSecondary infections usually occur in people who have a very weak immune system, such as people with HIV or AIDS, or those having\u00a0chemotherapy.\nIf you have a weakened immune system and you develop glandular fever, as a precaution you may be referred to hospital for specialist treatment. This will\u00a0allow for\u00a0your health to be carefully monitored and any secondary infections to be treated.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Gout is a type of arthritis in which small crystals form inside and around the joints. It causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling.\nIt's estimated that between one and two in every 100 people in the UK\u00a0are affected by gout.\nThe condition mainly affects men over 30 and women after the menopause. Overall, gout is more common in men than women.\nGout can be extremely painful and debilitating, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms and prevent further attacks.\nSigns and symptoms of gout\nAny joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints\u00a0towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers.\nSigns and symptoms of gout include:\n\nsevere pain in\u00a0one or more\u00a0joints\nthe joint feeling hot and very tender\nswelling in and around the affected joint\nred, shiny skin over the affected joint\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSymptoms develop rapidly\u00a0over a few hours and typically last\u00a0three to 10 days.

These crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful.\nThings that may increase your chances of getting gout include:\n\nobesity, high blood pressure\u00a0and/or\u00a0diabetes\nhaving a close relative with gout\nkidney problems\neating foods that cause\u00a0a build-up of uric acid, such as red meat, offal and seafood\ndrinking too much beer\u00a0or spirits\n\nRead more about the causes of gout.\nTreatments for gout\nIf you have gout, treatment is available from your GP to:\n\nrelieve symptoms\u00a0during an attack \u2013\u00a0this can be done using ice packs and by taking medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine or\u00a0corticosteroids\nprevent\u00a0further attacks \u2013 through a combination of\u00a0lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing your diet, and taking medication\u00a0that lowers uric acid\u00a0levels, such as\u00a0allopurinol\u00a0\n\nWith treatment, many people are able to reduce their uric acid levels sufficiently to dissolve the crystals that cause gout \u2013 and as a result have no further attacks. However, lifelong treatment is usually required.\nRead more about treating gout.\nCan gout cause further problems?\nSometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it's left untreated.\nThese can include:\n\nkidney stones\nsmall firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi\npermanent joint damage\n\nRead more about the complications of gout.\nWhat's pseudogout?\nPseudogout is\u00a0a similar condition to gout,\u00a0but usually\u00a0affects the knee joint first. It's a form of arthritis that causes pain, stiffness, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in one or more of your joints - commonly the knee or wrist.\u00a0\n\n\nThe main symptom of gout is a sudden attack of severe pain in one or more joints, typically your big toe.\nOther symptoms can include:\n\nthe joint feeling hot and very tender, to the point of\u00a0being unable to bear anything touching it\nswelling in and around the affected joint\nred, shiny skin over the affected joint\npeeling, itchy and flaky skin as the swelling goes down\n\nThe intense pain can make getting around difficult. Even the light pressure of a bed cover or blanket can be unbearable.\nWhich joints\u00a0can be\u00a0affected?\nGout can affect almost any joint and can occur in more than one joint at the same time.\nThe joints towards the ends of the limbs tend to be affected more often, including the:\n\ntoes\u00a0\u2013 particularly the big toe joint\nmidfoot (where your shoelaces sit)\nankles\u00a0\nknees\nfingers\nwrists\nelbows\n\nIf gout is left untreated, it's\u00a0likely to affect more joints over time.\nPattern of symptoms\nAttacks\u00a0of gout tend to:\n\noccur at night, although they can\u00a0happen at any time\ndevelop\u00a0quickly over a few hours\nlast between three and 10 days \u2013 after this time, the affected joint should start to return to normal, but the problem can persist if treatment isn't started early\ncome back\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may\u00a0experience attacks every few months or years\nbecome more frequent over time if not treated\n\nIt's difficult to predict how often attacks will occur and when exactly they will happen.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn't been previously diagnosed.\nContact your GP immediately or call the 111 service\u00a0if you have both:\n\nsevere, worsening joint pain and swelling\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n\nThis could mean you have an infection inside the joint (septic arthritis).\nIf you've already\u00a0been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if\u00a0any medication you've been prescribed doesn't start working within a couple of\u00a0days.\nRead more about diagnosing gout\u00a0and treating gout.\n\n\nGout is caused by small crystals forming in the joints, resulting in severe pain, tenderness and swelling.\nThese crystals can grow when a waste product called uric acid starts to build up to high levels in\u00a0the body.\nUric acid\nUric acid is created when the body breaks down chemicals known as purines.\nIf your kidneys don't filter out enough uric acid, or your body is producing unusually high levels of it, it can build up in the body and turn into microscopic crystals.\nThese crystals usually form in and around the joints, possibly because the temperature in these areas is slightly lower than the rest of the body. If they get into the space between joints, the crystals can cause painful inflammation (redness and swelling).\nWhat can increase your risk?\nA high level of uric acid in the blood is the main factor that increases your risk of developing gout. However, it's still uncertain why some people with a high level of uric acid in the blood develop gout, while others with an equally high level don't.\nOther factors that may increase your risk of developing gout are outlined below.\nSome underlying medical conditions can increase your risk of developing gout, including:\n\nhigh blood pressure\ndiabetes\nkidney disease\nhigh levels of fat and cholesterol in your blood\nobesity\nmetabolic syndrome\u00a0(a\u00a0combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity)\npsoriasis (a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales)\nosteoarthritis\n\nCertain medications can increase your uric acid levels and your risk of developing gout. These include:\n\ndiuretics (water tablets)\u00a0\u2013 used to treat high blood pressure or an abnormal build-up of fluid in your body\ncertain\u00a0medicines used to treat high blood pressure\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors\nlow-dose aspirin\u00a0\u2013 used to reduce the risk of\u00a0blood clots\nniacin\u00a0\u2013\u00a0used to treat high cholesterol\nciclosporin\u00a0\u2013 used to treat conditions such as\u00a0psoriasis\nsome\u00a0chemotherapy medicines\n\nUric acid is created when the body breaks down purines. Eating foods that contain a high level of purines can increase your risk of gout.\nFoods naturally high in purines include:\n\nred meat\u00a0\u2013 such as beef, lamb and pork\u00a0\nseafood\u00a0\u2013 especially shellfish and oily fish\noffal\u00a0\u2013 such as liver, kidneys and heart\n\nAlcoholic drinks can raise the level of uric acid in the blood.\nBeer, fortified wines like port, and spirits do this more than wine. Moderate consumption of wine \u2013 one or two glasses a day \u2013 shouldn't significantly increase your risk of gout.\nCertain sugary drinks may also increase your risk of gout.\nSome research has\u00a0found that drinking sugar-sweetened soft drinks and drinks with high levels of fructose (a naturally occurring sugar found in many\u00a0fruits)\u00a0had an\u00a0increased risk of gout.\nStudies have shown that gout often runs in families. Around\u00a0one in five people with gout have a close family member with the condition.\n\n\nYour GP may suspect gout based on your symptoms. Sometimes further tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes.\nSeeing your GP\nSee your GP if you experience\u00a0symptoms of gout for the first time.\nYour GP will\u00a0ask about\u00a0your symptoms and\u00a0medical history, and examine the affected area, to help make a diagnosis.\nThey\u00a0may also ask you about your diet, particularly your intake of beer, spirits and foods high in purines, such as red meat and seafood.\nFurther tests\nMany conditions can cause gout-like symptoms.\nYour GP may be unable to make a firm diagnosis straight away and you may be referred for further tests. These will either confirm the diagnosis of gout or rule out other conditions.\nA sample of fluid may be taken from the affected joint.\u00a0The fluid can be checked for the small crystals that cause gout,\u00a0and it can be tested for infection to rule out septic arthritis.\nA blood test known as a\u00a0serum uric acid test\u00a0may be used to measure the amount of uric acid in your blood. A high level or uric acid is often associated with gout.\nIt\u2019s sometimes best to wait until two to four weeks after an attack of gout before this test is carried out, as the level of uric acid in your blood is often not raised at the time of an attack. This is because the level of uric acid in your blood can drop when uric acid crystals form in the joints.\nAn\u00a0X-ray is rarely used to diagnose gout because the condition isn't usually detectable using this method.\nHowever, an X-ray is sometimes used to help rule out similar conditions that affect the joints, such as chondrocalcinosis (a build-up of calcium crystals in the joints) or to assess whether there has been any joint damage due to repeated or persistent attacks of gout.\nAn\u00a0ultrasound scan of an affected joint is a simple and safe investigation that's increasingly used to detect crystals in the joints. It can also detect crystals\u00a0deep\u00a0in the skin that aren't obvious during a physical examination.\n\n\nTreatment for gout includes pain relief to help you cope with a gout attack, as well as medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks.\nPain relief for a gout attack\nYou should:\n\ntake any medication you've been prescribed as early as possible after you notice an attack (see below) \u2013 this should start to have an effect within two or three days\nrest and raise the limb\navoid knocking or damaging the affected joint\nkeep the joint cool \u2013 remove surrounding clothing and apply an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel\nensure you're well hydrated\n\nApply the ice pack to your joint for around 20 minutes. Don't apply ice directly to your skin and don't apply it for more than 20 minutes at a time because this could damage the skin.\nIf necessary, you can keep reapplying an ice pack to your skin during an attack, but you should wait until your skin has returned to a normal temperature first.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually recommended as the first\u00a0treatment for gout. They work by reducing pain and inflammation during an attack.\nNSAIDs used to treat gout include naproxen, diclofenac and etoricoxib.\nIf you've been prescribed NSAIDs, it's a good idea\u00a0to have them with you at all times so you can use them at the first sign of a gout attack. Continue to take your medication throughout the attack and for 48 hours afterwards.\nYour GP may also prescribe a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), to take alongside your NSAID. This\u00a0reduces the risk of the NSAID causing indigestion,\u00a0stomach ulcers and bleeding from the stomach.\nIf you're unable to take NSAIDs or if NSAIDs are ineffective, a medicine called\u00a0colchicine can be used instead.\nColchicine reduces some of the swelling and pain associated with a gout attack.\nIt's best to have it with you at all times so you can use it at the first sign of a gout attack. Your GP will tell you how long to take it for and how often.\nWhen taken in high doses, side effects of colchicine include feeling sick, abdominal (tummy) pain and diarrhoea.\nCorticosteroids\u00a0are sometimes used to treat severe cases of gout if other treatments don't work or you're unable to take an NSAID or colchicine.\nA short course of steroid tablets often provides relief, but they can't be used long-term in high doses as they cause side effects, including:\u00a0\n\nweight gain\nthinning of the bones (osteoporosis)\neasy bruising\nmuscle weakness\n\nCorticosteroids can also be given by injection to provide rapid pain relief. This can be either into a muscle, a vein or directly into the affected joint.\u00a0\nMedication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks\nYou can reduce your chances of having further gout attacks by taking medication and making lifestyle changes to\u00a0reduce the level of\u00a0uric acid in your body.\nMedication to reduce uric acid levels\u00a0\u2013 known as urate-lowering therapy (ULT)\u00a0\u2013 is usually recommended if you have recurrent attacks of gout or you have  complications of gout.\nMost people with gout will eventually need to have ULT, so you may want to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this treatment with your doctor as soon as you've been diagnosed with gout.\nThey should explain that while ULT can significantly reduce your risk of having further attacks, the medication needs to be taken on a daily basis for the rest of your life and there's a small risk of side effects.\nIf you decide to start ULT, a medicine called allopurinol is usually tried first. If this isn't suitable or doesn't work, other medications may be used instead. These medications are described below.\nAllopurinol\u00a0helps reduce the production of uric acid. It can help prevent gout attacks, although it won't help relieve symptoms during an attack.\nAllopurinol is a tablet\u00a0taken once a day.\u00a0When you first start taking it, your dose will be adjusted to make sure the level of uric acid in your blood is low enough. Regular\u00a0blood tests will be needed to monitor this until the\u00a0most effective dose is found.\nAllopurinol can sometimes cause a gout attack soon after you start taking it and it\u00a0can take up to a year or two before no further attacks occur. It's important to persevere with treatment even if you do have attacks during this time.\nTo help\u00a0relieve attacks, your doctor will prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described above to take alongside your allopurinol at first.\nMost people taking allopurinol won't experience any significant side effects. However, side effects can include:\n\na rash \u2013 this is usually mild and goes away on its own, but it can be a sign of an\u00a0allergy; if you develop a rash, stop taking the medication immediately and contact your GP for advice\nindigestion\nheadaches\ndiarrhoea\n\nLike allopurinol, febuxostat\u00a0is a medication taken once a day that\u00a0reduces the body's production of uric acid. It's often used if allopurinol isn't suitable or causes troublesome side effects.\nAs with allopurinol, febuxostat can make your symptoms worse when you first start taking it. Your doctor will initially prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described in case you experience attacks.\nSide effects of febuxostat can include:\n\ndiarrhoea\nfeeling sick\nheadaches\na\u00a0rash\n\nLess commonly used ULT medications include benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone.\nThese types of medication tend to only be used if people are unable to take allopurinol or febuxostat. They need to be prescribed under the supervision of a specialist.\nCertain lifestyle changes can also help reduce your risk of experiencing further attacks of gout, including:\n\navoiding foods containing high levels of purine (the chemical involved in the production of uric acid), such as red meat, offal, oily fish, seafood and foods containing yeast extract.\navoiding sugary drinks and snacks \u2013 these are associated with an increased risk of gout\nmaintaining a healthy weight \u2013\u00a0follow a balanced diet; don't crash diet or try\u00a0high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets\ntaking regular exercise \u2013 try activities that don't put too much strain on your joints, such as swimming\ndrinking plenty of water \u2013\u00a0keeping yourself well hydrated will reduce the risk of crystals forming in your joints\ncutting down on alcohol \u2013 avoid beer and spirits in particular and don't binge drink\n\nThere's some evidence to suggest that taking regular\u00a0vitamin C supplements can reduce gout attacks, although the effect\u00a0may only be small. Talk to your GP first if you're thinking about taking vitamin C supplements, as they aren't suitable or safe for everyone.\n\n\nComplications of gout can include small lumps forming under the skin (tophi), joint damage and kidney stones. These are more likely to occur if gout is left untreated.\nTophi\nGout is caused by a chemical called uric acid forming small crystals in and around the joints. These crystals also often\u00a0build up\u00a0under the skin and form small white or yellow lumps known as tophi.\nTophi are usually painless, but they can form in awkward places, such as at the ends of your fingers and around your toes.\u00a0Sometimes they can make\u00a0everyday tasks such as preparing food or getting dressed difficult.\nThey can also\u00a0can become inflamed and produce a toothpaste-like discharge.\nTophi can develop anywhere in the body, but usually form on the:\n\ntoes\nheels\nknees\nfingers\nears\nforearms\nelbows\n\nIt normally takes several years after the first attack of gout for tophi to develop, but some people develop them even before experiencing an attack. They're usually a sign of severe gout and a good reason to start treatment to reduce the level or uric acid in your body.\nSuccessful treatment will prevent the tophi from getting any bigger, and long term treatment often gradually shrinks them.\nIf you have very large or painful tophi, they may have to be surgically removed.\nJoint damage\nWithout treatment, gout attacks may become more frequent and prolonged, and your likelihood of developing permanent joint damage will increase.\nIn the most serious cases, surgery may be required to repair or replace a damaged joint.\nKidney stones\nOccasionally, high levels of uric acid can\u00a0lead to the formation of kidney stones.\nSome kidney stones interfere with the flow of urine, resulting in pain when you pass urine, and can make you feel that you need to pass urine more often.\nSome kidney stones interfere with the flow of urine, resulting in pain when you pee, and can make you feel that you need to pee more often.\nYou may be prescribed medication to make your urine less acidic, which should help dissolve any kidney stones that have developed. Read more about treating kidney stones.\nPsychological and emotional\u00a0effects\nGout can also affect your mood, work and home life. The severe pain that gout causes can make it difficult to do everyday tasks and to get around, which in turn can lead to feelings of\u00a0depression or\u00a0anxiety.\nIf gout is affecting your mood or making everyday life difficult, talk to your GP. They will be able to offer treatment and support.\nThere are also a number of organisations that offer information and advice for people who have gout, including\u00a0Arthritis Research UK and Arthritis Care.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Gum disease is a very common condition where the gums become swollen, sore or infected.\nMost adults in the\u00a0UK have gum disease to some degree and\u00a0most people experience it at least once. It's much less common in children.\nIf you have gum disease, your\u00a0gums may bleed when\u00a0you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis.\nIf gingivitis isn't treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and\u00a0hold them in place.\nIf\u00a0periodontitis\u00a0isn't treated, the bone in your jaw\u00a0may be damaged and small spaces can open up\u00a0between the gum and teeth.\u00a0Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out.\nRead more about the symptoms of gum disease.\nWhat causes gum disease?\nGum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria.\nSome bacteria in plaque\u00a0are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. If you don't remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it\u00a0builds up and irritates your gums. This can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness.\nRead more about the causes of gum disease.\nSeeing your dentist\nYou should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful,\u00a0swollen\u00a0or if they bleed when you brush your teeth. Find a dentist near you.\nYour dentist\u00a0can carry out a thorough dental examination to check the health of your gums, which may involve inserting a thin\u00a0metal stick with a bend in one end\u00a0(periodontal probe) beside your teeth.\nIn some cases, a number of X-rays may be needed to check the condition of your teeth and jaw bone.\nPreventing and treating gum disease\nMild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups.\nIn most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They'll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future.\nIf you have severe gum disease, you'll\u00a0usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery may need to be carried out.\u00a0This will usually be performed by a specialist in gum\u00a0problems (periodontics).\nRead more about treating gum disease and keeping your teeth clean.\nDental check-ups\nIt's important\u00a0to have regular dental\u00a0check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early.\nIf you've never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every one to two\u00a0years for a check-up.\nYou may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you've had problems with gum disease in the past. At each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment.\nIf you have an increased risk of developing gum problems\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you smoke or have diabetes\u00a0\u2013 you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored.\nComplications of gum disease\nIf you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as:\n\ngum abscesses\u00a0(painful collections of pus)\nreceding gums\nloose teeth\nloss of teeth\n\nRead more about the complications of gum disease.\n\n\nHealthy gums should be pink, firm and keep your teeth securely in place. Your gums shouldn't bleed when you touch or brush them.\nGum disease isn't always\u00a0painful and you may be unaware you have it. It's important to have regular dental check-ups.\nEarly symptoms\nThe initial symptoms of gum disease can include:\n\nred and swollen\u00a0gums\nbleeding gums after brushing or flossing your teeth\n\nThis stage of gum disease is called gingivitis.\nAdvanced symptoms\nIf\u00a0gingivitis is untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected. This is known as\u00a0periodontitis, or periodontal disease.\nSymptoms of periodontitis can include:\n\nbad breath (halitosis)\nan\u00a0unpleasant\u00a0taste in your mouth\nloose teeth that can make eating difficult\ngum abscesses\u00a0(collections of pus that\u00a0develop under your gums or\u00a0teeth)\n\nAcute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis\nIn rare cases, a condition called\u00a0acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) can develop suddenly. The symptoms of ANUG are usually more severe than those of gum disease and can include:\n\nbleeding, painful gums\npainful ulcers\nreceding gums inbetween your teeth\nbad breath\na metallic taste in your mouth\nexcess saliva in your mouth\ndifficulty swallowing or talking\na high temperature (fever)\n\nWhen to see a dentist\nYou should make an appointment to see your dentist if you think you may have gum disease or ANUG.\nIf you don't currently have a dentist, search for a dentist near you.\nRead more about treating gum disease.\n\n\nGum disease can be caused by a number of factors, but poor oral hygiene is the most common cause.\nPoor oral hygiene, such as not brushing your teeth properly or regularly, can cause plaque\u00a0to build up on your teeth.\nPlaque\nYour mouth is full of bacteria that\u00a0combine with saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque, which\u00a0builds up on your teeth.\nWhen you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates (sugary or starchy foods), bacteria in plaque turn carbohydrates into the energy they need, producing acid at the same time.\nOver time, acid in plaque begins to break down your tooth's surface and causes tooth decay.\nOther bacteria in plaque\u00a0can also\u00a0irritate your gums, making them inflamed and sore.\nPlaque is usually easy to remove by brushing\u00a0and flossing\u00a0your teeth, but it can harden and form a substance called\u00a0tartar\u00a0if it's not removed.\u00a0Tartar sticks much more firmly to teeth than plaque and can usually only be removed by a dentist or dental hygienist.\nWho is most at risk?\nAs well as poor oral hygiene,\u00a0a number of things can increase your risk of developing problems with your gums. These include:\n\nsmoking\u00a0\nyour age\u00a0\u2013 gum disease\u00a0becomes more common as you get older\na family history of gum disease\ndiabetes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar levels to become too high\na weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 for example,\u00a0because of\u00a0conditions such as HIV and AIDS or\u00a0certain treatments, such as chemotherapy\nmalnutrition\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that occurs when a person's diet does not contain the right amount of nutrients\nstress\n\n\n\nThe best way to treat gum disease is to practise good oral hygiene, although additional dental and medical treatments are sometimes necessary.\nOral hygiene\nGood oral hygiene involves:\n\nbrushing your teeth for about two minutes last thing at night before you go to bed and on one other occasion everyday\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it doesn't matter if you use an electric or manual toothbrush but some people find it easier to clean their teeth thoroughly with an electric toothbrush\nusing toothpaste that contains\u00a0the right amount of fluoride (a natural mineral that helps protect against tooth decay)\nflossing\u00a0your teeth regularly\u00a0\u2013\u00a0preferably daily, before brushing your teeth\nnot smoking\nregularly visiting your dentist \u2013 at least once every one to two\u00a0years, but more frequently if necessary\n\nSee the teeth cleaning guide\u00a0for more information and advice about how to keep your teeth clean.\nAntiseptic mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine or hexetidine are available over the counter from pharmacies. However,\u00a0there's some debate about whether using\u00a0mouthwash is\u00a0necessary for people with healthy gums.\nYour dentist may recommend using mouthwash if it helps control the build-up of plaque (the sticky substance that forms when bacteria collects on the surface of your teeth). Your dentist will be able to advise\u00a0you about which type of mouthwash is most suitable and how to use it.\nChlorhexidine mouthwash can stain your teeth brown if you use it\u00a0regularly. Rinse your mouth thoroughly between brushing your teeth and using a chlorhexidine mouthwash because some ingredients in toothpaste can prevent the mouthwash working.\u00a0\u00a0\nDental treatments\nSome of the dental treatments described below may also be recommended if you have gum disease.\nTo remove plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) that can build up on your teeth, your dentist may suggest that you have your teeth scaled and polished. This is a \"professional clean\" usually carried out at your dental surgery by a dental hygienist.\nThe dental hygienist will scrape away plaque and tartar from your teeth using special instruments, then polish your teeth to remove marks or stains. If a lot of plaque or tartar has built up, you may need to have more than one scale and polish.\nThe price of a scale and polish can vary depending on what needs to be carried out, so ask your dental hygienist how much it will cost beforehand.\n\u00a0\nIn some cases of gum disease, root planing (debridement) may be required. This is a deep clean under the gums that gets rid of bacteria from the roots of your teeth.\nBefore having the treatment, you may need to have a\u00a0local anaesthetic (painkilling medication) to numb the area. You may experience some pain and discomfort for up to 48 hours after having root planing.\nIf you have severe gum disease, you may need further treatment, such as periodontal surgery. In some cases, it's necessary to remove the affected tooth. Your dentist will be able to tell you about the procedure needed and how it's carried out. If necessary, they can refer you to a specialist.\nIf you're having surgery or root planing, you may be given antibiotics (medication to treat infections). Your dentist will tell you whether this is necessary.\nAcute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis\nAcute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) should always be treated by a dentist. However, if you see your GP before visiting a dentist, they may provide you with some treatment while you wait to see your dentist.\nAs well as the oral hygiene advice and dental treatments mentioned above, treatments for ANUG may also include antibiotics, painkillers and\u00a0different types of mouthwash. These are described below.\nTreatment with\u00a0antibiotics, such as metronidazole or amoxicillin, may be recommended if you have ANUG.\u00a0You'll usually have to take these for three days.\nAmoxicillin isn't suitable for people allergic to penicillin. Metronidazole can react with alcohol, causing you to feel very unwell. You shouldn't drink alcohol while you're taking metronidazole and for 48 hours after you finish the course of treatment.\nOther side effects of metronidazole and amoxicillin can include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting and diarrhoea.\nParacetamol\u00a0and\u00a0ibuprofen are the most commonly prescribed painkillers.\u00a0They're also available over the counter from pharmacies. They may help reduce pain and discomfort.\nHowever, paracetamol and ibuprofen aren't suitable for everyone, so read the manufacturer's instructions before taking them.\nMouthwash containing chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide may be prescribed to treat ANUG. Some chlorhexidine mouthwashes are also available over the counter, though they may not be as effective as a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash.\nYou should always read the instructions before using mouthwash. Some types may need to be diluted in water before they're taken.\n\n\nIf you develop gingivitis and don't have the plaque or tartar (hardened plaque) removed from your teeth, the condition may get worse and lead to periodontitis.\nYou may develop further complications\u00a0if you don't treat periodontitis (where the tissue that supports teeth is affected),\u00a0including:\n\nrecurrent\u00a0gum abscesses (painful collections of pus)\nincreasing damage to the periodontal ligament\u00a0(the tissue that connects the tooth to the socket)\nincreasing damage to and loss of the alveolar bone (the bone in the jaw that contains the sockets of the teeth)\nreceding gums\nloose teeth\nloss of teeth\n\nAcute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis\nIf you have acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) and it's\u00a0not treated, it can cause more severe complications.\nThe infection can spread to all areas of your gums and the alveolar bone surrounding your teeth. This can lead to:\n\nthe gums between your teeth being completely destroyed\nlarge ulcers (open sores) leaving permanent holes in your gums\nloose and unstable teeth\n\nIf ANUG isn't properly treated the first time you have it, you're more likely to have recurring cases in\u00a0the future. This can cause persistent bad breath (halitosis) and bleeding gums, as well as gradually receding gums.\nIn rare cases, ANUG can lead to gangrene affecting the lips and cheeks. This occurs when tissue starts to die and waste away. If you develop\u00a0gangrene, you may need\u00a0to have the dead tissue removed.\nOther complications\nGum disease has also been associated with an increased risk\u00a0for\u00a0a number of other health conditions, including:\n\ncardiovascular disease\nlung infections\nif affected during pregnancy, premature labour and having a baby with a low birth weight\n\nHowever, while people with gum disease may have an increased risk of these problems, there isn't currently any clear evidence that gum disease directly causes them.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Haemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swellings containing enlarged blood vessels that are found inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus).\nIn many cases,\u00a0haemorrhoids don't cause symptoms, and some people\u00a0don't even realise they have them. However, when symptoms do occur, they may include:\n\nbleeding after passing a stool (the blood is usually bright red)\nitchy bottom\na lump hanging down outside of the anus, which may need to be pushed back in after passing a stool\na mucus discharge after passing a stool\nsoreness, redness and swelling around your anus\n\nHaemorrhoids aren't usually painful, unless their blood supply slows down or is interrupted.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee your GP if\u00a0you have persistent or severe symptoms of haemorrhoids. You should always get any rectal bleeding checked out, so your doctor can rule out more potentially serious causes.\nThe symptoms of haemorrhoids often clear up on their own or with simple treatments that can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription\u00a0(see below). However, speak to your GP if your symptoms don't get better or if you experience pain or bleeding.\nYour GP can often diagnose haemorrhoids using a simple internal examination of your back passage, although they may need to refer you to a colorectal specialist for diagnosis and treatment.\nSome people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there\u2019s no need to be embarrassed, because GPs are very used to diagnosing and treating haemorrhoids.\nRead more about diagnosing haemorrhoids.\nWhat causes\u00a0haemorrhoids?\nThe exact cause of haemorrhoids is unclear, but\u00a0they're associated with increased pressure in the\u00a0blood vessels in and around your anus. This pressure can cause the blood vessels in your back passage to become swollen and inflamed.\nMany cases are thought to be caused by too much straining on the toilet, due to prolonged constipation \u2013 this is often due to a lack of\u00a0fibre in a person's diet. Chronic (long-term)\u00a0diarrhoea can also make you more vulnerable to getting haemorrhoids.\nOther factors that might increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids include:\n\nbeing overweight or obese\nage\u00a0\u2013 as you get older, your body's supporting tissues get weaker, increasing your risk of haemorrhoids\nbeing\u00a0pregnant\u00a0\u2013 which can place increased pressure on your pelvic blood vessels, causing them to enlarge (read more about common pregnancy problems)\nhaving a family history of haemorrhoids\nregularly lifting heavy objects\na\u00a0persistent\u00a0cough or repeated vomiting\nsitting down for long periods of time\n\nPreventing and treating haemorrhoids\u00a0\nHaemorrhoid symptoms often\u00a0settle down after\u00a0a few days, without needing treatment. Haemorrhoids that occur during pregnancy often get better after giving birth.\nHowever, making lifestyle changes to reduce the strain on\u00a0the blood vessels in and around your anus is often recommended. These can include:\n\ngradually\u00a0increasing the amount of fibre in your diet \u2013 good sources of fibre include fruit, vegetables, wholegrain rice, wholewheat pasta and bread, pulses and beans, seeds, nuts and oats\ndrinking plenty of fluid\u00a0\u2013 particularly water,\u00a0but avoiding or\u00a0cutting down on caffeine and alcohol\nnot delaying going to the toilet \u2013 ignoring the urge to empty your bowels can make your stools harder and drier, which can lead to straining when you do go to the toilet\navoiding medication that causes constipation \u2013 such as painkillers that contain codeine\nlosing weight (if you're overweight)\nexercising regularly \u2013 can help prevent constipation, reduce your blood pressure and help you lose weight\n\nThese measures can also reduce\u00a0the risk of haemorrhoids returning, or even developing\u00a0in the first place.\nMedication that you apply directly to your back passage (known as topical treatments) or tablets bought from a pharmacy or prescribed by your GP may ease your symptoms and make it easier for you to pass stools.\nThere are various treatment options for more severe haemorrhoids. One of these options is banding, which is a non-surgical procedure where a very tight elastic band is put around the base of the haemorrhoid to cut off\u00a0its blood supply. The haemorrhoid should fall off\u00a0after about a week.\nSurgery carried out under\u00a0general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) is sometimes\u00a0used to\u00a0remove or shrink\u00a0large or external haemorrhoids.\nRead more about\u00a0treating haemorrhoids\u00a0and surgery for haemorrhoids.\n\n\nYour GP can diagnose haemorrhoids (piles) by examining your back passage to check for swollen blood vessels.\nSome people with haemorrhoids are reluctant to see their GP. However, there\u2019s no need to be embarrassed \u2013 all GPs are used to diagnosing and treating piles.\nIt's important to tell your GP about all of your symptoms \u2013 for example, tell them if you've recently lost a lot of weight, if your bowel movements have changed, or if your\u00a0stools have become dark or sticky.\nRectal examination\nYour GP may examine the outside of your anus to see if you have visible haemorrhoids, and they may also carry out an internal examination called a\u00a0digital rectal examination (DRE).\nDuring a DRE, your GP will wear gloves and use lubricant. Using their finger, they'll\u00a0feel for any abnormalities in your back passage. A DRE shouldn't be painful, but you may feel some slight discomfort.\nProctoscopy\nIn some cases, further internal examination using a proctoscope may be needed. A proctoscope is a thin hollow tube with a light on the end that's inserted into your anus.\nThis allows\u00a0your doctor to see your entire anal canal (the last section of the large intestine).\nGPs are sometimes able to carry out a proctoscopy. However, not all GPs have the correct training or access to the right equipment, so you may need to\u00a0go to a\u00a0hospital clinic\u00a0to have the procedure.\nTypes of haemorrhoids\nAfter you've had a rectal examination or proctoscopy, your doctor will be able to\u00a0determine what type of haemorrhoids you have.\nHaemorrhoids can develop internally or externally. Internal haemorrhoids develop in the upper two-thirds of your anal canal and external haemorrhoids in the lower third (closest to your anus). The nerves in the\u00a0lower part can transmit pain messages, while the nerves\u00a0in the upper part\u00a0can't.\nHaemorrhoids can be further classified, depending on their size and severity. They can be:\n\nfirst degree \u2013 small swellings that develop on the inside lining of the anus and aren't visible from outside the anus\nsecond degree \u2013 larger swellings that may come out of your anus when you go to the toilet, before disappearing inside again\nthird degree \u2013 one or more small soft lumps that hang down from the anus and can be pushed back inside\u00a0(prolapsing and reducible)\nfourth degree \u2013 larger lumps that hang down from the anus and can't be pushed back inside\u00a0(irreducible)\n\nIt's useful for doctors to know what type\u00a0and size of haemorrhoid you have, as they can then decide on the best treatment.\nRead more about treating haemorrhoids.\n\n\nHaemorrhoids (piles) often clear up by themselves after a few days. However, there are many treatments that can reduce itching and discomfort.\nMaking simple dietary changes and not straining on the toilet are often recommended first.\nCreams, ointments and suppositories\u00a0(which you\u00a0insert into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and\u00a0discomfort.\nIf more intensive treatment is needed, the type will depend on where your haemorrhoids are in your anal canal \u2013 the lower third (closest to your anus)\u00a0or the upper two-thirds. The lower third contain nerves which can transmit pain, while the upper two-thirds do not.\nNon-surgical treatments for haemorrhoids\u00a0in the lower part of the canal\u00a0are likely to be very painful, because the nerves in this area can detect pain. In these cases,\u00a0haemorrhoid surgery\u00a0will usually be recommended.\nThe various treatments for\u00a0haemorrhoids are outlined below.\u00a0\nDietary changes and self care\nIf\u00a0constipation\u00a0is thought to be the cause of\u00a0your haemorrhoids, you need to\u00a0keep your stools soft and regular, so that you don't strain when passing stools.\nYou can do this by increasing the amount of fibre in your diet. Good sources of fibre include wholegrain bread, cereal, fruit and vegetables.\nYou should also\u00a0drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine (found in tea, coffee and cola).\nWhen going to the toilet, you should:\n\navoid straining to pass stools, because it may make your haemorrhoids worse\nuse\u00a0moist toilet paper,\u00a0rather than dry toilet paper, or baby wipes\u00a0to clean your bottom\u00a0after passing a stool\npat the area\u00a0around your bottom, rather than rubbing it\n\nRead more about preventing constipation.\nMedication\nVarious creams, ointments and suppositories\u00a0(which are inserted into your bottom) are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They can be used to relieve any swelling and\u00a0discomfort.\nThese medicines\u00a0should only be used for five to seven days at a time. If you use them\u00a0for longer, they may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus.\u00a0Any medication should be combined with the diet and self-care advice discussed above.\nThere's no evidence to suggest that one method is more effective than another. Ask your pharmacist for advice about which product is most suitable for you, and always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine before using it.\nDon't use more than one product at once.\nIf you have severe inflammation in and around your back passage, your GP\u00a0may prescribe corticosteroid cream, which\u00a0contains steroids.\nYou shouldn't use corticosteroid cream for more than a week at a time, because it can make the skin around your anus thinner and the irritation worse.\nCommon painkilling medication, such as paracetamol, can help relieve the pain of haemorrhoids.\nHowever, if you have excessive bleeding, avoid using non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, because it can make rectal bleeding worse. You should also avoid using codeine painkillers, because they can cause constipation.\nYour GP may prescribe products that contain\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0to treat painful haemorrhoids. Like over-the-counter topical treatments, these should only be used for a few days, because they can make the skin around\u00a0your back passage more sensitive.\nIf you're constipated, your GP may prescribe a laxative. Laxatives are a type of medicine that can help you empty your bowels.\nNon-surgical treatments\nIf dietary changes and medication don't improve your symptoms,\u00a0your GP may refer you to a specialist. They can confirm whether you have haemorrhoids and recommend appropriate treatment.\nIf you have haemorrhoids in the upper part of your anal canal, non-surgical procedures such as banding and sclerotherapy may be recommended.\nBanding\u00a0involves placing\u00a0a very tight elastic band around the base of your haemorrhoids to cut off their\u00a0blood supply. The haemorrhoids should then fall off\u00a0within about a week of having the treatment.\nBanding is usually a day procedure that doesn't need an\u00a0anaesthetic, and most people can get back to their normal activities the next day. You may feel some pain or discomfort for a day or so afterwards. Normal painkillers are usually adequate, but your GP can prescribe something stronger, if needed.\nYou may not realise that your haemorrhoids have fallen off, as they should pass out of your body when you go to the toilet. If\u00a0you notice some mucus discharge within a week of the procedure, it\u00a0usually means that the haemorrhoids have fallen off.\nDirectly after the procedure, you may notice blood on the toilet paper after going to the toilet.\u00a0This is normal, but there shouldn't be a lot of bleeding. If you pass a lot of bright red blood or\u00a0blood clots (solid lumps of blood), go to\u00a0your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately.\nUlcers (open sores) can occur at the site of the banding, although these usually heal without needing further treatment.\nA treatment called sclerotherapy may be used as an alternative to banding.\nDuring sclerotherapy,\u00a0a\u00a0chemical solution is injected into the blood vessels in your back passage. This relieves pain by numbing the nerve endings at the site of the injection. It also hardens the tissue of the haemorrhoid so that a scar is formed. After about 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks, the haemorrhoid should decrease in size or shrivel up.\nAfter the injection, you should avoid strenuous exercise for the rest of the day.\u00a0You may experience minor pain for a while and may bleed a little. You should be able to resume normal activities, including work, the day after the procedure.\nElectrotherapy, also known as electrocoagulation, is another\u00a0alternative to banding\u00a0for people with\u00a0smaller\u00a0haemorrhoids.\nDuring the procedure, a\u00a0device called a proctoscope is inserted into the anus to locate\u00a0the haemorrhoid.\u00a0An electric current is then passed through a small metal probe that's placed at the base of the haemorrhoid, above the dentate line. The specialist\u00a0can control the electric current using controls attached to the probe.\nThe aim of electrotherapy\u00a0is to cause the blood supplying the haemorrhoid to coagulate (thicken), which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink. If necessary, more than one haemorrhoid can be treated during each session.\nElectrotherapy\u00a0can either be carried out on outpatient basis using a low electric current, or a higher dose can be given while the person is under a\u00a0general anaesthetic or spinal anaesthetic.\nYou may experience some mild pain during or after electrotherapy, but in most cases this doesn't last long.\u00a0Rectal bleeding is another possible\u00a0side effect of the procedure, but this is usually\u00a0short-lived.\u00a0\u00a0\nElectrotherapy\u00a0is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and has been shown to be an effective method of treating smaller haemorrhoids. It can also be used\u00a0as an alternative to surgery for\u00a0treating larger haemorrhoids, but there's less evidence of its effectiveness.\nSurgery\nAlthough most haemorrhoids can be treated using the methods described above, around 1 in every 10 people will eventually need surgery.\nSurgery is particularly useful for haemorrhoids that have developed below the dentate line because, unlike non-surgical treatments, anaesthetic is used to ensure you don\u2019t feel any pain.\nThere are many different types of surgery that can be used to treat haemorrhoids, but they all usually involve either removing the haemorrhoids or reducing their blood supply, causing them to shrink.\nRead more about surgery for haemorrhoids.\n\n\nSurgery may be recommended if other treatments for haemorrhoids (piles) haven't worked, or if you have haemorrhoids that aren't suitable for non-surgical treatment.\nThere are many different surgical procedures for piles. The main types of operation are described below.\nHaemorrhoidectomy\nA haemorrhoidectomy is an operation to remove haemorrhoids. It's usually carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious during the procedure and won't feel any pain while it's carried out.\nA conventional haemorrhoidectomy involves gently opening the anus so the haemorrhoids can be cut out. You'll need to take a week or so off work to recover.\nYou'll probably experience significant pain after the operation, but you will be given painkillers. You may still have pain a few weeks after the procedure, which can also be controlled with painkillers. Seek medical advice if you have pain that continues for longer.\nAfter having a haemorrhoidectomy, there's around a 1 in 20 chance of the haemorrhoids returning, which is lower than with non-surgical treatments. Adopting or continuing a high-fibre diet after surgery is recommended to reduce this risk.\nHaemorrhoidal artery ligation\nHaemorrhoidal artery ligation is an operation to reduce the blood flow to your haemorrhoids.\nIt's usually carried out under general anaesthetic and involves inserting a small\u00a0ultrasound probe into your anus. The probe produces high-frequency sound waves that allow the surgeon to locate the vessels supplying blood to the haemorrhoid.\nEach blood vessel is stitched closed to block the blood supply to the haemorrhoid, which causes the haemorrhoid to shrink over the following days and weeks. The stitches can also be used to reduce prolapsing haemorrhoids (haemorrhoids that hang down from the anus).\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends haemorrhoidal artery ligation as a safe and\u00a0effective alternative to a haemorrhoidectomy or stapled haemorrhoidopexy (see below). It causes less pain and, in terms of results, a high level of satisfaction has been reported.\nThe recovery time after having haemorrhoidal artery ligation is also quicker\u00a0compared with other surgical procedures. There's a low risk of bleeding, pain when passing stools, or the haemorrhoid becoming prolapsed after this procedure, but these usually improve within a few weeks.\nStapling\nStapling, also known as stapled haemorrhoidopexy, is an alternative to a conventional haemorrhoidectomy. It's sometimes used to treat prolapsed haemorrhoids and is carried out under general anaesthetic.\nThe procedure isn't carried out as often as it used to be, because it has a slightly higher risk of serious complications than the alternative treatments available.\nDuring the operation, part of the anorectum (the last section of the large intestine), is stapled. This means the haemorrhoids are less likely to prolapse and it reduces the supply of blood to the haemorrhoids, which causes them to gradually shrink.\nStapling has a shorter recovery time than a traditional haemorrhoidectomy, and you can probably return to work about a week afterwards. It also tends to be a less painful procedure.\nHowever, after stapling, more people experience another prolapsed haemorrhoid compared with having a haemorrhoidectomy. There have also been a very small number of serious complications following the stapling procedure, such as fistula to vagina in women (where a small channel develops between the anal canal and the vagina) or rectal perforation (where a hole develops in the rectum).\nOther treatments\nOther treatment options are available, including freezing and laser treatment. However, the number of NHS or private surgeons who perform these treatments is limited.\nGeneral risks of haemorrhoid surgery\nAlthough the risk of serious problems is small, complications can occasionally occur after haemorrhoid surgery. These can include:\n\nbleeding or passing\u00a0blood clots,\u00a0which\u00a0may happen a week or so after the operation\ninfection, which\u00a0may lead to a build-up of pus (known as an abscess)\u00a0\u2013 you may be given a short course of\u00a0antibiotics after surgery to reduce this risk\nurinary retention (difficulty emptying your bladder)\nfaecal incontinence\u00a0(the involuntarily passing of\u00a0stools)\u00a0\nanal fistula\u00a0(a small channel that develops between the anal canal and surface of the skin, near the anus)\nstenosis (narrowing of the anal canal) \u2013 this risk is highest if you have treatment on haemorrhoids that have developed in a ring around the lining of the anal canal\n\nThese problems can\u00a0often be treated with medication or more surgery. Ask your surgeon to explain the risks in more detail before deciding to have surgery.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSeek medical advice from the hospital unit where the surgery was carried out, or from your GP, if you experience:\n\nexcessive bleeding\na high temperature (fever)\nproblems urinating\nworsening pain or swelling around your anus\n\nIf you're unable to contact the hospital or your GP, call\u00a0NHS 24 111 service for advice or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Hearing loss is a common problem that often develops with age or is caused by repeated exposure to loud noises.\nAction on Hearing Loss estimates that there are more than 10 million (about 1 in 6) people in the UK\u00a0with some degree of hearing impairment\u00a0or deafness.\nHearing loss can occur suddenly, but usually develops gradually.

Being aware of the early signs can help you identify the problem quickly.\nIt's important to spot hearing loss\u00a0as soon as possible, because treatment is often more beneficial if started early.\nGeneral signs of hearing loss\nEarly signs of hearing loss can include:\n\ndifficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations\nasking\u00a0people to repeat themselves\nlistening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need\ndifficulty hearing the telephone or doorbell\nfinding it difficult to tell which direction noise is coming from\nregularly feeling tired or stressed,\u00a0from having to concentrate while listening\n\nIn some cases, you may\u00a0recognise signs of hearing loss in someone else before they\u00a0notice it themselves.\u00a0Research suggests it takes 10 years from the time someone notices they have hearing loss, before they do anything about it.\nIf you also hear a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound in your ears, this could be a sign of tinnitus, which is often associated with hearing loss.\nRead more about losing your hearing\nSigns of hearing\u00a0loss in children\nBabies are routinely screened within the first few weeks of their birth as part of the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP).

There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies.\n\nSensorineural hearing loss is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the inner ear or damage to the auditory nerve. This occurs naturally with age or as a result of injury.\nConductive hearing loss\u00a0happens when sounds are unable to pass from your outer ear to your inner ear, often because of a blockage such as earwax or\u00a0glue ear.\n\nThese causes are explained below.\nAge\nAge is the biggest single cause of\u00a0hearing loss. Hearing loss that develops as a result of getting older is often known as age-related hearing loss or presbycusis.\nMost people begin to lose a small amount of their hearing\u00a0from around\u00a040 years\u00a0of age. This hearing loss increases as you get older. By the age of 80, most people have significant hearing problems.\nAs your hearing starts to deteriorate, high-frequency sounds, such as female or children\u2019s voices, may become difficult to hear. It may also be harder to hear consonants such as \"s\", \"f\" and \"th\". This can make understanding speech in background noise very difficult.\nLoud noises\nAnother common cause of hearing loss is damage to the ear from repeated exposure to loud noises over time. This is known as noise-induced hearing loss, and it occurs when the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea become damaged.\nYou're at higher risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss if you:\n\nwork with noisy equipment, such as pneumatic drills or compressed-air hammers\nwork in environments where there's loud music, such as a nightclub\nregularly listen to music at a high volume through headphones\n\nHearing loss can also occur suddenly\u00a0after exposure to\u00a0an exceptionally loud noise, such as an explosion. This is known as acoustic trauma.\nSee\u00a0preventing hearing loss\u00a0for advice on reducing your risk of noise-induced hearing loss.\nOther types of sensorineural hearing\u00a0loss\nSensorineural hearing loss occurs if the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea are damaged, or as a result of damage to the auditory nerve (which transmits sound to the brain). In some cases, both may be damaged.\nHearing loss caused by age and exposure to loud noises are both types of sensorineural hearing loss.\nSensorineural hearing loss can\u00a0also\u00a0be caused by:\n\nthe genes you inherit \u2013\u00a0some people may be\u00a0born deaf or become deaf over time\u00a0because of\u00a0a genetic abnormality\nviral infections of the inner ear \u2013\u00a0such as mumps or\u00a0measles\nviral infections of the auditory nerve \u2013\u00a0such as mumps or rubella\nacoustic neuroma\u00a0\u2013 a non-cancerous (benign) growth on or near the auditory nerve\nmeningitis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord\nencephalitis\u00a0\u2013 inflammation\u00a0of the brain\nmultiple sclerosis\u00a0\u2013 a neurological condition affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)\na head injury\nan autoimmune condition\nmalformation of the ear\nstroke\u00a0\u2013 where the blood supply to the brain is cut off or interrupted\n\nSome\u00a0treatments and medicines, such as radiotherapy\u00a0for nasal and sinus cancer, certain chemotherapy\u00a0medicines or certain\u00a0antibiotics can also damage the cochlea and the auditory nerve, causing sensorineural hearing loss.\nPeople with diabetes,\u00a0chronic kidney disease and\u00a0cardiovascular disease are also at increased risk of hearing loss.\nSensorineural hearing loss is permanent and hearing aids are often required to improve hearing in these cases.\u00a0\nCauses of conductive hearing loss\nConductive hearing loss is usually caused by a blockage, such as having too much ear wax, a build-up of fluid in the ear\u00a0(glue ear), or an ear infection.\nConductive hearing loss can also be caused by:\n\na perforated eardrum\u00a0\u2013 where the eardrum is torn or has a hole in it\notosclerosis\u00a0\u2013 an abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear that causes the inner hearing bone (the stapes) to be less mobile and less effective at transmitting sound\ndamage to the hearing bones from injury, a collapsed ear drum or conditions such as\u00a0cholesteatoma\nswelling around the eustachian tube\u00a0\u2013\u00a0caused by jaw surgery or radiotherapy for nasal and sinus cancer\nmalformation of the ear\nEustachian tube dysfunction\nsomething becoming trapped in the ear (a foreign body)\n\nConductive hearing loss is usually temporary and can often be treated with medication or minor surgery.\nRead more about treating hearing loss\n\n\nSee your GP if you're having problems with your hearing. They'll examine your ears and carry out some simple hearing tests.\nYou may also want to visit the\u00a0Action on Hearing Loss website for an online hearing test.\nEar examination\nDuring an ear examination, an instrument with a light at the end called an auriscope (or otoscope) is used to look for anything abnormal, including:\n\na blockage caused by\u00a0earwax, fluid or an object\nan ear canal infection\na bulging ear drum\u00a0\u2013 indicating\u00a0an\u00a0infection inside the\u00a0middle ear\nfluid behind the ear drum\u00a0\u2013\u00a0known as glue ear\na perforated ear drum\u00a0\na collapsed ear drum\nskin collected in the middle ear (cholesteatoma)\n\nYour GP will ask\u00a0if you have any pain in your ear and when you first noticed the hearing loss.\nReferral to a specialist\nYour GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiologist (a hearing specialist). The specialist will carry out further hearing tests to help determine what's causing your hearing loss and recommend the best course of treatment.\nSome of the hearing tests you may have include a:\n\ntuning fork test (sometimes performed by your GP)\npure tone audiometry\nbone conduction test\n\nThese tests are described below.\nA tuning fork is a Y-shaped, metallic object. It produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it's gently tapped and can be used to test different aspects of your hearing.\nThe tester taps the tuning fork on their elbow or knee to make it vibrate, before holding it at different places around your head.\nThis test can help determine if you have conductive hearing loss, which is hearing loss caused by sounds not being able to pass freely into the inner ear, or sensorineural hearing loss, where the inner ear or hearing nerve isn't working properly.\nPure tone audiometry\u00a0tests the hearing of both ears. During the test, a machine called an audiometer produces sounds at various volumes and frequencies (pitches). You listen to the sounds through headphones and respond when you hear them, usually by pressing a button.\nA bone conduction test is often carried out as part of a routine pure tone audiometry test in adults. It's used to check if you have sensorineural hearing loss, by testing how well your inner ear is working.\nBone conduction involves placing a vibrating probe against the mastoid bone behind the ear. It tests how well sounds transmitted through the bone are heard.\nBone conduction is a more sophisticated version of the tuning fork test, and when used together with pure tone audiometry, it can help to determine whether hearing loss comes from the outer and middle ear (conductive hearing loss), the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), or both.\nRead about how hearing tests are performed\nNewborn hearing screening\nAll newborn babies are offered a hearing test in the first few weeks after birth as part of the\u00a0NHS\u00a0Newborn Hearing Screening Programme.\nThe tests helps to identify babies who have permanent hearing loss as soon as possible so that parents can get the support and advice they need.\nRead more about the newborn hearing test\nLevels of hearing loss\nVery few people with hearing loss hear nothing at all. There are four different levels of hearing loss, which are defined by the quietest sound you're able to hear, measured in decibels (dB). These are described below.\nIf you're mildly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 21 to 40dB. Mild deafness can sometimes make\u00a0hearing speech difficult, particularly in noisy situations.\nIf you're moderately deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 41 to 70dB. You may have difficulty following speech without using a hearing aid\u00a0and may find it difficult to hear announcements, for example.\nIf you're severely deaf, the quietest sound you're able to hear is 71 to 90dB. People who are severely deaf usually need to lip-read or use sign language, even with the use of a hearing aid.\nIf you're profoundly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is more than 90dB. People who are profoundly deaf\u00a0can benefit from a cochlear implant. Other forms of communication include lip reading and British sign language or signed English.\nRead more about\u00a0treating hearing impairment, including different types of hearing aids and sign language.\n\n\nHow hearing loss is treated depends on the underlying cause of the condition.\nHearing loss that occurs when sounds are unable to pass into the inner ear (conductive hearing loss) is often temporary and treatable.\nFor example,\u00a0earwax build-up can be removed by drops, a syringe or suction. Hearing loss caused by a bacterial infection can be treated with\u00a0antibiotics. Surgery can be used to drain a fluid build-up, repair\u00a0a\u00a0perforated eardrum, or correct problems with the hearing bones.\nHowever, hearing loss caused by\u00a0damage to the inner ear or to the\u00a0nerves that transmit sound to brain (sensorineural hearing loss) is permanent.\nIf your hearing is impaired,\u00a0treatment can improve your hearing and quality of life. Some of these treatments are discussed below.\nHearing aids\nIf you have\u00a0hearing problems, you may be able to wear a hearing aid.\u00a0About 1.4 million people regularly use hearing aids in the UK, and many more would benefit from them.\nA hearing aid is an electronic device that consists of a microphone, an amplifier, a loudspeaker\u00a0and a battery. It increases the volume of sound entering your ear, so you\u00a0can hear things more clearly.\nThe microphone picks up sound, which is made louder by the amplifier. Hearing aids are fitted with devices that can distinguish between background noise, such as traffic, and foreground noise, such as conversation.\nModern hearing aids are very small and discreet, and can often be worn inside your ear.\nHearing aids help improve hearing, but don't give you your hearing back. They're suitable for most people, but may be less effective for people with\u00a0profound hearing impairment or certain conditions. Your GP or audiologist (hearing specialist) can advise you about whether a hearing aid is suitable for you.\nIf a hearing aid is recommended, an audiologist\u00a0may take an impression of your ear so the hearing aid fits you perfectly or may show you an open fit hearing aid. The hearing aid will be adjusted to suit your level of hearing impairment. You'll also be shown how to use and care for it.\nAfter your hearing aid has been fitted, you should\u00a0have\u00a0a follow-up appointment\u00a0within 12 weeks.\nIf you experience problems using a hearing aid \u2013 such as distortion and repeated infections \u2013 that can't be corrected by an audiologist, you may benefit from different\u00a0treatments. An ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon can discuss these with you. An ENT surgeon with a special interest in ear surgery is called an otologist.\nThe NHS\u00a0loans\u00a0hearing aids to people with hearing loss free of charge. This\u00a0includes free repairs, batteries and servicing. Many areas now charge for lost hearing aids, but you'll be told about any costs at your fitting appointment.\nIn the UK, both analogue and digital hearing aids are commonly used. Most hearing aids prescribed through the NHS are now digital.\nInstead of having moving parts, digital hearing aids contain a very small computer that processes sounds. This enables the hearing aid to be programmed to suit different environments, such as a small, quiet room or a large, noisy workshop.\nThe type of digital hearing aids available through the NHS are usually the behind-the-ear (BTE) type (see below). Other types of hearing aid\u00a0may be\u00a0issued in cases where a medical condition prevents an individual from using BTE hearing aids. You can also choose to pay privately for another type of hearing aid if it's not available on the NHS.\nTypes of hearing aids\nThe\u00a0different types of hearing aids are described below.\nBTE hearing aids usually have an earmould, which sits inside your ear. The rest of the hearing aid is connected to the earmould and lies behind your ear.\nSome types of BTE hearing aids have two microphones that enable you to listen to sounds in the general vicinity or to focus on sounds that are coming from a specific direction. This can be particularly useful in noisy environments.\nOpen fit hearing aids may also be available, which are suitable for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. The tube sits in the ear, instead of an earmould.\nReceiver in-the ear (RITE) hearing aids are similar to BTE hearing aids, but the piece worn behind the ear is connected\u00a0by a wire to a receiver (loudspeaker) located within the ear canal.\nThis means RITE hearing aids are usually less visible than BTE devices.\nIn-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids are like an earmould. They fill the area just outside your ear canal and fill the opening of your ear canal.\nThe working parts of the hearing aid are inside the shell.\nIn-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids fill the outer part of the ear canal and are just visible.\nCompletely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids are even smaller and less visible than ITE or ITC hearing aids.\nHowever, they may not be recommended if you have severe hearing loss or frequent ear infections.\nBody-worn (BW) hearing aids have a small box containing the microphone. The box can be clipped to your clothes or you can put it inside a pocket. A lead connects the box to an earphone, which delivers sound to your ear.\nThis type of hearing aid is an option for people with poor dexterity, who require a high-powered hearing aid.\nCROS hearing aids are recommended for people who only have hearing in one ear. They work by picking up sounds from the side that doesn't have hearing and transmitting them to the ear that's able to hear. The sound is sometimes transmitted through wires, although wireless models are available.\nBiCROS hearing aids work in a similar way to CROS hearing aids, but they amplify the noise entering the ear that's able to hear. They're useful for people who don't have any hearing in one ear, with some\u00a0hearing loss in the other ear.\nBone conduction hearing aids are recommended for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss who can't wear a more conventional type of hearing aid. Bone conduction hearing aids vibrate in response to the sounds going into the microphone.\nThey can also sometimes help people with no hearing in one ear and normal or mild hearing loss in the other ear.\nThe part of the hearing aid that vibrates is held against the bone behind the ear (mastoid) by a headband. The vibrations pass through the mastoid bone to the cochlea and are converted into sound in the usual way. They can be very effective, but can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods.\nA Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) transmits sound directly to the cochlea by vibrating the mastoid bone. A minor operation is needed to fix a screw to the skull, on which the hearing aid can be clipped on and off. A BAHA is removed at night and when you swim or take a shower.\nUnlike a bone conduction hearing aid, it's not uncomfortable to wear and is used for patients with conductive hearing loss, or in some patients who have no hearing in one of their ears.\nSome people may benefit from newer types of implantable bone conduction hearing aids that are held onto the head with magnets instead of a connector through the skin. However, these are only available at some BAHA centres and may require a referral to a different BAHA centre.\nThese are surgically implanted devices that attach to the hearing bones and make them vibrate.\nThey're suitable for people who can't use a hearing aid, but have hearing loss at a level where a BAHA would not help.\nDisposable hearing aids are sometimes recommended for people who have mild to moderate hearing loss.\nThe battery inside a disposable hearing aid usually lasts for about 12 weeks, after which time the hearing aid is thrown away and replaced. Disposable hearing aids\u00a0tend to be\u00a0expensive in the long term\u00a0and are only available privately.\nCochlear implants\nCochlear implants are small hearing devices fitted under the skin behind\u00a0your ear during surgery.\nThey have an external sound processor and internal parts, including a receiver coil, an electronics package and a long wire with electrodes on it (an electrode array).\nThe external processor takes in sound, analyses it and then converts it to signals that are transmitted across the skin to an internal receiver-stimulator, which sends the signals along the electrode array into a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. The signal is then sent to the brain along the hearing nerve as normal. This means cochlear implants are only suitable for people whose hearing nerves are functioning normally.\nA cochlear implant is sometimes recommended\u00a0for adults or children who have severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss\u00a0in both\u00a0ears, which isn't helped by hearing aids.\u00a0\nBoth ears are usually implanted for children, whereas adults are usually only\u00a0able to have\u00a0one implant on the NHS.\nBefore a cochlear implant is recommended, you'll be assessed to find out whether it will help improve your hearing. During the assessment, any disabilities or communication problems you have will be taken into consideration, which may mean the usual hearing tests aren't suitable.\nIf a cochlear implant is recommended, it will be inserted into your ear (or both ears)\u00a0during an operation and switched on a\u00a0few weeks later.\nThere are currently around 11,000 people in the UK with cochlear implants and the number is increasing each year.\nAccording to the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), evidence suggests that patients with cochlear implants may be at an increased risk from pneumococcal meningitis, especially if they haven't been immunised against pneumococcal disease.\u00a0\nIn August 2002, the Department of Health included cochlear implant patients in the population groups who should be immunised against pneumococcal infection.\u00a0\nAlthough the risk of contracting bacterial meningitis is low, it's slightly higher than for the general population.\nAuditory brainstem implants\nIn some cases of severe to profound\u00a0hearing loss, where there are problems with\u00a0the\u00a0nerve that transmits sound to the brain, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be used.\nAn ABI is an electrical device made\u00a0up of:\n\nelectrodes implanted into the part of the brain responsible for processing sound (in the brainstem)\na receiver device placed\u00a0under the skin\u00a0behind your ear\na small sound processor\u00a0outside your ear\n\nWhen\u00a0the microphone in the sound processor picks up sound, it turns it into an electrical signal and\u00a0transmits this to the brain through the receiver and electrodes.\nAn ABI will not fully restore your hearing, but it can usually restore some degree of hearing and can make lip-reading easier. It's\u00a0often used as a treatment for hearing loss associated with a condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).\nLip reading and\u00a0sign language\nHearing\u00a0loss can sometimes affect your speech, as well as your ability to understand other people. Many people with significant hearing\u00a0loss learn to communicate in other ways instead of, or as well as, spoken English.\nFor people who experience hearing loss after they've learnt to talk, lip-reading can be a very useful skill. Lip-reading is where you watch a person\u2019s mouth movements while they're speaking, to understand what they're saying.\nFor people born with a hearing impairment, lip-reading is much more difficult. Those who are born with a hearing impairment often learn sign language, such as British Sign Language (BSL), which is a form of communication that uses hand movements and facial expressions to convey meaning.\nBSL is completely different from spoken English and has its own grammar and syntax (word order). Other types of sign language include Signed English and Paget Gorman Signed Speech.\nThe\u00a0Action on Hearing Loss\u00a0website has more information on British Sign Language (BSL)\u00a0and lip-reading.\u00a0\n\n\nThe ears are fragile structures that can be damaged in many ways, so it's not always possible to prevent hearing loss.\nThe risk of your hearing being damaged by loud noises depends on how loud the noises are and how long you're exposed to them. Experts agree that continued exposure to noise at or above 85dB (similar to a lawn mower or loud traffic) can, over time, cause hearing loss.\nHowever, by following the advice below it's possible to reduce your risk of noise-induced hearing loss (hearing loss from loud noise):\n\nDon't have your television, radio or music on too loud. This is particularly important if you have young children in the house, because their ears are more delicate than an adult\u2019s. If you can't have a comfortable conversation with someone who is two metres (about 6.5ft) away from you, turn the volume down. You shouldn't have dull hearing or ringing in your ears after listening to music.\nUse headphones that block out more outside noise, rather than turning up the volume. You can buy add-ons for your existing headphones that block out more outside noise,\u00a0or noise cancelling headphones.\nUse ear protection equipment such as ear muffs or\u00a0ear plugs\u00a0if you work in a noisy environment,\u00a0such as a pub, nightclub, a garage workshop or on a building site. It's important to insert ear plugs correctly to gain the benefit of wearing them.\nUse ear-protection equipment at loud concerts and at other events where there are high noise levels, such as motor races.\nDon't insert objects into your ears or your children\u2019s ears. This includes fingers, cotton buds, cotton wool and tissue.\nBe aware of the symptoms of common causes of hearing loss, such as\u00a0ear infections (otitis media) and\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\nVisit your GP if you or your child are experiencing hearing problems.\n\nRead more tips to protect your hearing\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Heart failure means that your heart isn't pumping blood around your body as well as it should.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms and effects on your body will depend on the side that is affected.\nSymptoms of heart failure can be severe. It can be treated though, allowing you to control the effects of the condition and continue to live a normal life.\nRead more about\u00a0the symptoms of heart failure\nCauses\nHeart failure can be caused by a number of conditions such as\u00a0high blood pressure or\u00a0heart attack.\nIt tends to affect people over the age of 65, and is more common in men than women.\nRead more about\u00a0the causes of heart failure\n\n\nThe main symptom of heart failure is breathlessness. This, together with some other common symptoms are explained below.\nBreathlessness\nBreathlessness might occur, or become more noticeable, when walking or exerting yourself.\nPeople with more severe heart failure might experience breathlessness when resting and may notice that this gets worse when they lie flat.\nDuring the night, you may wake and feel an urgent need to sit up and get a breath in. A cough and a frothy spit can also accompany the breathlessness.\nTiredness and lethargy\nTiredness and lethargy are also common symptoms of heart failure.\nThis is\u00a0a result of poor blood flow to the body organs including the muscles.\nLeg swelling\nPeople with heart failure have a tendency to retain fluid. This appears as swollen ankles and legs because of excess fluid building up.\nYou may notice that your shoes don't fit and socks appear tight or leave a prominent indent above the ankle.\nLoss of appetite\nPeople with heart failure can also notice a loss of appetite.\nThis is because the liver and stomach can become enlarged, due to excess fluid, making you feel sick (nausea) and have a loss of appetite.\n\n\nIn many cases, the cause of heart failure is unknown or uncertain.\nConditions that can cause heart failure include:\n\nheart attack\u00a0(coronary heart disease)\ninherited heart disease (for example, cardiomyopathy)\nhigh blood pressure\u00a0(hypertension)\nheart rhythm or valve abnormalities\nviral infection and damage from the immune system (myocarditis)\n\nHeart failure on left and right side\nHeart failure on the left side can sometimes lead to heart failure on the right side.\n\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of heart failure, your GP will discuss these with you.\nIf they suspect that you have heart failure, they are likely to suggest that you have a number of tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nTests\nTests to confirm the diagnosis of heart failure include:\n\nblood pressure check\nurine sample\nblood sample\u00a0- to check your blood count and liver function.\u00a0You may get a BNP test (B-type natriuretic peptide), this is a hormone related to heart failure\nchest X-ray\u00a0- to see whether you heart is enlarged and check your lungs for fluid\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) - this records the electrical activity and rhythms of your heart\nan echocardiogram - an ultrasound scan that will check the pumping action of your heart and the function of the valves in your heart\n\nMore about tests for heart conditions\n\n\nHeart failure results from impairment of the heart's pumping action. Commonly this is related to heart muscle damage that cannot be repaired. However, many treatments available can help to keep the condition under control and help to relieve the symptoms.\nIn addition, many of the conditions that cause heart failure can also be treated effectively. This reduces the pressure on your heart and prevents further deterioration.\nMedicines\nThe information below highlights the medication that you may\u00a0be prescribed by your GP or specialist. This will be after discussing treatment options with you and identifying the appropriate choice for your individual circumstances.\nThe standard medicines for treating heart failure are:\n\nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\nangiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)\nbeta blockers\ndiuretics (water tablets)\nmineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)\n\nACE inhibitors relax and widen your blood vessels. This helps to improve the flow of blood around your body, which reduces the amount of work your heart has to do.\nACE inhibitors have been shown to improve the symptoms of heart failure, reduce the need for hospital admission and improve life expectancy caused by heart failure.\nYour symptoms should improve within a few weeks of starting treatment.\nThe main side effects of ACE inhibitors are dizziness (caused by your blood pressure being too low) and a cough. You will need to have regular blood tests, at least once every year, while taking an ACE inhibitor.\nIf you are taking an ACE inhibitor, you should check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines. In particular, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) should not be taken with an ACE inhibitor. You should also avoid products containing high levels of potassium, such as salt substitutes.\nCaptopril, enalapril, lisinopril and ramipril\nARBs work in a similar way to ACE inhibitors.\nUnlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not cause a cough. For this reason, they are often prescribed for people who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor due to cough.\nCandesartan and valsartan\nIf your heart isn\u2019t working properly, your body produces hormones to try and make it work better by making your heart pump faster and raising your blood pressure. However, if this continues, it can have harmful effects on your heart.\nBeta-blockers block the action of these hormones. This slows your heart down and reduces your blood pressure, meaning that the heart has less work to do.\nBeta-blockers have been shown to reduce the symptoms of heart failure, reduce the need for hospital admission and improve life expectancy caused by heart failure.\nPeople with moderate or severe heart failure usually need to start with a low dose of beta-blocker, which will be slowly increased. This is because some people experience a temporary increase in their heart failure symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment.\nIf you feel that your symptoms are getting worse, do not stop your beta blocker. Seek medical advice.\nBisoprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol\nWhen you have heart failure, your heart cannot pump blood around your body as well as it should, so fluid builds up in your body. This fluid can collect in your lungs, making you breathless, or in your legs and ankles, making them swell (oedema). Diuretics increase the amount of water and salt that is removed from your body as urine. As more fluid passes out, there is less fluid left in your blood, so the excess water in your lungs and legs is drawn back into your blood, relieving your symptoms of breathlessness and oedema.\nDiuretics are usually taken in the morning. The effect of making you pass more water starts about half an hour after taking them, and you may find you need to go to the toilet several times over the next few hours. Their effect wears off after about 6 hours, so you should not need to get up at night to go to the toilet.\nThe accumulation of fluid in your body can be measured as a gain in weight, and the loss of fluid (caused by the diuretic) can be measured as weight loss. Therefore by weighing yourself every day you can pick up any sudden increase in weight.\nA sudden increase in weight means that your heart failure is not well controlled and you should seek help urgently from your doctor or heart failure nurse.\nBumetanide and furosemide\nMRAs work by blocking the action of a chemical called aldosterone in the body. Aldosterone causes salt and fluid to build up, so MRAs help to prevent this, reducing the symptoms of heart failure, reducing the need for hospital admission and improving life expectancy caused by heart failure.\nThe main side effect of MRAs is dizziness (caused by your blood pressure being too low). You will need regular blood tests, at least twice a year, to measure a salt called potassium which can become too high in some people.\nIf you are taking an MRA, you should check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medicines. In particular, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) should not be taken with an MRA. You should also avoid products containing high levels of potassium, such as salt substitutes.\nIf you experience diarrhoea and/or vomiting, stop the MRA and contact your doctor.\nSpironolactone and eplerenone\nMedicines that might be used by a specialist include:\n\nangiotensin/neprilysin inhibitors\nivabradine\ndigoxin\n\nThis is a new type of drug to treat heart failure. It is a combination of valsartan (an ARB) and a medicine called sacubitril. It may be used for people with more severe heart failure, or people with ongoing symptoms despite the standard treatments described above. It has been shown to reduce the symptoms of heart failure, reduce the need for hospital admission and improve life expectancy.\nIf you are already taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, this will need to be stopped for 36 hours before you start to take the angiotensin/neprilysin inhibitor. This is to reduce the risk of serious side effects occurring.\nYou will need regular blood tests, at least once per year, while taking this medicine.\nEntresto\u00ae\nIvabradine reduces the number of times your heart beats each minute (your heart rate), meaning that the heart has less work to do. It has been shown to reduce the need for hospital admission in people with heart failure.\nIvabradine is not suitable for everyone with heart failure. It is only needed if you have a fast heart rate despite being treated with a beta blocker or if you cannot tolerate a beta-blocker. It is not suitable for people with a particular type of irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.\nDigoxin can also reduce the heart rate and improve the symptoms of heart failure. It is most useful in people who have irregular heart rhythms.\nIt is important that you get the right dose of digoxin for you. You will need to have regular blood tests to check this. If you have too much digoxin you may develop nausea, headaches and blurred vision. If you experience any of these whilst you are taking digoxin, you should contact your doctor.\nHeart transplant\nA heart transplant may be an option for people with severe heart failure, but it is not an option for everyone.\nIt is also dependant on the availability of a suitable donor heart.\nMental wellbeing\nPeople with heart failure often experience various types of emotional distress or behavioural disturbance. Problems such as depression and anxiety are especially common.\nThese conditions not only affect individuals\u2019 emotional state but can also affect their symptoms of heart failure and influence the success of their medical care.\nFortunately, there are effective treatments for depression and anxiety available including psychological interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy and antidepressant medication. Addressing these problems will make it easier to follow your heart failure treatment plan.\nYour healthcare professional or GP will be able to help assess any concerns you have regarding your psychological wellbeing.\nImmunisations\nIf you have heart failure, you have a higher risk of complications from flu and pneumococcal infection. To reduce this risk, you'll be offered a:\n\nyearly flu vaccine\none-off pneumococcal immunisation\n\nWatch Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland's video on living with heart failure.\n\n\nThere are many ways to\u00a0reduce your chances of heart failure.\nThe following measures can help to reduce the strain on your heart by avoiding risk factors such as obesity and blood pressure problems, and by making sure the heart muscle is healthy.\nAvoid smoking\nIf you would like to stop smoking:\n\ncall Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0for advice free on 0800 84 84 84 (7 days, 8.00am to 10.00pm)\nvisit our healthy living section on\u00a0smoking\u00a0for information to help you to stop\n\nAvoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\nFind information and advice on reducing alcohol intake in our healthy living section on alcohol.\nTake regular exercise\nFind information and advice to help you keep active and take regular exercise in our healthy living section on physical activity.\nEat a healthy diet\nA diet low in saturated fats and salt is recommended as salt assists fluid retention.\nFind information and advice on having a healthy diet\u00a0in our healthy living section on diet and nutrition.\nImmunisations\nGet immunised against flu and pneumococcal infections if you're in an at-risk group.\nMore about immunisations in Scotland\nIf you have high blood pressure\nIf you have high blood pressure, maintain good control of it.\nUse medication if and as prescribed and always attend review appointments.\nIf you are diabetic\nIf you are diabetic, maintain good control of it and always attend review appointments.\nManage your diet as explained by your specialist nurse or Dr and use medication if and as prescribed.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Hepatitis\u00a0A is a liver\u00a0infection caused by a virus that's spread in the poo of an infected person.\nIt's uncommon in the UK,\u00a0but certain\u00a0groups are at increased risk.

You can usually look after yourself at home.\nHowever, it's still a good idea to see your GP for a\u00a0blood test if you think you could have hepatitis A, as more serious conditions can have similar symptoms.\nYour GP can also\u00a0advise you about treatments and they may carry out\u00a0regular blood tests to check how well your liver is working.\nGo back\u00a0to your GP if your symptoms get worse or haven't started to improve within a couple of months.\nRelieving your symptoms\nThe following advice may help:\n\nGet plenty of rest,\u00a0especially during the initial stages of the infection, as\u00a0you will probably\u00a0feel very tired.\nTake painkillers such as\u00a0paracetamol\u00a0or\u00a0ibuprofen\u00a0if you have any aches and pains\u00a0\u2013 how much you can take depends on how well your liver is working; ask your GP for advice.\nReduce itching by\u00a0maintaining a cool, well-ventilated environment, wearing loose clothing and avoiding\u00a0hot baths or showers\u00a0\u2013 your GP may recommend using\u00a0an antihistamine\u00a0in severe cases.\nEat smaller, lighter meals to help reduce nausea and vomiting\u00a0\u2013 your GP can prescribe a medication called an antiemetic if the problem persists.\nAvoid alcohol\u00a0\u2013 drinking alcohol can put additional strain on your liver, so avoid it until your GP says it's safe.\n\nPreventing the spread of infection\nWhile you're ill, it's also\u00a0important to try to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.\nYou should:\n\nStay off work or school until at least a week after your\u00a0jaundice or other symptoms started.\nAvoid preparing food for others if possible.\nWash your hands with soap and water regularly\u00a0\u2013 particularly after going to the toilet and before preparing food.\nAvoid\u00a0sharing towels and wash soiled laundry separately on a hot cycle.\nClean the toilet, flush handles and taps more frequently than usual.\nAvoid having sex while you're infectious\u00a0\u2013 hepatitis A is most infectious from around 2\u00a0weeks before the symptoms start until about a week after they first develop. Ask your GP for advice about this.\n\nAny close contacts, such as people who live in the same house as you, may be advised to have the\u00a0hepatitis A vaccine to reduce their risk of becoming infected.\n\n\nVaccination against hepatitis A isn't routinely offered in the UK because the risk of infection is low for most people.\u00a0It's only recommended for people at high\u00a0risk.\nWho should have the hepatitis A vaccine\nPeople usually advised to have the hepatitis A vaccine include:\n\nclose contacts of someone with hepatitis A\npeople\u00a0planning to travel to or live in parts of the world where hepatitis A is widespread, particularly if levels of sanitation and food hygiene are expected to be poor\npeople with\u00a0any type of long-term (chronic)\u00a0liver disease\nmen who have sex with other men\npeople who inject illegal drugs\npeople who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job\u00a0\u2013 this includes\u00a0sewage workers, staff of\u00a0institutions where levels of personal hygiene may be poor (such as a homeless shelter) and people working with\u00a0monkeys, apes and gorillas\n\nContact your GP surgery if you think you\u00a0should have\u00a0the hepatitis A vaccine or you're not sure whether you need it.\nTypes of hepatitis A vaccine\nThere are 3\u00a0main types of hepatitis A vaccination:\n\na vaccine for hepatitis A only\na combined vaccine for hepatitis A and hepatitis B\na combined vaccine for hepatitis A and\u00a0typhoid fever\n\nTalk to your GP about which vaccine is most suitable for you. All 3\u00a0types are usually\u00a0available\u00a0for free on the NHS.\nIf you've travelling abroad, try to plan your vaccinations in advance. They should ideally be started at least\u00a0two or three\u00a0weeks before you leave, although some\u00a0can be given up to the day of your departure if necessary.\nExtra\u00a0doses of the\u00a0vaccine are often recommended after 6-12 months if you need long-term protection.\nYou can find more information about the various hepatitis A vaccines on the NHS Fit for Travel website.\nSide effects of the hepatitis A vaccine\nSome people develop temporary soreness, redness and hardening of the skin at the injection site after having the hepatitis A vaccine.\nA small, painless lump may also form, but\u00a0this usually disappears quickly and isn't a cause for concern.\nLess common side effects include:\n\na slightly raised temperature\nfeeling unwell\ntiredness\nheadache\nfeeling sick\nloss of appetite\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Hepatitis B\u00a0is\u00a0an infection of the liver caused by a virus that's spread through blood and body fluids.\nIt often doesn't cause any obvious symptoms in adults\u00a0and typically passes in a few months without treatment, but in\u00a0children it\u00a0often persists for years and may eventually cause serious liver damage.\nHepatitis B is less common in the UK than other parts of the world, but certain groups are at an increased risk. This includes people originally from high-risk countries, people who inject drugs, and people who have unprotected sex with multiple sexual partners.\nA\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine is available for people at high risk of the condition.\nSymptoms\u00a0of hepatitis B\nMany people with hepatitis B won't experience any symptoms and may fight off the virus without realising they had it.\nIf symptoms do develop, they tend to occur 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0months after exposure to the hepatitis B virus.\nSymptoms of hepatitis B include:\n\nflu-like symptoms, including tiredness, a fever, and general aches and pains\nloss of appetite\nfeeling and being\u00a0sick\ndiarrhoea\nabdominal pain\nyellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\n\nThese symptoms will usually pass within one to three months (acute hepatitis B), although\u00a0occasionally the infection can last for six months or more (chronic hepatitis B).\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of hepatitis B.\nWhen\u00a0to get medical advice\nHepatitis B can be serious, so you should get medical advice if:\n\nyou think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus\u00a0\u2013 emergency treatment can help prevent infection if given within a\u00a0few days of exposure\nyou have symptoms\u00a0associated with\u00a0hepatitis B\nyou're at a high risk of hepatitis B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0high-risk groups include people born in a country where the infection is common, babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B, and people who have ever injected drugs\n\nYou can go to\u00a0your local\u00a0GP surgery, drug service, genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or sexual health clinic\u00a0for help and advice.\nA\u00a0blood test\u00a0can be carried out to check if you have hepatitis B or have had it in the past.\u00a0The hepatitis B vaccine may also be recommended to reduce your risk of infection.\nTreatments\u00a0for hepatitis B\nTreatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you've been infected for:\n\nif you've been exposed to the virus in the last few days, emergency treatment can help stop you becoming infected\nif you've only had the infection for a few weeks or months (acute hepatitis B), you may only need treatment to relieve your symptoms while your body fights off the infection\nif you've had the infection for more than 6\u00a0months (chronic hepatitis B), you may be offered treatment with medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage\n\nChronic hepatitis B often requires long-term or lifelong treatment and regular monitoring to check for any further liver problems.\nRead more about treating hepatitis B.\nHow\u00a0hepatitis B is spread\nThe hepatitis B virus is found\u00a0in the\u00a0blood and bodily fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluids, of an infected person.\nIt can be spread by:\n\na mother to her newborn baby, particularly in countries where the infection is common\u00a0\nwithin families (child to child) in countries where the infection is common\ninjecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters\nhaving sex with an infected person without using a\u00a0condom\nhaving a tattoo,\u00a0body piercing, or medical or dental treatment in an unhygienic environment with unsterilised equipment\nsharing toothbrushes or razors contaminated with infected blood\n\nHepatitis B isn't spread\u00a0by kissing,\u00a0holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or sharing crockery\u00a0and utensils.\nRead more about the causes of hepatitis B.\nPreventing\u00a0hepatitis B\nA vaccine that offers protection against hepatitis B is available for all\u00a0babies born in the UK on or after 1 August 2017.

Most will then be immune to the infection for life.\nBabies and children with hepatitis B are more likely to develop a chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B affects around:\n\n90% of babies with hepatitis B\n20% of older children with hepatitis B\n5% of adults with hepatitis B\n\nAlthough treatment can help, there's a risk that people with\u00a0chronic hepatitis B could eventually develop life-threatening problems such as\u00a0scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) or\u00a0liver cancer.\nRead more about complications of hepatitis B.\n\n\nOnly some people with hepatitis B experience symptoms, which usually develop 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0months after\u00a0exposure to the hepatitis B virus.\nMany people\u00a0infected in adulthood won't\u00a0experience any symptoms and will fight off the infection without realising they had it.\nHowever, they'll still be able to pass the virus on to others while they're infected.\nRead more about how hepatitis B is spread.\nMain symptoms of hepatitis B\nSymptoms of hepatitis B can include:\n\ntiredness\ngeneral aches and pains\na\u00a0high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\u00a0\na general sense of feeling unwell\nloss of appetite\nfeeling and being\u00a0sick\ndiarrhoea\nabdominal pain\nyellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\ndark urine and pale, grey-coloured\u00a0poo\n\nMany of these symptoms can be mistaken for more common illnesses, such as flu\u00a0or gastroenteritis.\nHow long do symptoms of hepatitis B last?\nHepatitis B in adults will usually pass within 1\u00a0to 3\u00a0months. This is known as acute hepatitis B and rarely causes any serious problems.\nOccasionally, the infection can last for 6\u00a0months or more. This is known as chronic hepatitis B.\nChronic hepatitis B\u00a0mainly affects babies and young children who get hepatitis B. It's much less common in people\u00a0who become infected later in childhood or when they're an adult.\nThe symptoms\u00a0of chronic hepatitis B are the same as those mentioned above, but they tend to be quite mild and may come and go. Some people may not have any noticeable symptoms.\nHowever,\u00a0without treatment, people with chronic hepatitis B can develop problems such as\u00a0scarring of the liver (cirrhosis).\nRead more about treatments for hepatitis B and complications of hepatitis B.\n\n\nHepatitis B is an infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. The virus is found in the blood and bodily fluids of an infected person.\nMany people with hepatitis B have few symptoms and\u00a0may not\u00a0know they're infected. They may spread the infection without realising it.\nHepatitis B is most often caught in parts of the world where the infection is more common, although\u00a0certain groups of\u00a0people are at\u00a0risk of\u00a0picking up the\u00a0infection in the UK.\nHow hepatitis B is spread\nHepatitis B can be spread by:\n\na mother to their newborn baby, particularly in\u00a0countries where the infection is common\u00a0\u2013\u00a0all pregnant women in the UK are offered screening for\u00a0hepatitis B;\u00a0babies of infected mothers are vaccinated immediately after birth to help prevent infection\ninjecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters\nhaving sex with an infected person without using a condom\nhaving a tattoo, body piercing, or\u00a0medical or dental treatment\u00a0in an\u00a0unhygienic environment with unsterilised equipment\nhaving a\u00a0blood transfusion\u00a0in a country where blood isn't tested for hepatitis B\u00a0\u2013 all blood donations in the UK are now tested for the infection\nsharing toothbrushes or razors contaminated with infected blood\nthe skin being\u00a0accidentally punctured by a used needle (needle stick injury)\u00a0\u2013 this is mainly a risk for healthcare workers\nthe blood of someone with hepatitis B\u00a0getting into an open wound, cut, or scratch \u2013 in rare cases, being bitten by someone with hepatitis B can also spread the infection\n\nHepatitis B isn't spread\u00a0by kissing,\u00a0holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or sharing crockery\u00a0and utensils.\nWho's\u00a0most at risk of hepatitis B?\nPeople at highest risk of hepatitis B include:\n\npeople born or brought up in a\u00a0country where the infection is common\nbabies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B\npeople who have ever injected drugs\nanyone who has had unprotected sex, including anal or oral sex \u2013 particularly people who've had multiple sexual partners, people who've had sex with someone in or from a high-risk area, men who have sex with men, and commercial sex workers\nclose contacts, such as family members, of someone with long-term (chronic) hepatitis B infection\n\nThe risk\u00a0of getting hepatitis B for travellers going\u00a0to places where the infection is common is generally considered to be low if the activities mentioned above are avoided.\nYour GP can arrange for you to have a blood\u00a0test to check for hepatitis B and have the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccination\u00a0if you're at a high risk.\nHigh-risk\u00a0areas\nHepatitis B is\u00a0found\u00a0throughout the world, but is\u00a0particularly common in:\n\nsub-Saharan Africa\neast and southeast Asia\nthe Pacific Islands\nparts of South America\nsouthern parts of eastern and central Europe\nthe Middle East\nthe Indian subcontinent\n\nMost new cases of hepatitis B in the UK occur in people who caught the infection in one of these areas before moving to the UK.\n\n\nTreatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you've been infected for:\n\nshort-term (acute) hepatitis B\u00a0doesn't usually need specific treatment, but may require treatment to relieve the symptoms\nlong-term (chronic) hepatitis B\u00a0is\u00a0often treated with medication to keep the virus under control\n\nEmergency treatment\u00a0can also be given soon after possible exposure to the hepatitis B virus to stop an infection developing.\nEmergency\u00a0hepatitis B treatment\nSee your GP as soon as possible if you think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus.\nTo help stop you becoming infected, they can give you:\n\na dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine \u2013 you'll also need 2\u00a0further doses over the next few months to give you long-term protection\nhepatitis B immunoglobulin\u00a0\u2013 a preparation of antibodies that work against the hepatitis B virus and can offer immediate but short-term protection until the vaccine starts to take effect\n\nThese are most effective if given within 48 hours after possible exposure to hepatitis B,\u00a0but you can still have them up to a week after exposure.\nTreatment\u00a0for acute hepatitis B\nIf you're diagnosed with hepatitis B, your GP will usually refer you to\u00a0a specialist, such as a hepatologist (liver specialist).\nMany people don't have any troublesome symptoms, but if you do feel unwell, it can help to:\n\nget plenty of rest\ntake over-the-counter painkillers, such as\u00a0paracetamol or ibuprofen, for abdominal pain\nmaintain a cool, well-ventilated environment, wear loose clothing, and avoid hot baths or showers if itching is a problem\ntake medication\u00a0such as\u00a0metoclopramide to stop you feeling sick and chlorphenamine to reduce itching\u00a0\u2013 your doctor can give you\u00a0a prescription for these if necessary\n\nMost people recover completely in a couple of months, but you'll be advised to have regular blood tests\u00a0to check\u00a0that you're free of the virus and haven't developed chronic hepatitis B.\nTreatment\u00a0for chronic hepatitis B\nIf blood tests show that you still have hepatitis B after 6\u00a0months, your doctor may recommend medication to reduce the risk of complications of hepatitis B\u00a0and\u00a0regular tests to assess the\u00a0health of your liver.\nTreatment is usually offered if:\n\nyour immune system is unable to control the hepatitis B\u00a0by\u00a0itself\nthere's evidence of ongoing liver damage\n\nHepatitis B\u00a0medications\u00a0can help keep the virus under control and stop it damaging\u00a0your liver, although\u00a0they won't\u00a0necessarily cure the infection and some people need lifelong treatment.\nThe main medicines for chronic hepatitis B are outlined below.\nIf your liver is working fairly well, the first treatment offered is usually a medicine called\u00a0peginterferon alfa 2-a.\nThis stimulates the immune system to attack the hepatitis B virus and regain control over it. It's usually given by injection once a week for 48 weeks.\nCommon side effects include\u00a0flu-like symptoms, such as a\u00a0fever and muscle and joint pain, after you start\u00a0to take the medicine, although these should improve with time.\nTests will be carried out during treatment to see how well\u00a0it's working. Alternative medicines may be recommended if it's not helping.\nIf\u00a0your liver isn't working well, or peginterferon alpha-2a is not suitable or not working for you, your doctor may recommend trying antiviral medication instead.\nThis\u00a0will\u00a0usually\u00a0be either tenofovir\u00a0or entecavir, both of which\u00a0are taken as tablets.\nCommon side effects of these medicines include feeling sick, vomiting and dizziness.\nLiving with hepatitis B\nIf you have hepatitis, you should:\n\navoid having unprotected sex\u00a0\u2013 including anal and oral sex, unless you're sure your partner has\u00a0been vaccinated against hepatitis B\navoid sharing needles used to inject drugs with other people\ntake precautions to avoid the spread of infection\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0not sharing toothbrushes or razors with other people; close contacts such as family members may need to be vaccinated\neat a generally healthy,\u00a0balanced diet\u00a0\u2013 there's no special diet for people with hepatitis B\navoid drinking alcohol\u00a0\u2013 this can increase your risk of developing serious liver problems\nspeak to your doctor if you're thinking of having a baby\n\nPeople with hepatitis B can usually have a healthy pregnancy, but it's a good idea to discuss your plans with a doctor first as you may need extra care and your medications may need to be changed.\nThere's a risk of pregnant women with hepatitis B passing the infection on\u00a0to their child around the time of the birth, but this risk can be reduced by ensuring the baby is vaccinated shortly after they're born.\n\n\nPeople with hepatitis B can sometimes develop serious liver problems. These mostly affect people with an untreated\u00a0long-term (chronic) infection.\nSome of the main problems associated with hepatitis B are outlined below.\nCirrhosis\nScarring of the liver (cirrhosis) affects around 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0people with chronic hepatitis B, often many years after they first\u00a0got the infection.\nCirrhosis doesn't usually cause any noticeable symptoms until extensive damage to the liver has occurred, when it can cause:\n\ntiredness and weakness\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\nfeeling sick\nvery itchy skin\ntenderness,\u00a0pain, or swelling\u00a0in the tummy\nswelling of the ankles\n\nThere's currently no cure for cirrhosis, although it's possible to manage the symptoms and slow its progression.\u00a0If the liver becomes severely damaged,\u00a0a liver transplant\u00a0may be needed.\nRead more about the\u00a0treatments for cirrhosis.\nLiver cancer\nPeople with cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B have around a 1 in 20 chance of developing liver cancer\u00a0every year.\nSymptoms of liver cancer include:\n\nunexplained weight loss\nloss of appetite\nfeeling very full after eating, even if the meal was small\nfeeling\u00a0and being sick\nyellow skin and eyes (jaundice)\n\nTreatment for liver cancer may involve surgery to remove the affected section of liver, a procedure to destroy the cancerous cells, or a liver transplant.\nRead more about the treatments for liver cancer.\nFulminant hepatitis B\nIn less than 1 in 100 cases, short-term (acute) hepatitis B can lead to a serious problem called\u00a0fulminant hepatitis B.\nThis is where the immune system attacks the liver and causes extensive damage to it.\nIt can lead to symptoms such as:\n\nconfusion\ncollapsing\nswelling of the\u00a0tummy\u00a0caused by\u00a0a build-up of fluid\nsevere jaundice\n\nFulminant hepatitis B\u00a0can\u00a0cause the liver to stop working properly and is often fatal if not treated quickly.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Hepatitis C is a virus that can infect the liver.

A blood test can be carried out to see if you have the infection.\nYour GP, sexual health clinic, GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinic or drug treatment service all offer testing for hepatitis C. Testing is available at most substance use recovery services and also a variety of third sector services.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or limit any damage to your liver and help ensure the infection isn't passed on to other people.\nRead more about testing for hepatitis C.\nTreatments for hepatitis C\nHepatitis C can be treated with a single, or combination of, medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. Traditionally hepatitis C was treated with interferon (an injection) and ribavirin. New, all-oral medicines are now available for everyone and treatment is usually only for 8 to 12 weeks.\nUsing these latest medications, around 95% or more of people with hepatitis C will be cured. However, it's important to be aware that you won't be immune to the infection and should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again.\nRead more about treating hepatitis C and living with hepatitis C.\nComplications of hepatitis C\nIf the infection is left untreated for many years, some people with hepatitis C will develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). Over time, this can cause the liver to stop working properly.\nIn severe cases, life-threatening problems such as liver failure (where the liver loses most or all of its functions) or liver cancer can eventually develop.\nTreating hepatitis C as early as possible can help reduce the risk of these problems occurring.\nRead more about the complications of hepatitis C.\nPreventing hepatitis C\nThere's no vaccine for hepatitis C, but there are ways to reduce your risk of becoming infected, such as:\n\nnot sharing any drug-injecting equipment with other people \u2013 including needles and other equipment such as syringes, spoons and filters\nnot sharing razors or toothbrushes that might be contaminated with blood\n\nThe risk of getting hepatitis C through vaginal sex is very low. However, it may be higher if blood is present, such as menstrual blood or from minor bleeding during anal sex.\nCondoms aren't usually necessary to prevent hepatitis C for long-term heterosexual couples, but it's a very good idea to use them when having anal sex or sex with a new partner.\n\n\nMany people with hepatitis C don't have any symptoms and are unaware they have the infection. They may develop symptoms later on as their liver becomes increasingly damaged.\nEarly symptoms\nOnly around 1 in every 3 or 4 people will have any symptoms during the first 6 months of a hepatitis C infection. This stage is known as acute hepatitis C.\nIf symptoms do develop, they usually occur a few weeks after infection. Symptoms may include:\n\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\ntiredness\nloss of appetite\nabdominal pains\nfeeling and being sick\n\nAround 1 in every 5 people who experiences symptoms will also have yellowing of the eyes and skin. This is known as jaundice.\nIn around 1 in every 4 people infected with hepatitis C, the immune system will kill the virus within a few months and the person will have no further symptoms, unless they become infected again.\nIn the remaining cases, the virus persists inside the body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis.\nLater symptoms\nThe symptoms of long-term (chronic) hepatitis C can vary widely. In some people, symptoms may be barely noticeable. In others, they can have a significant impact on quality of life.\nThe symptoms can also go away for long periods of time and then return.\nSome of the most common problems experienced by people with chronic hepatitis C include:\n\nfeeling tired all the time\njoint and muscle aches and pain\nfeeling sick\nproblems with short-term memory, concentration and completing complex mental tasks such as mental arithmetic \u2013 many people describe this as \"brain fog\"\nmood swings\ndepression or anxiety\nindigestion or bloating\nitchy skin\nabdominal pain\n\nIf left untreated, the infection can eventually cause the liver to become scarred (cirrhosis). Signs of cirrhosis can include jaundice, vomiting blood, dark stools and a build-up of fluid in the legs or abdomen.\nRead more about the complications of hepatitis C.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee your GP if you persistently have any of the later symptoms above, or if they keep returning. They may recommend having a blood test that can check for hepatitis C. Read more about diagnosing hepatitis C.\nNone of the symptoms above mean you definitely have hepatitis C, but it's important to get them checked out.\nYou should also speak to your GP about getting tested if there's a risk you're infected, even if you don't have any symptoms. This particularly includes people who inject drugs or have done so in the past.\nRead about the causes of hepatitis C for more information about who's at risk of having the infection.\n\n\nYou can become infected with hepatitis C if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person.\nOther bodily fluids can also contain the virus, but blood contains the highest level of it. Just a small trace of blood can cause an infection. At room temperature, it's thought the virus may be able survive outside the body in patches of dried blood on surfaces for up to several weeks.\nThe main ways you can become infected with the hepatitis C virus are described below.\nInjecting drugs\nPeople who inject drugs, including illegal recreational drugs and performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids, are at the highest risk of becoming infected with hepatitis C.\nAlmost 90% of hepatitis C cases in the UK occur in people who inject drugs or have injected them in the past. It's estimated that around half of the people in the UK who inject drugs have the infection.\nThe infection can be spread by sharing needles and associated equipment. Injecting yourself with just one contaminated needle may be enough to become infected.\nIt's also possible to get the infection by sharing other equipment used to prepare or take drugs \u2013 such as spoons, filters, pipes and straws \u2013 that have been contaminated with infected blood.\nLess common causes\nHepatitis C may be transmitted during unprotected sex (sex without using a condom), although this risk is considered very low.\nThe risk of transmission through sex may be higher among men who have sex with men. The risk is also increased if there are genital sores or ulcers from a sexually transmitted infection, or if either person also has HIV.\nThe best way to prevent transmission of hepatitis C through sex is to use a male condom or female condom. However, as the risk is very low for couples in a long-term relationship, many choose not to use a condom.\nIf your partner has hepatitis C, you should be tested for the condition.\nSince September 1991, all blood donated in the UK is checked for the hepatitis C virus. If you received blood transfusions or blood products before this date, there's a small possibility you may have been infected with hepatitis C.\nIf you have a blood transfusion or medical or dental treatment overseas where medical equipment is not sterilised properly, you may become infected with hepatitis C. The virus can survive in traces of blood left on equipment.\nThere's a potential risk that hepatitis C may be passed on through sharing items such as toothbrushes, razors and scissors, as they can become contaminated with infected blood.\nEquipment used by hairdressers, such as scissors and clippers, can pose a risk if it has been contaminated with infected blood and not been sterilised or cleaned between customers. However, most salons operate to high standards, so this risk is low.\nThere is a risk that hepatitis C may be passed on through using tattooing or body piercing equipment that has not been properly sterilised. However, most tattoo and body piercing parlours in the UK operate to high standards and are regulated by law, so this risk is low.\nThere is a small chance that a mother who is infected with the hepatitis C virus will pass the infection on to her baby. This happens in around 5% of cases.\nIt's not thought that the virus can be passed on by a mother to her baby in her breast milk.\nThere's a small (approximately one in 30) risk of getting hepatitis C if your skin is accidentally punctured by a needle used by someone with hepatitis C.\nHealthcare workers, nurses and laboratory technicians are at increased risk because they are in regular close contact with blood and bodily fluids that may contain blood.\n\n\nIf you think you may have been exposed to hepatitis C, taking a test will put your mind at rest or, if the test is positive, allow you to start treatment early.\nGP surgeries, sexual health clinics, GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics or drug treatment services all offer testing for hepatitis C. A variety of sexual health and social support third sector services also provide testing.\nWho should get tested?\nYou should consider getting tested for hepatitis C if you're worried you could have been infected or you fall into one of the groups at an increased risk of being infected.\nHepatitis C often has no symptoms, so you may still be infected if you feel healthy.\nThe following groups of people are at an increased risk of hepatitis C:\n\nex-drug users and current drug users, particularly users of injected drugs\npeople who received blood transfusions before September 1991\nrecipients of organ or tissue transplants before 1992\npeople who have lived or had medical treatment in an area where hepatitis C is common \u2013 high risk areas include North Africa, the Middle East and Central and East Asia\nbabies and children whose mothers have hepatitis C\nanyone accidentally exposed to the virus, such as health workers\npeople who have received a tattoo or piercing where equipment may not have been properly sterilised\nsexual partners of people with hepatitis C\n\nIf you continue to engage in high-risk activities, such as injecting drugs frequently, regular testing may be recommended. Your doctor will be able to advise you about this.\nTesting for hepatitis C\nHepatitis C is usually diagnosed using 2 blood tests: the antibody test and the PCR test. These can be as part of a routine blood test or are often combined as a dried blood spot test. The dried blood spot test is similar to a blood sugar test in pricking the finger to get a blood spot that is put on a testing card. This is then sent to a laboratory to be tested.\nAnother similar test is an antigen test, which if used can often get the results back in 90 minutes. This is very expensive and not many services have access to the machine needed.\nThe antibody test\nThe antibody blood test determines whether you have ever been exposed to the hepatitis C virus by testing for the presence of antibodies to the virus. Antibodies are produced by your immune system to fight germs.\nThe test will not show a positive reaction for some months after infection because your body takes time to make these antibodies.\nIf the test is negative, but you have symptoms or you may have been exposed to hepatitis C, you may be advised to have the test again.\nA positive test indicates that you have been infected at some stage. It doesn't necessarily mean you are currently infected, as you may have since cleared the virus from your body.\nThe only way to tell if you are currently infected is to have a second blood test, called a PCR test.\nThe PCR test\nThe PCR blood test checks if the virus is still present by detecting whether it is reproducing inside your body.\nA positive test means that your body has not fought off the virus, and the infection has progressed to a chronic (long-term) stage.\nFurther tests\nIf you have an active hepatitis C infection, you will be referred to a specialist for further tests to check if your liver has been damaged.\nThe tests you may have include:\n\nblood tests \u2013 these measure certain enzymes and proteins in your bloodstream that indicate whether your liver is damaged or inflamed\nultrasound scans \u2013 where sound waves are used to test how stiff your liver is (stiffness suggests the liver is scarred)\n\nThe specialist can also talk to you about any treatment you may need. Read more about treating hepatitis C.\n\n\nHepatitis C can be treated with a single, or combination of, medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. Traditionally hepatitis C was treated with interferon (an injection) and ribavirin. New, all-oral medicines are now available for everyone and treatment is usually only for 8\u00a0to 12 weeks.\nUsing these latest medications, around 95% or more of people with hepatitis C will be cured. However, it's important to be aware that you won't be immune to the infection and should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again.\nIf the infection is diagnosed in the early stages, known as acute hepatitis, treatment may not need to begin straight away. Instead, you may have another blood test after a few months to see if your body fights off the virus.\nIf the infection continues for several months, known as chronic hepatitis, treatment will usually be recommended.\nYour treatment plan\nTreatment for hepatitis C involves:\n\nmaking lifestyle changes to help prevent further damage to your liver and reduce the risk of spreading the infection\ntaking medications to fight the virus\n\nYou'll normally need to take medication for 8\u00a0to 12 weeks. This length of time will depend on the exact medicines you're taking and which version (strain) of the hepatitis C virus you have. Your doctor will advise you about this.\nThere are 6 main strains of the virus. In the UK, the most common strains are known as \"genotype 1\" and \"genotype 3\".\nDuring treatment, you should have blood tests to check if your medication is working. Using these latest medications, around 95% or more of people with hepatitis C will be cured.\nLifestyle measures\nThere are some things you can do to help limit or even undo any damage to your liver and before you start treatment you can prevent the infection spreading to others. These can include:\n\neating a healthy and balanced diet\nexercising regularly\ncutting out alcohol or limiting your intake\nstopping smoking\nkeeping personal items, such as toothbrushes or razors, for your own use\nnot sharing any needles or syringes with others\n\nRead some FAQs about living with hepatitis C for more information.\nHepatitis C medications\nUntil relatively recently, treatment for chronic hepatitis C usually involved taking 2 main medicines:\n\npegylated interferon\nribavirin\n\nNewer medications\nThere are now a number of new medicines, called direct acting antivirals (DAA) that are always used to treat hepatitis C . DAA tablets are the safest and most effective medicines for treating hepatitis C.\nThese medications are taken as tablets once or twice a day, for between eight and 16 weeks, depending on the exact medicine you're taking, your hepatitis C genotype and the severity of your condition.\nSome types of hepatitis C can be treated using more than 1 type of DAA.\nNHS-approved hepatitis C medicines include:\n\nsofosbuvir\na combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir\na combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir, taken with or without dasabuvir\na combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir\na combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir\na combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir\nribavarin\n\nFor more information on a particular drug, see the NICE guidelines on\u00a0treating chronic hepatitis C\nHow effective is treatment?\nThe new medications now available cure more than 95% of all infections, across all genotypes and levels of disease progression.\nIf the virus is successfully cleared with treatment, it's important to be aware that you're not immune to the infection. This means, for example, that you could become infected again if you continue to inject drugs after treatment.\nIf treatment doesn't work, it may be repeated, extended or tried using a different combination of medicines.\nSide effects of treatment\nTreatments with direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have very few side effects. Most people find DAA tablets very easy to take.\nYou may feel a little sick and have trouble sleeping to begin with, but this should soon settle down.\nYour nurse or doctor should be able to suggest things to help ease any discomfort.\nYou need to complete the full course of treatment to ensure you clear the hepatitis C virus from your body.\nIf you have any problems with your medicines, speak to your doctor or nurse straight away.\nSide effects for each type of treatment can vary from person to person.\nFor a very small number of people, more severe side effects from hepatitis C treatments may include:\n\ndepression\nskin irritation\nanxiety\nproblems sleeping (insomnia)\nanorexia\ntiredness caused by anaemia\nhair loss\naggressive behaviour\n\nHepatitis C medications may have unpredictable reactions when taken with other medicines or remedies. Always check with your specialist, GP or pharmacist before taking other types of medication.\nAny side effects may improve with time as your body gets used to the medications. Tell your care team if any side effect is becoming particularly troublesome.\nTreatment during pregnancy\nThe medications used to treat hepatitis C, particularly ribavirin, can be harmful to unborn babies and aren't normally used during pregnancy.\nIf you're pregnant when diagnosed with the infection, treatment will usually be delayed until you have given birth. Otherwise, you'll be advised to use contraception throughout your treatment and you may need to have regular pregnancy tests.\nIf you're a man taking ribavirin, you shouldn't have sex with a pregnant women unless you use a condom. If your partner isn't pregnant, you should ensure contraception is used during the course of your treatment and your partner may need to have regular pregnancy tests.\nDeciding against treatment\nSome people with chronic hepatitis C decide against treatment. This may be because they:\n\ndon't have any symptoms\nare willing to live with the risk of cirrhosis at a later date\ndon't feel the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the side effects treatment can cause\n\nYour care team can give you advice about this, but the final decision about treatment will be yours.\nIf you decide not to have treatment but then change your mind, you can ask to be treated at any point.\n\n\nIf left untreated, hepatitis C can sometimes cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). This can develop up to 20 years or more after you first become infected.\nA number of things can increase your risk of getting cirrhosis, including:\n\ndrinking alcohol\nhaving type 2 diabetes\ngetting hepatitis C at an older age\nhaving HIV or another type of hepatitis, such as hepatitis B\n\nOverall, up to one in every three people infected with hepatitis C will develop cirrhosis within 20 to 30 years. Some of these will then go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.\nCirrhosis\nIf you have cirrhosis, the scarred tissue in your liver gradually replaces healthy tissue and prevents the liver from working properly.\nThere are usually few symptoms in the early stages. But as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you may experience:\n\ntiredness and weakness\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\nfeeling sick\nvery itchy skin\ntenderness or pain in your tummy\ntiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin\nyellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n\nOther than a liver transplant, there's no cure for cirrhosis. However, lifestyle measures and hepatitis C medications can help stop the condition getting worse.\nRead more about treating cirrhosis.\nLiver failure\nIn severe cases of cirrhosis, the liver loses most or all of its functions. This is known as liver failure or end stage liver disease however this is becoming rarer due to more people taking advantage of the new DAA treatments.\u00a0\nSymptoms of liver failure include:\n\nhair loss\nbuild-up of fluid in the legs, ankles and feet (oedema)\nbuild-up of fluid in your tummy (ascites)\ndark urine\nblack, tarry stools or very pale stools\nfrequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums\na tendency to bruise easily\nvomiting blood\n\nIt's usually possible to live with liver failure for several years by taking medication. However, a liver transplant is currently the only way to cure the condition.\nLiver cancer\nIt's estimated that around 1 in every 20 people with hepatitis-associated cirrhosis will develop liver cancer each year.\nSymptoms of liver cancer can include:\n\nloss of appetite\nunexplained weight loss\ntiredness\nfeeling and being sick\u00a0pain or swelling in your tummy\njaundice\n\nUnfortunately, it's not usually possible to cure liver cancer, especially in people with cirrhosis, although treatment can help control your symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer.\nRead more about treating liver cancer.\n\n\nCould anything I do make hepatitis C worse?\nDrinking alcohol can increase the damage to your liver. If you have hepatitis C, you should try to cut out alcohol or limit your intake. If you need advice about this, ask your doctor or contact an alcohol self-help organisation.\nRead some tips on cutting down your alcohol intake.\nIf you're concerned that you're addicted to alcohol and are unable to stop drinking, contact your GP. Treatments are available to help you quit.\nRead more about treating alcohol misuse.\nIs there anything else I can do to help myself?\nAs well as cutting out alcohol, it can help to:\n\ncontrol your weight with a healthy diet and regular exercise\nstop smoking\nget vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B\n\nThis is because being overweight, smoking and having more than one type of hepatitis can increase the chances of your liver being damaged if you have hepatitis C.\nDo I need a special diet?\nYou won't usually need to change to a special diet if you have hepatitis C, but you will need to make sure you have a generally healthy, balanced diet.\nYour diet should include plenty of fruit and vegetables, starchy foods, fibre and protein. Cut down on fatty, fried and processed food. Read more about what a balanced diet means.\nIf your liver is badly damaged, however, your doctor may suggest limiting your intake of salt and protein to avoid putting too much strain on your liver. A hospital dietitian can advise you on what you can and cannot eat.\nHow can I avoid spreading the infection to others?\nYou can reduce the risk of passing hepatitis C on to other people by:\n\nkeeping personal items, such as toothbrushes or razors, for your own use\ncleaning and covering any cuts or grazes with a waterproof dressing\ncleaning any blood from surfaces with household bleach\nnot sharing needles or syringes with others\nnot donating blood\n\nThe risk of spreading hepatitis C through sex is low. However, the risk is increased if there is blood present, such as menstrual blood or during anal sex.\nCondoms aren't usually necessary for long-term heterosexual couples, but it's a good idea to use them when having anal sex or sex with a new partner.\nDo I have to tell my boss?\nYou don't have to tell your boss that you have hepatitis C, unless you're a healthcare worker.\nHowever, if hepatitis C is affecting your performance at work and your employer knows about your condition, they may be obliged to make allowances for you, such as giving you leave of absence for going to the clinic. You may also be entitled to statutory sick pay to cover doctor appointments or time off work.\nTherefore, you may want to consider telling your boss about your condition.\nCan I travel abroad?\nYou can travel abroad if you have hepatitis C, but you should speak to your doctor in advance.\nYou may need to have vaccinations and special arrangements may need to be made to ensure you're able to transport and store your hepatitis C medication safely.\nIt might also be a good idea to take any documentation, such as details of blood tests or medical records, in case you need medical treatment abroad.\nCan I have a baby if my partner or I have hepatitis C?\nYou can have a baby if you or your partner has hepatitis C, but there's a small risk (around 1 in 20) of hepatitis C passing from mother to baby.\nThere's also a small risk of the infection spreading to the unaffected partner when having unprotected sex, but this is very unlikely to happen.\nSpeak to your doctor for advice if you're planning to have a baby and you or your partner has hepatitis C.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "A hiatus hernia, or hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (\"hiatus\") in the diaphragm.\nThe diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle\u00a0between the chest\u00a0and the abdomen (tummy).\nHiatus hernia and heartburn\nA hiatus hernia itself rarely\u00a0has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called\u00a0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\nGORD is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly.\nYour oesophagus can become\u00a0severely irritated, because it's not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour\u00a0taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems (dysphagia).\nYou should see your GP if you have frequent and severe symptoms of GORD.\nWhat causes a hiatus hernia?\nIt's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen.\nHiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn't develop properly.\nWho's affected\nHiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it's more common in people who are:\n\nover 50 years of age\noverweight\npregnant\n\nIt's estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia.\nThere's also a\u00a0rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which\u00a0is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm. Congenital means that it is present from birth.\nTypes of hiatus hernia\nThere are 2\u00a0main types of hiatus hernia. They are:\n\nsliding hiatus hernias \u2013 hernias that\u00a0move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatus hernias are of this type)\npara-oesophageal hiatus hernias \u2013 also called rolling hiatus hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus (about 5-15% of hiatus hernias are of this type)\n\nThese pages\u00a0mainly focus on sliding hiatus hernias. They can usually be diagnosed using an\u00a0X-ray or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body.\nRead more about diagnosing a hiatus hernia.\nTreating a hiatus hernia\nTreatment for a sliding hiatus hernia\u00a0usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of GORD, such as heartburn.\nLifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. Surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven't worked.\nLifestyle advice\u00a0may include:\n\neating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than 3\u00a0large meals a day\navoiding lying down (including going to bed) for 3\u00a0hours after eating or drinking\nremoving any foods or drinks\u00a0from your diet\u00a0that make your symptoms worse \u00a0\n\nIf a hiatus hernia isn't causing any noticeable problems, it doesn't usually need to be treated.\nSurgery is used to repair a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia if there's a\u00a0risk of serious complications.\nRead more about treating a hiatus hernia.\nFurther problems\nIt's rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications,\u00a0but long-term damage\u00a0to the oesophagus\u00a0caused by\u00a0leaking stomach acid can lead to\u00a0ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus,\u00a0which can increase your risk of oesophageal cancer.\nRead more about the complications of a hiatus hernia.\n\n\nA hiatus hernia can usually be diagnosed after a gastroscopy or X-ray.\nGastroscopy\nA\u00a0gastroscopy\u00a0is a procedure where the\u00a0inside of your body is examined using a gastroscope\u00a0(a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end), which sends images to an external monitor.\nThe gastroscope will be inserted into your mouth and down your throat, and will be used to help identify any problems. The procedure may be carried out using a local anaesthetic or a sedative to help you relax.\nBarium meal X-ray\nThe barium meal\u00a0X-ray, also called the barium swallow test, is an effective way of\u00a0identifying a hiatus hernia.\nAs part of the test, you'll be asked to drink some barium solution. Barium is a non-toxic chemical\u00a0that shows up clearly on an\u00a0X-ray. Once the barium moves down into your digestive system, a series of X-rays will be taken to identify any problems.\nIf you need to have a barium meal X-ray, you won't be able to eat or drink anything for at least 6\u00a0hours before the procedure, so that your stomach and duodenum (the top of the small intestine) are empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.\nYou'll be given a white, chalky liquid containing barium to drink while lying down. This will allow the specialist to see your stomach on an X-ray monitor more easily, as well as any ulcers or abnormal growths. Your\u00a0bed may be tipped slightly during the test, so that the barium fills all the areas of your stomach.\nA barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes to perform. Afterwards, you'll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system.\nYou may feel slightly sick after a barium meal X-ray and the barium may cause constipation. Your stools may also be white for a few days afterwards, as the barium passes through your system.\n\n\nTreatment for a hiatus hernia is usually only necessary if it's causing problems.\nIn most cases, people with a hiatus hernia only experience problems if the hernia causes\u00a0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD can cause symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in your mouth.\nLifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments, although surgery may be used as an alternative to long-term medication, or if other treatments are ineffective.\nLifestyle changes\nThere are several things you can do yourself to help relieve\u00a0symptoms of GORD caused by a hiatus hernia. These include:\n\neating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day\navoiding lying down (including going to bed) for at least 3\u00a0hours after\u00a0eating or drinking\navoiding drinking during the night\nremoving certain\u00a0foods\u00a0from your diet if you think they make your symptoms worse\navoiding alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, tomatoes, fatty foods, spicy foods and acidic food\u00a0or drinks, such as citrus fruit juice, if they make your symptoms worse\navoiding bending over or stooping, particularly after eating or drinking\nraising the head of your bed by around 20cm (8 inches) by placing a piece of wood or blocks under it; don't use extra pillows, because this may increase pressure on your abdomen\n\nIf you're overweight,\u00a0losing weight may help to reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms.\nIf you smoke, you should try to give up. Tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse.\nRead about\u00a0stopping smoking.\nMedication\nA number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of hiatus hernia. These are described below.\nAntacid medicines\u00a0can relieve some of the symptoms of hiatus hernia.\u00a0They come in liquid or tablet form and\u00a0can be swallowed or chewed. They help to neutralise\u00a0stomach acid when they reach the oesophagus and stomach by making it less acidic.\nHowever, antacid medicines don't work for everyone. They're not a long-term solution if symptoms persist or you're in extreme discomfort.\nAntacids shouldn't be taken at the same time as other medicines, because they can stop other medicines from being properly absorbed\u00a0by your body. They may also damage the special coating on some types of tablets. Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice.\nAlginates are an alternative medicine to antacids. They work by producing a protective coating that shields the lining of your stomach and oesophagus from the effects of stomach acid.\nIn some cases,\u00a0a medicine known as an H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) may be recommended if a hiatus hernia is causing GORD. Examples of H2RAs include cimetidine,\u00a0famotidine (PepcidTwo) and ranitidine.\nH2RAs block the effects of the chemical histamine, which\u00a0your body\u00a0uses to produce stomach acid. H2RAs therefore help to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach.\nSide effects of H2RAs are uncommon. However, possible side effects may include diarrhoea, headaches, tiredness\u00a0and a\u00a0rash.\nSome H2RAs are available over the counter at pharmacies. These types of HR2As are taken in a lower dosage than the ones available on prescription. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you're not sure\u00a0whether these medicines are suitable for you.\nYour GP may prescribe a medication called a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach. Examples of the\u00a0PPIs you may be prescribed include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole.\nMost people tolerate PPIs well and side effects are uncommon. When they do occur, they're usually mild and can include headaches, diarrhoea, feeling sick or constipation.\nTo minimise any side effects, your GP will prescribe the lowest possible dose of PPIs they think will be effective. You should let your GP know if the prescribed dose of PPIs doesn't work. A stronger dose may be needed.\u00a0\nSurgery\nSurgery is usually only recommended for a sliding hiatus hernia (hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area)\u00a0if the problem fails to respond to lifestyle changes and medication.\nYou may also want to consider surgery if you have persistent and troublesome symptoms, but don't want to take medication on a long-term basis.\nPrior to surgery, you may need further investigations to check how well the oesophagus moves (manometry) and\u00a0how much acid is being refluxed (24-hour oesopageal pH studies).\nA procedure called a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (LNF) is one of the most common surgical techniques used to treat GORD and sliding hiatus hernias.\nLNF is a type of keyhole surgery that involves making a series of small cuts in your abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas is used to inflate your abdomen to give the surgeon room to work in.\nDuring LNF,\u00a0the stomach is put back into the correct position and the diaphragm around the lower part of the oesophagus is tightened. This should prevent any acid moving back out of your stomach.\nLNF is carried out under general anaesthetic,\u00a0so you won't feel any pain or discomfort. The surgery takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete.\nAfter having LNF, you should be able to leave hospital after you've recovered from the effects of the general anaesthetic. This is usually within 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days. Depending on the type of job you do, you should be able to return to work within 3\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks.\nFor the first 6\u00a0weeks after surgery, it's recommended that you only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Avoid eating hard food that could get stuck at the site of the surgery, such as toast, chicken or steak.\nCommon side effects of LNF include difficulties swallowing (dysphagia), belching, bloating and flatulence.\nThese side effects should resolve over the course of a few months. However, in about 1 in 100 cases they can be persistent. In such circumstances, further corrective surgery may be required.\nIf you have a\u00a0para-oesophageal hiatus hernia, where the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus, surgery may be recommended to reduce the risk of the hernia becoming strangulated (see complications of a hiatus hernia for more information).\n\n\nComplications\u00a0from a hiatus hernia are rare, but they can be serious.\nHiatus hernias that slide in and out of the chest area (sliding hiatus hernias) can cause\u00a0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). This is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (gullet). This can damage the oesophagus, increasing the risk of the problems described below.\nOesophageal ulcers\nDamage to the lining of the\u00a0oesophagus (oesophagitis) caused by stomach acid can lead to the formation of ulcers. The ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making swallowing difficult.\nUlcers can usually be successfully treated by controlling the underlying symptoms of GORD. In most cases, over-the-counter medicines called antacids\u00a0or alginates are used to treat the condition.\nRead more about treating GORD.\nOesophageal stricture\nRepeated damage to the lining of your oesophagus can lead to the formation of scar tissue. If the scar tissue is allowed to build up, it can cause your oesophagus to become narrowed. This is known as oesophageal stricture.\nAn oesophageal stricture can make swallowing food difficult and painful. Oesophageal strictures can be treated using a tiny balloon to dilate (widen) the oesophagus. This procedure is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic.\nBarrett's oesophagus and cancer\nRepeated damage to the oesophagus can also lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barrett's oesophagus.\nBarrett's oesophagus doesn't usually cause noticeable symptoms, other than those associated with GORD. However, Barrett's oesophagus can increase\u00a0your risk of developing oesophageal cancer.\nIf you have persistent reflux symptoms for more than 3\u00a0weeks, you should talk to your GP because you may need some investigations.\nStrangulated hernia\nIn some cases, a hiatus hernia causes part of the stomach to push up next to the oesophagus. This is known as a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia. GORD doesn't usually occur in these cases, but there's a risk of the hernia becoming strangulated.\nStrangulation occurs when the hernia becomes knotted and the blood supply to the area is cut off. Emergency surgery is usually required to correct the problem.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid. It's vital for the normal functioning of the body. Cell membranes, hormones and vitamin D are created by your body using cholesterol.\nThere are 2 main sources of the cholesterol in your blood:\n\ncholesterol in the food you eat\ncholesterol produced by your liver\n\nHaving an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health.\nHigh cholesterol, on its own, doesn't usually cause any symptoms but increases your risk of serious health conditions.\nAbout cholesterol\nCholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoprotein.\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver. From there it's either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product. For this reason, HDL is referred to as \"good cholesterol\" and higher levels are better.\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol to the cells that need it. If there's too much cholesterol for the cells to use it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries. For this reason, LDL is known as \"bad cholesterol\".\nThe amount of cholesterol in the blood, both HDL and LDL , is measured with a blood test.\nThe recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease.\nWhy should I lower my cholesterol?\nEvidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of:\n\nnarrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)\nheart attack\nstroke\ntransient ischaemic attack (TIA) \u2013 often known as a \"mini stroke\"\nperipheral arterial disease (PAD)\n\nThis is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body.\nYour risk of developing coronary heart disease also rises as your blood's cholesterol level increases. This can cause pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity (angina).\nWhat causes high cholesterol?\nMany factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol.\nThese include:\n\nan unhealthy diet \u2013 in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat\nsmoking \u2013 a chemical called acrolin, found in cigarettes, stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)\nhaving diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension)\nhaving a family history of stroke or heart disease\n\nThere's also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia. This can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily.\nRead more about the causes of high cholesterol\nWhen should my cholesterol levels be tested?\nYour GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you:\n\nhave been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\nhave a family history of early cardiovascular disease\nhave a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition\nare overweight\nhave high blood pressure, diabetes or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels\n\nRead more about how cholesterol is tested\nWhat should my cholesterol levels be?\nBlood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol/L.\nAs a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be:\n\n5mmol/L or less for healthy adults\n4mmol/L or less for those at high risk\n\nAs a general guide, LDL levels should be:\n\n3mmol/L or less for healthy adults\n2mmol/L or less for those at high risk\n\nAn ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease.\nYour ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease.\nCholesterol is only one risk factor. The level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present.\nHow can I lower my cholesterol level?\nThe first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. It's important to keep your diet low in fatty food.\nYou can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help prevent high cholesterol from returning.\nOther lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise and giving up smoking, can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol.\nIf these measures don't reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins.\nYour GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins. The benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks.\nRead more about how high cholesterol is treated\n\n\nMany different factors can contribute to high blood cholesterol, including lifestyle factors like smoking, an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, as well as having an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.\nLifestyle\nYour lifestyle can increase your risk of developing high blood cholesterol.\nThis includes:\n\nan unhealthy diet \u2013 some foods, such as liver, kidneys and eggs, contain cholesterol (dietary cholesterol), but\u00a0this has little effect on blood cholesterol: it's the total amount of saturated fat in your diet that's more important to watch; read more about preventing high cholesterol\nlack of exercise or physical activity \u2013 this can increase your level of \"bad cholesterol\" (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL)\nobesity\u00a0\u2013\u00a0if you're overweight, it's likely that you'll have higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and a lower level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\ndrinking\u00a0excessive amounts of alcohol\u00a0\u2013 regularly drinking large amounts\u00a0of alcohol can increase your cholesterol and triglyceride levels\nsmoking\u00a0\u2013 a chemical in cigarettes called acrolein stops \"good cholesterol\" (HDL) transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)\n\nUnderlying conditions\nPeople with high blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes often have high cholesterol.\nSome other health conditions that can also cause raised levels of cholesterol include:\n\nkidney disease\nliver disease\nan underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\n\nTreating the underlying condition can help to reduce cholesterol.\u00a0\nOther factors\nThere are a number of factors associated with high cholesterol that can't be changed that increase your risk of having a\u00a0heart attack or stroke. Doctors refer to these as \"fixed factors\".\nThey include:\n\nfamily history of early coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke \u2013 you're more likely to have high cholesterol if you have a close male relative (father or brother) aged under 55, or a female relative (mother or sister) aged under 65, who's had CHD or stroke\na family history of a cholesterol-related condition \u2013 for example, having a parent, brother or sister with familial hypercholesterolaemia\nage \u2013 the older you are, the greater the likelihood of your arteries narrowing (atherosclerosis)\nethnic group \u2013 people of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan descent are at increased risk of having a heart attack\nsex \u2013 males are more likely to have heart attacks than females\n\nIf you have a fixed risk factor, or several fixed risk factors, it's even more important to look at your lifestyle and any underlying conditions you may have.\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is the medical term for high cholesterol that runs in families. It's caused by a gene alteration inherited from a parent, rather than an unhealthy lifestyle.\nPeople with familial hypercholesterolaemia have raised cholesterol from birth, which can lead to the early development of heart problems, such as atherosclerosis and CHD.\nIn the UK, familial hypercholesterolaemia is thought to affect about 1 in 500 people, which means approximately 120,000 people are thought to be affected.\nThere's a\u00a0one in two (50%) chance that a child or\u00a0brother or sister of someone with familial hypercholesterolaemia will also have the condition.\nRead more about the importance of\u00a0early identification and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia\n\n\nBlood cholesterol levels are measured with a simple blood test.\nGetting a cholesterol test\nA blood sample is taken that will be used to determine the amount of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL), good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) and\u00a0other fatty substances (triglycerides) in your blood.\nYou may be asked not to eat for 10-12 hours before the cholesterol test, usually including when you're asleep at night. This ensures that all food is completely digested and won't affect the outcome of the test.\nYour GP or practice nurse can carry out the\u00a0cholesterol test and will take a blood sample, either using a needle and a syringe or by pricking your finger.\nA newer type of test that measures non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) is now sometimes used because it's thought to be a more accurate way of estimating\u00a0cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than LDL.\nNon-HDL cholesterol is total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol. It's also not necessary to fast before the test, so it\u00a0is more convenient.\nWho should be tested?\nYour GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you:\n\nhave been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini-stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\nare over the age of 40\u00a0\u2013\u00a0people over 40 should have their estimate of CVD risk reviewed regularly\nhave a family history of early cardiovascular disease\u00a0\u2013 for example, if your father or brother developed heart disease or had a heart attack or stroke before the age of 55, or if your mother or sister had these conditions before the age of 65\nhave a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition, such as familial hypercholesterolaemia\nare overweight or obese\nhave high blood pressure or diabetes\nhave another medical condition, such as kidney disease, an underactive thyroid, or an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis)\u00a0\u2013 these conditions can cause increased levels of cholesterol or triglycerides\n\nResults\nAfter your cholesterol test, your GP or nurse will explain your results and calculate whether you have a high, moderate or low risk of developing heart disease or stroke (cardiovascular disease)\u00a0within the next 10 years.\nHowever, this risk isn't just based on your cholesterol reading. It also takes into account:\n\nyour\u00a0BMI (body mass index)\u00a0\u2013 which measures your weight in relation to your height\ntreatable risk factors\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes\u00a0and other medical conditions\nyour age, sex, family history and ethnicity\n\nBased on your results, your GP or nurse will recommend steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing CVD.\nThis may include advice about making lifestyle changes, such as eating more healthily\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, for example\u00a0\u2013 and doing more exercise.\nCholesterol-lowering medication, such as statins, may also be recommended.\nRead more about treating high cholesterol\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia\nPeople with familial hypercholesterolaemia, or inherited high cholesterol, are at increased risk of developing CVD.\nIn the UK, most of the 120,000 people thought to have the condition are undiagnosed and untreated.\nAs a result of the increased risk of developing CVD, it's very important that those with familial hypercholesterolaemia are diagnosed as early as possible and offered appropriate treatment.\nThe\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that adults with a total cholesterol level of above 7.5mmol/l before treatment should be assessed for\u00a0familial hypercholesterolaemia.\nIf you've been diagnosed with\u00a0familial hypercholesterolaemia, you'll be referred for a specialist assessment, which may include DNA testing to confirm the diagnosis.\nAppropriate treatment will be recommended and other members of your family who may be affected will also be tested.\nYou'll be closely monitored, and should have a full review at least once a year to check how well your treatment is working and assess any symptoms you may have.\nChildren at risk of\u00a0familial hypercholesterolaemia will be tested by the time they reach\u00a010 years of age.\nThis is because any signs of CVD, such as thickening of the carotid artery wall, will be identifiable by this age.\nThe assessment will be carried out by a specialist with expertise in familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and young people.\nEarly diagnosis of\u00a0familial hypercholesterolaemia means it's possible to recommend lifestyle changes and other appropriate treatments to reduce the long-term problems associated with high cholesterol and improve long-term health.\nFor further information, see the\u00a0NICE guidance about familial hypercholesterolaemia\n\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you'll be advised to make changes to your diet and increase your level of exercise.\nAfter a few months, if your cholesterol level hasn't dropped, you may be advised to take cholesterol-lowering medication.\nChanging your diet,\u00a0stopping smoking and exercising more\u00a0will also help to prevent high cholesterol developing.\nThe various treatments for high cholesterol are outlined below.\u00a0\nDiet\nEating a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet that's low in\u00a0saturated fats can reduce your level of \"bad cholesterol\" (LDL).\nTry to avoid or cut down on the following foods, which are high in saturated fat:\n\nfatty cuts of meat and meat products, such as sausages and pies\nbutter, ghee and lard\ncream, soured cream,\u00a0cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and ice cream\ncheese, particularly hard cheese\ncakes and biscuits\nmilk chocolate\ncoconut oil, coconut cream and palm oil\n\nThe government recommends that a maximum of 11% of a person's food energy should come from saturated fat. This equates to no more than:\n\n30g of saturated fat a day for the average man\n20g\u00a0of saturated fat a day\u00a0for the average\u00a0woman\n\nChildren should have less.\nCheck the labels on the foods you're eating to find out how much saturated fat you're consuming.\nOmega-3 fatty acids\nMany experts believe that the fats found in avocados and\u00a0oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon and tuna, are good for you.\nThese are known as omega-3 fatty acids and high doses can improve (lower) triglyceride levels in some people. However, too much omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to obesity.\nFor people with a high triglyceride level, at least two portions of oily fish a week is thought to be beneficial. However, there's no evidence that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements has the same benefit.\nCholesterol-lowering medication\nThere are several different types of cholesterol-lowering medication that work in different ways. Your GP can advise you about the most suitable type of treatment, and may also prescribe medication to lower high blood pressure (hypertension) if it affects you.\nThe most commonly prescribed medications are outlined below.\nStatins block the enzyme (a type of chemical) in your liver that helps to make cholesterol. This leads to a reduction in your blood cholesterol level.\nYou'll usually be started on a medication called atorvastatin. Other statins include simvastatin and rosuvastatin.\nWhen someone has side effects from using a statin, it's described as having an \"intolerance\" to it. Side effects of statins include headaches, muscle pain and stomach problems, such as indigestion,\u00a0diarrhoea or constipation.\nStatins will only be prescribed to people who continue to be at high risk of heart disease, because they need to be taken for life.\u00a0Cholesterol levels start to rise again once you stop taking them.\nIn some cases, a low daily dose of\u00a0aspirin may be prescribed, depending on your age (usually over 40 years old) and other risk factors.\nLow-dose aspirin can help to prevent\u00a0blood clots forming, particularly for someone who's had a\u00a0heart attack, has established vascular disease, or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nYou may also be advised to have periodic blood tests to ensure your liver is functioning well.\nEzetimibe is a medication that blocks the absorption of cholesterol from food and bile juices in your intestines into your blood. It's generally not as effective as statins, but is less likely to cause side effects.\nYou can take ezetimibe at the same time as your usual statin if your cholesterol levels aren't low enough with the statin alone. The side effects of this combination are generally the same as those of the statin on its own (muscle pain and stomach problems).\nYou can take ezetimibe by itself if you're unable to take a statin. This may be because you have another medical condition, you take medication that interferes with how the statin works, or because you experience side effects from statins. Ezetimibe taken on its own rarely causes side effects.\nFor more information, you can read the National Institute for Health & Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines about the use of ezetimibe for treating high cholesterol.\n\n\nYou can lower your cholesterol by eating a healthy, balanced diet that's low in saturated fat, exercising regularly, not smoking and cutting down on alcohol.\nDiet\nIf you have an unhealthy diet that's high in fat, fatty plaques are much more likely to build up in your arteries. This is because fatty foods contain cholesterol.\nThere are two types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. You should avoid foods containing saturated fats, as they will increase the levels of \"bad cholesterol\"\u00a0(low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) in your blood.\nFoods high in saturated fat include:\n\nmeat pies\nsausages and fatty cuts of meat\nbutter\nghee\u00a0\u2013 a type of butter often used in Indian cooking\nlard\ncream\nhard cheese\ncakes and biscuits\nfood that contains coconut or palm oil\n\nHowever, it's not healthy to completely cut out all types of fat from your diet. It's important to replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats\u00a0\u2013 they've been shown to increase levels of \"good cholesterol\" (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) and reduce any blockage in your arteries.\nFoods that are high in unsaturated fat include:\n\noily fish\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as mackerel, salmon and tuna\navocados\nnuts and seeds\nsunflower, rapeseed and olive oil\n\nA low-fat diet including lots of fibre, such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta, and plenty of fruit and vegetables has also been shown to help lower cholesterol.\nFruit and vegetables\u00a0are full of vitamins, minerals and fibre, and help keep your body in good condition. Aim to eat\u00a0five 80g portions of fruit and vegetables every day.\nSmoking\nA chemical found in cigarettes called acrolein stops HDL transporting fatty deposits to the liver, leading to high cholesterol and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). This means\u00a0smoking is a major risk factor for both\u00a0heart attacks and strokes.\nIf you decide to stop smoking,\u00a0your GP can refer you to an NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will provide you with dedicated help and advice about the best ways to give up smoking.\nYou can also call Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0on 0800 84 84 84. The specially trained helpline staff can offer you free expert advice and encouragement.\nIf you're committed to giving up smoking but don't want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may experience after giving up.\nRead more about treatment for quitting smoking\nExercise\nBeing active and\u00a0exercising regularly will increase the levels of HDL in your body by stimulating the body to move fatty deposits to the liver, so they can be broken down.\nExercise will also help you maintain a healthy weight, and\u00a0lose weight if you're overweight.\u00a0Being overweight can increase the amount of \"bad cholesterol\" in your blood.\nAnother benefit of regular physical activity is it will help lower your blood pressure by keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.\nDoing 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week is recommended to help lower your cholesterol. Walking,\u00a0swimming and\u00a0cycling are good examples of this type of exercise.\nRead more about the recommended physical activity guidelines\u00a0for adults (aged 19-64) and the physical activity\u00a0guidelines\u00a0for older adults (aged 65 and over)\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "HIV is a long term health condition which is now very easy to manage. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus targets the immune system and if untreated, weakens your ability to fight infections and disease.\nNowadays, HIV treatment can stop the virus spreading and if used early enough, can reverse damage to the immune system.\nHIV is most commonly transmitted through having unprotected sex with someone with HIV who isn't taking HIV treatment. Unprotected sex means having sex without taking HIV PrEP or using condoms.\nHIV can also be transmitted by:\n\nsharing infected needles and other injecting equipment\nan HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding\n\nAll pregnant women are offered an HIV test and if the virus is found, they can be offered treatment which virtually eliminates risk to their child during pregnancy and birth.\nPeople who take HIV treatment and whose virus level is undetectable can't pass HIV on to others. Although there is no cure for HIV yet, people living with HIV who take their treatment should have normal lifespans and live in good health.\nWithout treatment, people with HIV will eventually become unwell. HIV can be fatal if it's not detected and treated in time to allow the immune system to repair. It's extremely important to test for HIV if you think you've been exposed.\nHow do you get HIV?\nHIV is found in body fluids of a person with the virus, whose levels of virus are detectable.\nThe body fluids most likely to contain enough virus to pass on HIV to another person are:\n\nsemen (including pre-cum)\nvaginal fluid\nanal mucus\nblood\nbreast milk\n\nHIV is a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long.\nHIV is most commonly passed on through unprotected anal or vaginal sex. There is a very low risk of getting HIV through oral sex and there can be a small risk through sharing sex toys, which can be eliminated by using fresh condoms for each person using the toy.\nRead more about what causes HIV\nHow do I know if I have HIV?\nSeek healthcare advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV.\nThe only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or occasionally saliva for signs of the infection. In NHS services this usually involves a blood test with results available within a few days.\nSome services, including HIV or sexual health charities, may provide saliva tests. Saliva tests that indicate a person may have HIV will need to be confirmed through a blood test.\nIt's important to be aware that:\n\nHIV tests may need to be repeated four weeks after potential exposure to HIV, this is known as the \"window period\", but you shouldn't wait this long to seek help\nyou can get tested in a number of places, including your GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities\nclinic tests can sometimes give you a result in minutes, although it may take a few days to get the result of a more detailed blood test\nhome-testing or home-sampling kits are available to buy or order online or from pharmacies \u2013 depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days\n\nIf the test shows you have HIV, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.\nRead more about diagnosing HIV\nTreating and living with HIV\nTreatments for HIV are now very effective, enabling people with HIV to live long and healthy lives.\nMedication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines usually come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day.\nHIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but taking a combination of different drugs makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of 3 antiretrovirals (although some people take 1 or 2) and it's vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor.\nTaking a number of different drugs doesn\u2019t always mean taking many tablets though as some drugs are combined together into one tablet.\nFor people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is \"undetectable\" in blood tests) will prevent you passing on HIV to sexual partners.\nIt's extremely rare for a pregnant woman living with HIV to transmit it to their babies, provided they receive timely and effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care. An HIV test is routinely offered to all women in Scotland as part of antenatal screening.\nRead more about living with HIV\nPreventing HIV\nIt has never been easier to prevent the transmission of HIV.\nSomeone living with HIV who takes their HIV treatment and who has had an undetectable level of virus for six months, cannot transmit HIV to anyone else. Over 90% of all people diagnosed with HIV in Scotland have undetectable virus. It's therefore extremely rare for someone to get HIV from a person that knows they have the virus.\nPrEP is a form of HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV which will help to prevent them from getting HIV. In Scotland PrEP is available on the NHS through sexual health clinics for people who are at risk of getting HIV. PrEP only provides protection from HIV and not from any other sexually transmitted infections.\nRead further information about HIV PrEP\nProperly used condoms (and lubricant for anal sex) are effective at preventing transmission of HIV as well as other sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.\nHIV\u00a0Post exposure prophylaxis\u00a0(PEP) is a form of emergency\u00a0HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV but\u00a0who has or may have been very recently exposed to HIV.\nPEP should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. The earlier it is taken the more effective it is.\nUsing fresh injecting equipment, including any needles, syringes, swabs and spoons and avoiding sharing will eliminate any risk of HIV.\nHow common is HIV?\nAt the end of December 2019, there were 326 reports of HIV diagnoses in Scotland. Of these, 167 were first-ever HIV diagnoses and 158 had been previously diagnosed outwith Scotland, but were newly reported in Scotland during 2019. It's estimated that there are 6,122 individuals living with HIV in Scotland and of these 92% have been diagnosed. A total of 5,074 are attending specialist HIV treatment and care services. Of these, 98% are receiving antiretroviral therapy with 95% achieving an undetectable viral load.\nThe three groups with highest rates of HIV are:\n\ngay and bisexual men or other men who have sex with men\npeople from countries with high HIV prevalence, especially sub Saharan African countries\npeople who share injecting equipment (including needles, syringes, spoons and swabs) or who have sex with people who inject drugs\n\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that around 36.9 million people in the world are living with HIV.\n\n\nPeople who are infected with HIV, often experience a short flu like illness that occurs 2 to 6 weeks after infection. This is known as primary HIV infection.\nThe most common symptoms are:\n\nfever (raised temperature)\nsore throat\nbody rash\n\nOther symptoms can include:\n\ntiredness\njoint pain\nmuscle pain\nswollen glands (nodes)\n\nHowever, these symptoms are most commonly caused by conditions other than HIV, and do not mean you have the virus.\nIf you have several of these symptoms, and you think you have been at risk of HIV infection within the past few weeks, you should get an HIV test.\nAfter the initial symptoms disappear, HIV may often not cause any further symptoms for many years. During this time, HIV continues to be active and causes progressive damage to your immune system.\nOnce the immune system becomes severely damaged symptoms can include:\n\nweight loss\nchronic diarrhoea\nnight sweats\nskin problems\nrecurrent infections\nserious life-threatening illnesses\n\nEarlier diagnosis and treatment of HIV can prevent these problems occurring and reverse them.\nRead more about treating HIV\nIt is recommended you should still take an HIV test if you have put yourself at risk at any time in the past, even if you experience no symptoms.\nWant to know more?\n\nTerrence Higgins Trust: Stages of HIV infection\nnam aidsmap: HIV and AIDS\n\n\n\nRoutes of HIV transmission\nIn Scotland, HIV is most commonly transmitted by having sex with someone who has HIV without using any form of protection, such as HIV PrEP or condoms.\nA person with HIV can only pass the virus to others if they have a detectable level of virus. People living with HIV who are taking treatment and have undetectable levels of virus in their bodies can't transmit HIV to others.\nOver 90% of people living with HIV in Scotland have undetectable levels of virus.\nThe main routes of transmission are unprotected receptive or insertive vaginal and anal sex. The risk of transmitting HIV through oral sex is extremely low.\nOther ways of getting HIV include:\n\nsharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment\nfrom mother to baby before or during birth when the mother isn't taking HIV medication\nfrom mother to baby by breastfeeding when the mother isn't taking HIV medication\nsharing sex toys with someone infected with HIV and who isn't taking HIV medication (or by not using a fresh condom on sex toys for each person using it)\nblood transfusion (outside of the UK)\n\nHow is HIV transmitted?\nHIV is not passed on easily from one person to another. The virus does not spread through the air like cold and flu viruses.\nHIV lives in the blood and in some body fluids. To get HIV, one of these fluids from someone with HIV (who has detectable levels of virus in their body) has to get into your blood.\nThe body fluids that contain enough HIV to infect someone are:\n\nsemen (including precum)\nvaginal fluids, including menstrual blood\nbreast milk\nblood\nlining inside the anus\n\nOther body fluids like saliva, sweat or urine do not contain enough of the virus to infect another person.\nThe main ways the virus enters the bloodstream are:\n\nby injecting into the bloodstream with a contaminated needle or injecting equipment\nthrough the thin lining on or inside the anus and genitals\nvia cuts and sores in the skin\n\nHIV is not passed on through:\n\nkissing\nspitting\nbeing bitten\ncontact with unbroken, healthy skin\nbeing sneezed on\nsharing baths, towels or cutlery\nusing the same toilets or swimming pools\nmouth-to-mouth resuscitation\ncontact with animals or insects such as mosquitoes\n\nWho is most at risk?\nHaving unprotected sex increases the risk of being infected with HIV. Unprotected sex means having sex where you are not taking HIV PrEP or using condoms. People who are at higher risk of becoming infected with HIV include people who are not taking PrEP medication and who are:\n\nmen who have had unprotected anal sex with men\nwomen who have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men\npeople who have had unprotected sex with a person who has lived or travelled in a high HIV prevalence country\npeople who inject drugs\npeople who have had unprotected sex with somebody who has injected drugs\npeople who have caught another sexually transmitted infection\npeople who have received a blood transfusion while in Africa, eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, Asia or central and southern America\n\n\n\nThe only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test, as symptoms of HIV may not appear for many years.\nHIV testing is provided to anyone free of charge on the NHS. Many clinics can give you the result on the same next day and home-testing and home-sampling kits are also available. Home-testing and home sampling kits are also available from some services and charities or to buy online.\nWho should get tested for HIV?\nAnyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested.\nCertain groups of people are at particularly high risk and are advised to have regular tests. For example:\n\ngay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men are advised to have an HIV test at least once a year, or every 3 months, if having sex without HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners\nwomen and men from countries with high HIV prevalence, especially from sub Saharan Africa are advised to have an HIV test, if having sex without using HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners\npeople who inject drugs or who have sex without using HIV PrEP and condoms with people who inject drugs\n\nRead more about how you get HIV\nWhen should I get tested for HIV?\nSeek health care advice immediately if you think there's a chance you could have HIV. The earlier it's diagnosed, the earlier you can start treatment and avoid becoming ill.\nSome HIV tests may need to be repeated four weeks after exposure to HIV infection, but you shouldn't wait this long to seek help.\nWhere can I get an HIV test?\nThere are various places you can go to for an HIV test, including:\n\nsexual health clinics\nclinics run by charities such as the Terrence Higgins Trust or Waverly Care Scotland\nsome GP surgeries\nlocal drug dependency services\na private clinic, where you will have to pay\n\nAn HIV test is one of the range of tests routinely offered to all women in Scotland as part of antenatal screening. There are also home-sampling and home-testing kits (see below) you can use if you don't want to visit any of these places.\nTypes of HIV tests\nThere are 4 main types of HIV test:\n\nfull blood test \u2013 where a sample of blood is taken in a clinic and sent for testing in a laboratory. Results are usually available within a few days.\n\"point of care\" test \u2013 where a sample of saliva from your mouth or a small spot of blood from your finger is taken in a clinic. This sample doesn't need to be sent to a laboratory and the result is available within a few minutes.\nhome-sampling kit \u2013 where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood at home and send it off in the post for testing. You'll be contacted by phone or text with your result in a few days. You can buy them online or from some pharmacies.\nhome-testing kit \u2013 where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood yourself and test it at home. The result is available within minutes. It's important to check that any test you buy has a CE quality assurance mark and is licensed for sale in the UK, as poor quality HIV self-tests are available from overseas.\n\nIf the test finds no sign of infection, your result is \"negative\". If signs of infection are found, the result is \"positive\".\nThe full blood test is the most accurate test and can normally give reliable results from four weeks after infection. The other tests whilst also accurate, may not give a reliable result for a longer period after exposure to the infection (this is known as the \"window period\").\nFor all these tests, a full blood test should be carried out to confirm the result if the first test is positive. If this test is also positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options.\nYou may be able to book an appointment for an HIV test online using the online booking system. This varies for different NHS board areas.\n\n\nAlthough HIV cannot be cured, it's a very manageable long term condition and effective treatment is available to enable individuals to live a long and healthy life.\nIf you're diagnosed with HIV, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for treatment, regular monitoring and care.\nIt's recommended that everyone diagnosed with HIV starts treatment shortly after being diagnosed to keep in good health and free of symptoms. Treatment for HIV is generally very well tolerated. Medication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines come in the form of tablets which need to be taken every day. HIV can develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but by taking a combination of different drugs or with support from your doctor in taking your treatment, resistance is less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of three antiretrovirals (although some people take 1 or 2) and it's vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor. For people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is \"undetectable\" in blood tests) will prevent you passing on HIV to sexual partners.\nRead more about treating HIV:\n\nTerrence Higgins Trust: Treatment for HIV\nHIV i-Base: Introduction to combination therapy\n\nMissing a dose\nHIV treatment works best if you take your pills regularly every day. You will need to develop a daily routine to fit your treatment plan around your lifestyle.\nSide effects of HIV treatment\nHIV treatment is generally very well tolerated. Your HIV clinic will monitor your health for side effects.\nCommon side effects include:\n\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\nskin rashes\nsleep difficulties\n\nPeople with HIV get treatment at a specialist HIV clinic which is usually part of a sexual health or infectious diseases clinic at your local hospital.\nServices, including support organisations, may work together to provide specialist care and emotional support.\nFind out more about living with HIV\n\n\nThe best ways to prevent HIV are to take PrEP before exposure to HIV, use a condom for sex and to never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs).\nTaking PrEP before you're exposed to HIV means that there's a drug inside of you to block HIV if it gets into your body, so it can't infect you.\nIf you have HIV, it's important to take your HIV medication. If HIV medication makes your viral load undetectable, you won't pass the virus on to anyone else.\nIf you think you may come into contact with HIV, taking anti-HIV medication beforehand will stop you becoming infected.\nRead further information about HIV PrEP\nIf you think you may have been exposed to HIV and you haven't taken PrEP medication or used a condom, you should take PEP medication.\nPost exposure prophylaxis\u00a0(PEP) is a form of emergency\u00a0HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV but\u00a0who has or may have been very recently exposed to HIV.\nPEP should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. The earlier it is taken the more effective it is.\nPEP is available from sexual health services or out of hours from A&E.\nCondoms come in a variety of shapes, colours, textures, materials and flavours. Both male and female condoms are available.\nA condom is the most effective form of protection against HIV and other STIs. It can be used for vaginal and anal sex, and for oral sex performed on men.\nHIV can be passed on before ejaculation, through pre-cum and vaginal secretions, and from the anus.\nIt is very important that condoms are put on before any sexual contact occurs between the penis, vagina, mouth or anus.\nYou can get free condoms in most areas of Scotland, check your local sexual health service website for details.\nLubricant, or lube, is often used to enhance sexual pleasure and safety, by adding moisture to either the vagina or anus during sex.\nLubricant can make sex safer by reducing the risk of anal or vaginal tears caused by dryness or friction, and it can also prevent a condom from tearing. Lubricant for vaginal sex is only recommended for women that have low vaginal moisture.\nOnly water-based lubricant (such as K-Y Jelly) rather than an oil-based lubricant (such as Vaseline or massage and baby oil) should be used with condoms.\nOil-based lubricants weaken the latex in condoms and can cause them to break or tear.\nFind out more about what sexual activities can put you at risk of HIV and other STIs on the Sexual Health Scotland website.\nIf you inject drugs, you shouldn't share needles, syringes or other injecting equipment such as spoons and swabs as this could expose you to HIV and other viruses found in the blood, such as hepatitis C.\nMany local authorities and pharmacies offer needle exchange programmes, where used needles can be exchanged for clean ones.\nA GP or drug counsellor should be able to advise you about free injecting equipment provision including needles.\nIf you are having a tattoo or piercing, it's important that a clean, sterilised needle is always used.\n\n\nHIV is a long term condition which is easy to manage and treat. People living with HIV who are on treatment will live a near normal lifespan in very good health.\nAdjusting to living with HIV can take a while for some people. Your HIV clinic can provide support for you in managing your condition and in adjusting to living with the condition. They will also be able to signpost you to support services provided by HIV support organisations.\nPractical issues you might require support with include psychological support, telling people about your HIV, sex and relationships, pregnancy and financial support.\nYour HIV clinic will provide you with advice and support to help you take your HIV medicine and stay well and healthy.It\u2019s best to tell your HIV doctor or HIV pharmacy about all other drugs \u2013including over-the-counter medications, supplements, and recreational drugs \u2013 you are taking to check they won\u2019t interact with your HIV medication.\nIn addition to taking HIV medication, there are many things you can do to improve your general health and reduce your risk of falling ill.\nThese include:\n\nregular exercise\nhealthy eating\nstopping smoking\nreducing the amount of alcohol you drink\n\nBecause HIV is a long-term condition, you will be in regular contact with your healthcare team, who will review your treatment on an ongoing basis.\nA good relationship with the team means that you can easily discuss your symptoms or concerns. The more the team knows, the more they can help you.\nServices, including support organisations, may work together to provide specialist care and emotional support.\nFind local HIV support services.\nIf you have HIV, you should take extra precautions to prevent exposure to other infections.\nNHS Scotland recommends you get the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.\nEveryone with a long-term condition such as HIV is encouraged to get a flu vaccination each autumn to protect against seasonal flu (influenza).\nIt is also recommended that they get a pneumoccocal vaccination. This is an injection that protects against a serious chest infection called pneumococcal pneumonia.\nIf you're planning a pregnancy and you or your partners viral load is undetectable, your clinic can support you to time unprotected sex to increase your chance of pregnancy. Sperm washing is no longer required to successfully prevent passing on HIV to your child. HIV treatment is available to prevent a pregnant woman from passing HIV to her child.\nWithout treatment, there is a one in four chance your baby will become infected with HIV. With treatment, the risk is less than one in 100.\nAdvances in treatment mean there is no increased risk of passing the virus to your baby with a normal delivery. However, for some women, a caesarean section may still be recommended.\nIt is safest to feed your baby with formula milk. Free formula milk is usually available through your HIV clinic. They can also provide advice on breastfeeding.\nFurther information\nFind out more about living with HIV on the HIV Scotland website.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.\nThe lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes.\nIn Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nRead more about the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma.\nWho's affected?\nHodgkin lymphoma\u00a0can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. Slightly more men than women are affected.\nWhat causes Hodgkin lymphoma?\nThe exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if:\n\nyou\u00a0have a medical condition that weakens your immune system\nyou take immunosuppressant medication\nyou've previously been exposed to\u00a0a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which causes glandular fever\n\nYou also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition.\nRead more about the causes of Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHow Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed\nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a\u00a0biopsy.\nThis is a minor surgical procedure where\u00a0a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.\nRead more about diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma.\nTreatment\u00a0\nHodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it's also one of the most easily treated types of cancer.\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body.\u00a0How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.\nThe main treatments used are\u00a0chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Surgery isn't generally used as a treatment for the condition.\nRead more about:\n\ntreatment for Hodgkin lymphoma\ncomplications of Hodgkin lymphoma\n\n\n\nThe most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a swelling in the neck, armpit or groin. The swelling is usually painless, although some people find that it aches.\nThe swelling is caused by an excess of affected lymphocytes (white blood cells) collecting in a lymph node (also called lymph glands). Lymph nodes are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight infection.\nHowever, it's highly unlikely that you have Hodgkin lymphoma if you have swollen lymph nodes, as these glands often swell\u00a0as a response to infection.\nOther symptoms\nSome people with Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include:\n\nnight sweats\nunintentional weight loss\na high temperature (fever)\na persistent\u00a0cough or feeling of breathlessness\npersistent itching of the skin all over the body\n\nOther symptoms will depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have abdominal pain or indigestion\nA few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they're diagnosed. This\u00a0may lead to:\n\npersistent tiredness or fatigue\nan increased risk of infections\nexcessive bleeding \u2013 such as nosebleeds,\u00a0heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin\n\nIn\u00a0some cases, people with Hodgkin lymphoma experience pain in their\u00a0lymph glands when they drink alcohol.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSpeak to your GP if you\u00a0have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.\nWhile the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by Hodgkin lymphoma, it is best to get them checked out.\n\n\nHodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called B lymphocytes, although the exact reason why this happens isn't known.\nThe DNA gives the cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions so the cells keep growing, causing them to multiply uncontrollably.\nThe abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it's possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your:\n\nbone marrow\nspleen\nliver\nskin\nlungs\n\nWho's most at risk?\nWhile the\u00a0cause of the initial mutation that triggers Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\nhaving a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV\nhaving medical treatment that weakens your immune system \u2013 for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after\u00a0an organ transplant\nbeing previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \u2013\u00a0a common virus that causes glandular fever\nhaving previously had\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma, possibly because of treatment with\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0or radiotherapy\nbeing very overweight (obese)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this may be more of a risk factor in women than men\n\nHodgkin lymphoma isn't infectious and\u00a0isn't thought to\u00a0run in families. Although your\u00a0risk is\u00a0increased if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had lymphoma, it's not clear if this is because of an inherited genetic fault\u00a0or\u00a0lifestyle factors.\nHodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, although most cases are diagnosed in people in their early 20s or 70s. The condition is slightly more common in men than women.\n\n\nIf you speak to your GP because you're concerned about symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma, they'll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination.\nIf necessary, your GP\u00a0will refer you to hospital for further tests.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected Hodgkin lymphoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected cancer: recognition and referral.\nIf you're referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma.\nBiopsy\nA\u00a0biopsy involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory.\nBiopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a\u00a0local anaesthetic (where the area is numbed). In some cases, the affected lymph node isn't easily accessible and a\u00a0general anaesthetic may be required (where you're asleep).\nA pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. If they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of Hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment.\nFurther testing\nIf a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of\u00a0Hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be needed to check how far the lymphoma has spread. This allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma.\nFurther tests may include:\n\nblood tests\u00a0\u2013 samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidneys are working\nbone marrow sample \u2013 another biopsy may be carried out to see if the\u00a0cancer has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic\nchest X-ray\u00a0\u2013 this can check whether the cancer has spread to your chest or lungs\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of the cancer\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0\u2013 this scan\u00a0uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body, to check the spread of the cancer\npositron emission tomography (PET) scan \u2013\u00a0this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and\u00a0can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment;\u00a0it's usually taken at the same time as a CT scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are working\n\nStages of Hodgkin lymphoma\nWhen testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. Staging means scoring the cancer by how far it's spread.\nThe main stages of Hodgkin lymphoma are:\n\nstage 1\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0cancer is limited to one group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs)\nstage 2\u00a0\u2013 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below the diaphragm\nstage 3\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm\u00a0\nstage 4\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0cancer has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow\n\nHealth professionals also\u00a0add the letters A or B to your stage, to\u00a0indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms.\nA is put after your stage if you\u00a0have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. B is put after your stage if you have\u00a0additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats.\n\n\nHodgkin lymphoma can usually be treated successfully with chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.\nYour treatment plan\nYour specific treatment plan will depend on your general health and your age, as\u00a0many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment.\nDiscussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\nYour MDT will recommend the best treatment options\u00a0for you. However, you shouldn't be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.\nTreatment options\nThe main treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma are chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. In a few cases, chemotherapy may be combined with steroid medication.\nSurgery isn't generally used\u00a0to treat the condition, except for the\u00a0biopsy used to diagnose it.\nOverall, treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is highly effective and most people with the condition are eventually cured.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0is a type of cancer treatment where medicine is used to kill cancer cells. This medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on\u00a0the stage of your cancer.\nIf doctors think your cancer is curable, you'll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy).\u00a0If a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms.\nChemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight. However, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome and a longer hospital stay may be needed.\nChemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems:\n\nfatigue\nbreathlessness\nincreased vulnerability to infection\nbleeding and bruising more easily\n\nIf you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.\nOther possible side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\nnausea and vomiting\ndiarrhoea\nloss of appetite\nmouth ulcers\ntiredness\nskin rashes\nhair loss\ninfertility, which may be temporary or permanent\n\nMost\u00a0side effects should pass once your treatment has finished.\u00a0Tell your care team if the side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments\u00a0that can help.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nIf regular chemotherapy is unsuccessful or Hodgkin lymphoma returns after treatment, you may have a course of chemotherapy at a higher dose.\nHowever, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You'll\u00a0need a stem cell or\u00a0bone marrow transplant\u00a0to replace the damaged bone marrow.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0is most often used to treat early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in one part of the body.\nTreatment is normally given in short\u00a0daily sessions, Monday to Friday, over several weeks. You shouldn't have to stay in hospital between appointments.\nRadiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary and will be directly related to the\u00a0part of your body being treated. For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.\nOther common side effects\u00a0include:\n\ntiredness\nnausea and vomiting\ndry mouth\nloss of appetite\n\nMost side effects are temporary,\u00a0but there's a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.\nRead more about:\n\nside effects of radiotherapy\ncomplications of Hodgkin lymphoma\n\nSteroid medication\nSteroid medication\u00a0is sometimes used in combination with chemotherapy as a more intensive treatment for advanced cases of Hodgkin lymphoma, or\u00a0if initial treatment hasn't worked.\nThe steroid medication is given intravenously, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy.\nCommon side effects of steroid medication include:\n\nincreased appetite, which can lead to weight gain\nindigestion\nproblems sleeping\nfeeling agitated\n\nThe side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.\nRituximab\nIf you're diagnosed with a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma called lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have chemotherapy in combination with a medication called rituximab.\nRituximab is a type of\u00a0biological therapy\u00a0called a monoclonal antibody. It\u00a0attaches itself to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulates the immune system to attack and kill the cell.\nIt's given through a drip directly into a vein over the course of a few hours.\nSide effects of the drug can include:\n\nflu-like symptoms, such as headaches, fever\u00a0and muscle pain\ntiredness\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\n\nYou may be given additional medication to prevent or reduce side effects. Any side effects should improve over time as your body gets used to the medication.\nFollow-up\nAfter your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.\nThese appointments start off being every few weeks or months, but will become gradually less frequent over time.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK:\u00a0treating Hodgkin lymphoma\nCancer Research UK:\u00a0living with Hodgkin lymphoma\nMacmillan: treating Hodgkin lymphoma\u00a0\nMacmillan: living with Hodgkin lymphoma\u00a0\n\n\n\nSome people treated for Hodgkin lymphoma experience long-term problems, even if they've been cured.\nWeakened immune system\nHaving a weakened immune system is a common complication of Hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you're being treated.\nIf you have a weak immune system, you're more vulnerable to infections and there's an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. In some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections.\nIt's also important to report any symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately, as prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications.\nSymptoms of infection include:\n\na high temperature (fever)\nheadache\naching muscles\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\n\nVaccination\nYou should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up-to-date.\nHowever, it's important to speak to\u00a0your GP or care team about this, as it may not be safe for you to have 'live' vaccines (vaccines containing a weakened form of the virus or organism being vaccinated against) until several months after your treatment finishes.\nExamples of live vaccines include the:\n\nshingles vaccine\nBCG vaccine (against tuberculosis)\nMMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella) \n\nInfertility\nChemotherapy\u00a0and\u00a0radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause infertility. This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.\nYour care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options.\nIn some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment, so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.\nSecond cancers\nPeople who have had Hodgkin lymphoma are more likely to get lymphoma,\u00a0leukaemia or other cancers in the future. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy further increase this risk.\nSecond cancers, such as breast cancer or lung cancer, usually develop more than 10 years after you're treated for Hodgkin lymphoma. In rare cases, other types of cancer, such as leukaemia or other lymphomas, develop after only a few years.\nYou can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.\nYou should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your GP at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you're invited to.\nOther health problems\nThe risk of developing other health conditions in the future, such as cardiovascular disease and lung disease, is also higher in people who have had Hodgkin lymphoma.\nYou should report unexpected symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, to your GP for further advice.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is usually defined as having a sustained blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above.\nThe line between normal and raised blood pressure is not fixed and depends on your individual circumstances. However, most doctors agree that the ideal blood pressure for a physically healthy person is around 120/80mmHg.\nA normal blood pressure reading is classed as less than 130/80mmHg.\nThe heart (blood pump)\nThe heart is a muscle that is designed to constantly pump blood around the body.\u00a0It pumps blood that is low in oxygen towards the lungs, through the venous 'pipeline' (veins), where it receives a fresh supply of oxygen.\nOnce the blood is fully oxygenated, the heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood around the body so that the oxygen can be used by the body\u2019s muscles and cells, through the arterial 'pipeline' (arteries).\nHow is blood pressure measured?\nBlood pressure is defined as the amount of pressure that is exerted on the artery walls as blood moves through them. It\u00a0is measured in millimetres of mercury, or mmHg.\nA more detailed explanation is provided below.\nTwo measurements are used to measure blood pressure:\n\nSystolic pressure - the measure of blood pressure exerted when your heart beats and forces blood around your body.\nDiastolic pressure - the measure of blood pressure when your heart is resting in between beats.\n\nBoth the systolic and diastolic pressures are measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).\nThe figures are usually represented with the systolic pressure first, followed by the diastolic pressure. Therefore, if your GP says that your blood pressure is '120 over 80', or 120/80mmHg, they mean that you have a systolic pressure of 120mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80mmHg.\nMore about the\u00a0diagnosis of high blood pressure\nSymptoms of high blood pressure\nHigh blood pressure often causes no symptoms, or immediate problems.\nThe only way to find out whether you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked regularly. Ask your GP when you are next due for yours to be checked.\nFind out more about the\u00a0symptoms of high blood pressure\nHow common is high blood pressure?\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition, it is estimated that 18% of adult men and 13% of adult women have high blood pressure but are not getting treatment for it.\nIn 90-95% of cases, there is no single identifiable reason for a rise in blood pressure. But all available evidence shows that lifestyle plays a significant role in regulating your blood pressure.\nRisk factors for high blood pressure include:\n\nage (the risk of developing high blood pressure increases with age. Half of people over 75 years have the condition.)\npoor diet\nlack of exercise\nbeing overweight\nexcessive alcohol consumption.\n\nAlso, for reasons not fully understood, people of Afro-Caribbean and South Asian origin (Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi) are more likely to develop high blood pressure than other ethnic groups.\nMore about the\u00a0causes of high blood pressure\u00a0and how high blood pressure is prevented\nWhat's the impact of having high blood pressure?\nHigh blood pressure is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases such as:\n\ncoronary heart disease\u00a0- where the main arteries that supply your heart (the coronary arteries) become clogged up with plaques (fatty deposits)\nstrokes\u00a0- a serious condition where the blood supply to your brain is interrupted\nheart attacks\u00a0- a serious condition where the blood supply to part of your heart is blocked\n\nDiabetes and kidney disease are also linked to high blood pressure complications.\nMore about\u00a0complications of high blood pressure\nTreatment and prevention of high blood pressure\nHigh blood pressure can be managed or controlled by making changes to your lifestyle, such as:\n\neating a healthier diet\nexercising more regularly\nreducing the amount of alcohol that you drink.\n\nMedication that can help you lower your blood pressure is also available.\nMore about the\u00a0treatment of high blood pressure\n\n\nHigh blood pressure does not usually cause any obvious symptoms. Symptoms can occur in rare cases where a person has a very high blood pressure level so it is good to be aware of these.\nThe symptoms may include:\n\nheadaches\nblurred or double vision\nregular nosebleeds\nshortness of breath\n\nVisit your GP as soon as possible if you have any of these symptoms.\nRegular blood pressure checks for over over 40's\nThe only way to find out whether you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked regularly. Ask your GP when you are next due for yours to be checked.\nBlood pressure checks are usually available on request at most GP surgeries and health clinics. Some surgeries have home monitoring devices available,\u00a0which you may be able to use at the\u00a0time of blood pressure medication start up or change. Many also have a policy of arranging regular checks for you.\nAdults who are over 40 and have not been diagnosed with high blood pressure should have their blood pressure checked at least once every five years. However, your blood pressure should ideally be checked more frequently, particularly if you have any contributory risk factors.\nRegular blood pressure checks if diagnosed with high blood pressure\nIf you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, your blood pressure will need to be closely monitored until it is brought under control.\nAfter your blood pressure has been controlled, your GP or practice nurse will measure your blood pressure at agreed regular intervals (at least once a year).\nIt is important you attend these appointments to ensure your blood pressure is being maintained within an acceptable range.\nBlood pressure checks during pregnancy\nIf you are pregnant, you should have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis, even if it is not high.\nWatching your blood pressure while you are pregnant reduces your risk of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension. This can lead to a serious condition called\u00a0pre-eclampsia where there is a problem with the placenta (the organ that links the baby\u2019s blood supply to the mother\u2019s).\n\n\nThere are two types of high blood pressure:\n\nPrimary high blood pressure (also known as essential high blood pressure) - has no identifiable cause.\nSecondary high blood pressure - is related to an underlying cause, such as kidney disease, or a particular type of medication that you are taking.\n\nYou can find out more about each of these below.\nPrimary high blood pressure\nWhile the specific cause of primary high blood pressure remains unknown, there is compelling evidence to suggest that a number of risk factors increase your chances of developing the condition.\u00a0\nThese risk factors include:\n\nage - the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older\na family history of high blood pressure - the condition seems to run in families\nbeing of Afro-Caribbean or South Asian origin\nhigh-fat diet\nhigh amount of salt in your diet\nlack of exercise\nbeing overweight\nsmoking\nexcessive alcohol consumption\nstress\n\nA number of health conditions, such as diabetes and kidney disease, have also been linked to an increase risk of developing primary high blood pressure.\nSecondary high blood pressure\nSome cases of high blood pressure (between 5 and 10%) are the result of underlying factors or cause and this is known as secondary high blood pressure.\u00a0\nUnderlying factors include:\n\nkidney conditions, such as a kidney infection, or kidney disease\nnarrowing of the arteries (pipeline taking blood round the body from the heart)\nhormonal conditions, such as Cushing's syndrome\u00a0(a condition where your body produces an excess of steroid hormones)\nconditions that affect the body\u2019s tissue, such as lupus\u00a0(a condition where the immune system attacks healthy tissue)\nmedication, such as the oral contraceptive pill, or the type of painkillers that are known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\u00a0(NSAIDs), such as\u00a0ibuprofen\nexcessive alcohol consumption\nrecreational drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamines and crystal meth\n\nOccasionally, a rise in blood pressure can result from taking herbal remedies, such as herbal supplements.\n\n\nThe only way to find out whether you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked regularly. Ask your GP when you are next due for yours to be checked.\nBefore having your blood pressure taken, you should rest for at least five minutes and empty your bladder. To get an accurate blood pressure reading, you should be sitting down and not talking when the reading is taken.\nHaving one high blood pressure reading does not necessarily mean that you have high blood pressure. Your blood pressure can change throughout the day. Feeling anxious or stressed when you visit your GP can raise your blood pressure (often referred to as \u2018white coat syndrome\u2019).\nTherefore, your GP will need to take several readings over a set period of time, usually every month, to see whether your blood pressure level is consistently high.\nBlood and urine tests may also be carried out in order to check for conditions that are known to cause an increase in blood pressure, such as kidney infections.\nYou may also be given a blood pressure device to take home so that you can record your blood pressure level throughout the day. This also helps to identify white coat syndrome and therefore helps to identify the best treatment options for you.\nSphygmomanometer\nBlood pressure is traditionally measured using a device known as a sphygmomanometer. This device uses an inflatable cuff and has a scale of mercury, like a thermometer.\nYour pulse is heard by the health professional taking your blood pressure, through a stethoscope placed on your artery.\nDigital sphygmomanometer\u00a0\nMany GP surgeries now use digital, or semi automatic, sphygmomanometers which measures your pulse using electrical sensors in a cuff that is usually placed around your upper arm.\nThe cuff is pumped up to restrict the blood flow in your arm, before slowly being released.\u00a0\nDigital blood pressure device\nDigital blood pressure devices are now commercially available. Blood pressure testing kits are also commercially available.\u00a0\n\n\nTreatment for high blood pressure will depend on your blood pressure levels and your associated risk (after taking account of several factors) of developing a cardiovascular disease, such as a heart attack\u00a0or stroke.\nThere are seven main risk factors for developing a cardiovascular disease. These are:\n\nage\nhigh blood pressure\nsmoking (or a previous history of smoking)\nobesity\nlack of exercise\nhaving a high level of cholesterol in your blood\nhaving a family history of cardiovascular disease (conditions of the heart or blood vessels).\n\nIf your blood pressure is slightly high\nIf your blood pressure is slightly higher than the ideal level (120/80mmHg), and your GP feels that the risks of cardiovascular disease are low, then you should be able to lower your blood pressure by making simple lifestyle changes (see more below).\nIf your blood pressure is moderately high\u00a0\nIf your blood pressure is moderately high (140/90mmHg or higher), or your GP feels that your risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years is more than one in five, then you will be advised about changing your lifestyle and may also be prescribed medication.\nIf your blood pressure is very high\u00a0\nIf your blood pressure is very high (180/110 mmHg or above) you should be referred to a hypertension specialist (a doctor who specialises in treating high blood pressure).\u00a0\nLifestyle changes\nThe following lifestyle changes are known to reduce high blood pressure:\n\nregular exercise of at least 30 minutes a day, a minimum of five times a week (e.g. walking, cycling or swimming)\ncutting your alcohol intake to recommended levels (less than 21 units a week for men, and less than 14 units a week for women)\neating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet, and restricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day\nlosing weight if you are overweight or obese\nrestricting your caffeine consumption to less than five cups of coffee or tea a day\nrelaxation therapies, such as yoga and meditation\n\nEven if you achieve a relatively low decrease in your blood pressure, it can still have significant health benefits.\nMore about\u00a0preventing high blood pressure\nMedication\nA number of medications can be used to treat high blood pressure. You may need to take more than one type of medication to lower your blood pressure because a combination of treatments is sometimes needed to successfully treat the condition.\nIf you have high blood pressure, you may need to take blood pressure-lowering medication for the rest of your life. However, if your blood pressure levels stay under control for several years, you should ask your GP if you could come off your treatment and have your blood pressure monitored.\nMost medications that are used to treat high blood pressure have some side effects (see below for details of the specific side effects of each type of medication). Consult your GP immediately if you have any of the following common side effects while taking medication for high blood pressure:\n\nfeeling drowsy\npain around your kidney area (on the side of your lower back)\na dry cough\ndizziness, faintness or light-headedness\na skin rash\n\nResearch has shown that different blood pressure lowering medications work better for different ethnic groups. For example, ACE inhibitors are more effective as a first-choice medication for treating high blood pressure in white people, whereas calcium channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics, tend to work better for black people.\nIt is thought that this is because black people tend to have a lower level of renin in their blood. Renin is an enzyme that helps to regulate blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are most effective when there is a high amount of renin in the blood, so they are not as effective in treating black people with high blood pressure.\nTherefore, your GP will consider your ethnic background when making a treatment plan.\nThe most widely used medications for treating high blood pressure are described below:\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\u00a0\nCalcium channel blockers\nThiazide diuretics\nAlpha-blockers\nBeta-blockers\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors work by blocking the actions of some of the hormones that help to regulate blood pressure.\u00a0\nBy stopping these hormones from working, the medication helps to reduce the amount of water in your blood, and it widens your arteries, decreasing your blood pressure.\nACE inhibitors are not suitable for:\n\npregnant or breastfeeding women\npeople with conditions that affect the blood supply to their kidneys\n\nACE inhibitors have been known to reduce the blood supply to the kidneys, which can reduce their efficiency. Therefore, blood and urine tests may be carried out before you start taking ACE inhibitors to make sure that there are no pre-existing problems with your kidneys.\nYou may need to have annual blood and urine tests if you continue to use ACE inhibitors.\nSide effects of ACE inhibitors include:\n\ndizziness\ntiredness or weakness\nheadaches\na persistent dry cough\n\nMost of these side effects should pass in a few days, although some people find that they continue to have a dry cough.\nIf side effects become particularly troublesome, a medication that works in a similar way to ACE inhibitors, known as an angiotensin-2 receptor antagonist, may be recommended.\nACE inhibitors can cause unpredictable effects if taken with other medications, including some over-the-counter (OTC) ones. Therefore, as with any prescribed medication always check with your GP or pharmacist before taking any 'over the counter' medication in combination with those prescribed for you.\nCalcium channel blockers work by relaxing the muscles that make up the walls of your arteries. This widens your arteries and reduces your blood pressure.\nExamples of calcium channel blockers include:\n\nDiltiazem\nVerapamil\nAmolodipine\nNifedipine\n\nEvery calcium channel blocker acts differently. Common side effects of calcium channel blockers should pass within a few days once your body gets used to the medication, these include:\n\nflushed face\nheadaches\nswollen ankles\ndizziness\ntiredness\nskin rashes\nabnormally fast, slow or uneven heart rate\n\nCertain brands of calcium channel blocker may also cause constipation in some people.\nDo not drink grapefruit juice if you are taking calcium channel blockers because it can lower your blood pressure.\nThiazide diuretics, work by reducing the amount of water in your blood and widening the walls of your arteries. They are not recommended for pregnant women, or people who have gout\u00a0(a type of arthritis where crystals develop inside the joints).\nThiazide diuretics have been known to reduce the level of potassium in your blood, which can interfere with your heart and kidney functions. They can also raise the level of sugar in your blood, which could lead to diabetes.\nTherefore, you will probably be recommended to have blood and urine tests every six months so that your potassium and blood sugar levels can be monitored.\nExample of thazide diuretics include:\u00a0\n\nBendrofluazide\nFurosemide\nTorasemide\n\nThe side effects of thiazide diuretics include:\n\ndizziness\nnausea\nmuscle cramps\ngoing to the toilet more during the day and possibly night\n\nA few people have reported that they could not get or maintain an erection while taking thiazide diuretics. However, this particular side effect was resolved once the medication was withdrawn.\nThere are two other types of diuretic available which you may be prescribed these are:\n\nLoop Diuretics\nPotassium-sparing diuretics\n\nAlpha-blockers are effective in reducing high blood pressure. However, they are not usually prescribed unless you are already taking other medication and your blood pressure is still high.\nAlpha-blockers, work by preventing the muscles that line your blood vessels (alpha receptors) from being activated and tightening the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels. This enables the blood vessels to relax and open, making it much easier for blood to flow through them and lower your blood pressure.\nExamples of alpha-blockers include:\u00a0\n\nTolazoline\nDoxasosin\nTrazodone\n\nCommon side effects of alpha-blockers include:\n\nfainting spells when you first start the treatment\ndizziness\nheadache\nswollen ankles\ntiredness\n\nBeta-blockers\u00a0used to be a popular treatment for high blood pressure, but now they only tend to be used when other treatments have not proved successful. This is because beta-blockers have more potential side effects than the other medications that are used to treat high blood pressure.\nBeta-blockers, work by slowing down your heart rate and the force of your heart. This reduces the pressure at which the blood is pumped out of your heart and around your body.\nExamples of beta-blockers include:\u00a0\n\nAtenolol\nBisoprolol\nCarvedilol\nSotolol\nPropranolol.\n\nCommon side effects of beta-blockers include:\n\ntiredness\nnausea\ncold hands and feet\nslow heartbeat\ndiarrhoea\n\nLess common side effects of beta-blockers include:\n\nsleep disturbances\nnightmares\nimpotence\n\nAlthough beta-blockers are not the preferred method of treatment for high blood pressure, they may be considered for younger people if:\n\nother treatments, such as ACE inhibitors, have not been effective\na woman is fertile (can become pregnant)\n\nBeta-blockers can also interact with other medications, causing possible adverse side effects. Therefore, as with any prescribed medication always check with your GP or pharmacist before taking any 'over the counter' medication in combination with those prescribed for you\u00a0\nDo not suddenly stop taking beta-blockers without first consulting your GP. Stopping this medication suddenly will lead to serious side effects, such as a rise in blood pressure or chest pain caused by reduction in oxygen to your heart muscle (angina).\n\n\nIf left untreated, high blood pressure can cause many different types of cardiovascular disease.\u00a0\nFor example:\n\nstroke - a serious condition where the blood supply to the brain is interrupted\nheart attack\u00a0- a serious condition where the blood supply to part of the heart is blocked\nblood clot (thrombosis)\u00a0- a serious condition that is caused by blood clots within the blood vessels\naneurysm\u00a0- a serious condition that is caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall, which forms a bulge in the blood vessel\n\nKidney disease\nHigh blood pressure can damage the small blood vessels in your kidneys and stop them from working properly.\u00a0\nThis can cause a number of symptoms, including:\n\ntiredness\nswollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)\nshortness of breath\nblood and/or protein in your urine\nurinating more often, particularly at night (nocturia)\nitchy skin\n\nKidney disease can be treated using a combination of medication and dietary supplements. Cases that are more serious may require dialysis\u00a0(a treatment where waste products are artificially removed from the body) or a kidney transplant.\nMore about\u00a0chronic kidney disease\n\n\nThe best ways to prevent high blood pressure and the associated risks of cardiovascular disease are to:\n\neat a healthy diet\nmaintain a healthy weight\nexercise regularly\ndrink alcohol in moderation only\ndrink caffeine in moderation only\navoid smoking.\n\nYou can find out more about each of these below.\nEat a healthy diet\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (five portions a day) and whole grains.\nLimit the amount of salt that you eat to no more than 6g (0.2oz) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure (6g of salt is about one teaspoonful).\nAvoid foods that are high in saturated fat as this will increase your cholesterol level, which is another risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\nFoods that are high in saturated fat include:\n\nmeat pies\nsausages and fatty cuts of meat\nbutter\nghee (a type of butter that is often used in Indian cooking)\nlard\ncream\nhard cheese\ncakes and biscuits\nfoods that contain coconut or palm oil\n\nHowever, eating some foods that are high in unsaturated fat can actually decrease your cholesterol level.\nFoods that are high in unsaturated fat include:\n\noily fish\navocados\nnuts and seeds\nsunflower oil, rapeseed oil and olive oil\n\nMore about eating a healthy balanced diet\nMaintain a healthy weight\nBeing overweight is a risk factor for having high blood pressure, and your risk increases further if you are obese.\nThere are two ways to check if you are overweight:\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI) - This is your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. In the UK, people with a BMI of between 25 to 30 are overweight, and those with an index above 30 are classed as obese. People with a BMI of 40 or more are morbidly obese.\u00a0\nWaist size\u00a0- Using a measuring tape place the tape round your waist between the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hip bone. The table below indicates how much your health might be at risk, your ethnicity should also be taken into account.\u00a0\n\nThe best way to tackle obesity is by reducing the amount of calories that you eat, and taking regular exercise. Your GP can provide you with further information and advice on how you can do this.\nMore about having a healthy weight\nExercise\nExercise can raise your blood pressure at time of doing it but regular exercise at the right level for you can help to reduce your blood pressure and maintain a lower level.\nThe following information provides general advice about blood pressure and exercise:\n\nBelow 90/60 - You may have low blood pressure, speak to your doctor or nurse before starting any new exercise\n90/60 to 140/90 - It is safe to be more active, and it will help to keep your blood pressure in this the \u2018ideal\u2019 blood pressure range\n140/90 to 179/99 - It should be safe to start increasing your physical activity to help lower your high blood pressure\n180/100 to 199/109 - Speak to your doctor or nurse before starting any new exercise\n200/110 or above - Do not start any new activity, speak to your doctor or nurse.\n\nMore about keeping active\nDrink alcohol in moderation\nDrinking excessive amounts of alcohol will increase your blood pressure and raise the cholesterol levels in your blood.\nSticking to the recommended amounts of alcohol consumption is the best way to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure.\nThe recommended daily limits of alcohol consumption are:\n\n3 to 4 units of alcohol for men\n2 to 3 units of alcohol for women.\n\nA unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager, a small glass of wine or a pub measure (25ml) or spirits.\nMore about drinking alcohol responsibly\nDrink caffeine in moderation\nIt is important to restrict your daily intake of coffee or drinks that contain caffeine, such as soft drinks and cola.\nYour blood pressure may increase if you drink more than four cups of coffee a day.\nStop\u00a0smoking\nIf you smoke, there is plenty of help and support available to help you quit.\nFind out some\u00a0effective ways to stop smoking\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Hyperhidrosis is a common condition in which a person sweats excessively.\nThe sweating may affect the whole of your body, or it may only affect certain areas.\u00a0Commonly affected areas include\u00a0the:\n\narmpits\npalms of your hands\nsoles of your feet\nface and chest\ngroin\n\nBoth sides of the body are usually affected equally \u2013 for example, both feet or both hands.\nThe sweating doesn't usually pose a serious threat to\u00a0your health, but it can be embarrassing and distressing. It can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to\u00a0feelings of depression and anxiety.\nRead more about the complications of hyperhidrosis.\nWhat is excessive sweating?\nThere are no guidelines to determine what \"normal\" sweating is, but if you feel you sweat\u00a0too much\u00a0and\u00a0your sweating\u00a0has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis.\nFor example, you may have hyperhidrosis if:\n\nyou\u00a0avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands,\u00a0because you\u00a0feel self-conscious about your sweating\nyou don't take part in activities, such as dancing or exercise, for fear they will make your sweating worse\nexcessive sweating is interfering with your job \u2013 for example, you have difficulty holding tools or using a computer keyboard\nyou're having problems with normal daily activities, such as driving\nyou're spending a significant amount of time\u00a0coping with\u00a0sweating \u2013 for example, frequently showering and changing your clothes\nyou become socially withdrawn and self-conscious\n\nWhen to see your GP\nVisit your GP if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively.\nMany people with hyperhidrosis are too embarrassed to seek medical help or believe that nothing can be done to improve it.\u00a0But\u00a0treatment is\u00a0available.\nAlso visit your GP if you are\u00a0having\u00a0night sweats, because it can sometimes be a sign of something more serious.\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose hyperhidrosis based on your symptoms, although occasionally you may need blood and urine tests to\u00a0check for an underlying cause (see below).\nWhat causes hyperhidrosis?\nIn many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. This is known as primary hyperhidrosis.\nHyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. This can have many different triggers, including:\n\npregnancy or the menopause\nanxiety\ncertain medications\nlow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\nan overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\ninfections\n\nRead more about the causes of hyperhidrosis.\nHow hyperhidrosis is treated\nExcessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a treatment right for you.\u00a0\nDoctors usually recommend starting with the least invasive treatment first, such as powerful antiperspirants.\u00a0Lifestyle changes\u00a0may also help, including:\n\nwearing loose and light clothes\navoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, that could make your sweating worse\nwearing black or white clothes\u00a0to\u00a0help minimise the signs of sweating\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t help, you may be advised to try treatments such as iontophoresis (the affected area is treated with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad), botulinum toxin injections, and even surgery in a few cases.\nHyperhidrosis is usually a long-term condition, but some people experience an improvement with time and the treatments available can often keep the problem under control.\nRead more about treating hyperhidrosis.\nWho is affected\nHyperhidrosis is common. It's been estimated to affect between 1\u00a0and 3\u00a0in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the UK.\nHyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty.\n\n\nHyperhidrosis can be divided into 2\u00a0types, depending on whether an obvious cause can be identified. These are known as primary and secondary hyperhidrosis.\nPrimary hyperhidrosis\nHyperhidrosis that has no obvious cause is known as primary hyperhidrosis.\nAlthough it's not clear\u00a0why it\u00a0develops, it's thought to be the result of a problem with part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, and it's possible your genes may also play a role.\nThe sympathetic nervous system controls most of your body\u2019s functions that do not require conscious thought, such as movement of food through your body and the movement of urine out of your kidneys and into your bladder.\nThe sympathetic nervous system also acts like a thermostat. If it senses you are getting too hot, it will send a signal from your brain to the millions of sweat glands in your body to produce sweat. The sweat cools on your skin and reduces the temperature of your body.\nA specific type of sweat gland, known as the eccrine glands, appears to be involved in hyperhidrosis. There are more eccrine glands on your armpits, hands, feet and face, which may explain why these areas are often affected by hyperhidrosis.\nIt's thought that in cases of primary hyperhidrosis, the brain sends signals to the eccrine glands, even though there is no need to cool the body.\nSome cases of primary hyperhidrosis appear to\u00a0run in families, which suggests a genetic mutation may be the cause.\nA genetic mutation is where the instructions in your cells become scrambled, which can disrupt the normal workings of the body. Some genetic mutations can be passed down from parents to their children.\nSecondary hyperhidrosis\nIf a cause of hyperhidrosis can be identified, it's known as secondary hyperhidrosis.\nSecondary hyperhidrosis can have a number of different triggers, including:\n\npregnancy\nthe menopause\u00a0\u2013 when a woman\u2019s monthly periods stop\nanxiety\nlow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\nan overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\nobesity\ncertain medications \u2013 including some antidepressants,\u00a0propranolol, pilocarpine, and\u00a0bethanechol\nbeing drunk or \"high\" on drugs, or withdrawing from alcohol or drugs if you\u00a0have become addicted to them\nsome infections, such as\u00a0tuberculosis and\u00a0HIV\nParkinson\u2019s disease\u00a0\ndisorders of the blood cells or bone marrow, such as Hodgkin lymphoma (a cancer of the white blood cells)\n\nSecondary hyperhidrosis often starts more suddenly than primary hyperhidrosis and tends to affect the whole body.\n\n\nHyperhidrosis can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find the best treatment for you. Less invasive treatments will usually be recommended first.\nLifestyle changes\nChanging your lifestyle cannot cure primary hyperhidrosis (hyperhidrosis with no obvious cause), but it can improve your symptoms and help your confidence.\nThe advice below may help.\n\nAvoid\u00a0triggers that you know make your sweating worse, such as spicy foods and alcohol\nUse antiperspirant frequently, rather than deodorant\nAvoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing and man-made fibres, such as nylon\nWearing black or white clothing can\u00a0minimise signs of sweating\nArmpit shields can absorb excessive sweat and protect your clothes\nWear socks that absorb moisture, such as thick socks made of natural fibres, or special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture\nAvoid wearing socks made out of man-made materials and change your socks at least twice a day if possible\nIdeally wear\u00a0shoes made of leather, and\u00a0try to alternate between different pairs of shoes every day\n\nStronger antiperspirants\nIf\u00a0a regular antiperspirant doesn't\u00a0control your sweating, your GP may prescribe\u00a0or suggest\u00a0a stronger one for you.\nAntiperspirant containing aluminium chloride is often used to treat hyperhidrosis. This works by plugging the sweat glands. You will need to apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning.\nThe most common side effect of aluminium chloride is mild irritation or itching and tingling where it is applied. Using the antiperspirant less frequently can help reduce irritation. Using emollients (moisturisers) regularly and soap substitutes instead of soap may also help.\nAnticholinergics\nYou may be prescribed a type of medicine called an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic. These work by blocking the effects of a chemical called acetylcholine, which the nervous system uses to activate the sweat glands.\nAnticholinergics are available as tablets or solutions that are applied to affected areas. They're not widely used to treat hyperhidrosis and most types are not licensed to treat it, but some people find them helpful.\nPropantheline bromide is an anticholinergic medicine licensed for treating hyperhidrosis. However, anticholinergic medicines unlicensed for hyperhidrosis \u2013 such as oxybutynin and glycopyrronium bromide \u2013 can also be prescribed if your doctor feels they might help.\nPossible side effects of anticholinergics include a dry mouth, blurred vision, stomach cramps, constipation and difficulty passing urine.\nReferral to a dermatologist\nIf lifestyle changes and treatment don't work, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) for further treatment, such as iontophoresis, botulinum toxin or surgery.\nIontophoresis\u00a0may help if you have excessive sweating that affects your hands or feet. It can also be used to treat armpits, although this is usually less effective.\nIontophoresis involves treating affected areas of skin with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad. This is thought to help block the sweat glands.\nIf your hands and feet need treating, you place them in a bowl of water and a weak electric current is passed through the water. If your armpits need treating, a wet contact pad is placed against each armpit and a current is passed through the pad.\nThe treatment is not painful but the electric current can cause mild, short-lived discomfort and skin irritation.\nEach session of iontophoresis lasts between 20 and 30 minutes, and you will usually need to have 2\u00a0to 4\u00a0sessions a week. Your symptoms should begin to improve after a week or 2, after which further treatment will be required at 1\u00a0to 4\u00a0week intervals, depending on how severe your symptoms are.\nIontophoresis is often very effective, although you may need to make regular visits to your local hospital\u2019s dermatology clinic to receive treatment.\nAlternatively, iontophoresis kits that you can use at home may be recommended, with prices in the range of \u00a3250-500.\nBotulinum toxin can be injected into the skin in areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis. This helps reduce sweating in these areas by blocking the signals from the brain to the sweat glands.\nAround 15-20 injections are given in the affected areas of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. The procedure usually takes about 30-45 minutes in total.\nThe effect of the injections usually lasts for several months, after which time the treatment can be repeated if necessary.\nPotential side effects of\u00a0botulinum toxin injections include:\n\npain, redness or itching where the injections are given\nnausea, headaches and hot flushes after the injections are given\nanother part of your body sweating more to make up for treated area \u2013 known as compensatory sweating\nmuscle weakness around the treatment area\n\nMost of these side effects are short-lived or will resolve as the effect of the injections wears off.\nAvailability of botulinum toxin on the NHS can vary widely depending on your clinical commissioning group (CCG), and you may only be able to get it privately. Costs for private treatment depend on the part of the body being treated. For example, injecting the forehead can cost around \u00a3150, while treating both armpits could cost up to \u00a3450 or more.\nSurgery and other procedures\nIn a few cases where hyperhidrosis is particularly severe and treatment\u00a0hasn't been successful, surgery may be recommended.\nEndoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is the most widely used type of surgery to treat hyperhidrosis. It's usually used in cases affecting the palms or armpits.\nSmall incisions are made in the side of the chest and the nerves that control sweating in the affected area are cut or clipped. This means signals can no longer pass along them to the sweat glands. The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic and done on both sides of the body.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that ETS can be used to treat excessive sweating of the palms or underarms. However, before the procedure is performed, your clinician should explain:\n\nETS\u00a0carries a risk of serious complications (see below)\nit's very common for excessive compensatory sweating to occur after the procedure, which causes some people to regret the procedure\nthe procedure is not always successful at reducing sweating\n\nFor this reason, only people with severe hyperhidrosis which hasn't responded to treatment should be considered.\nRead the full NICE guidelines on endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb.\nSide effects and complications of ETS can also include:\n\nsweating of the face and neck after eating food \u2013 this is known as gustatory sweating and may affect up to half of people who have the procedure\nbleeding into the chest during surgery\nair becoming trapped inside the chest (pneumothorax), which can cause chest pain and breathing difficulties\ndamage to the nervous system that causes\u00a0the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop (Horner's syndrome) \u2013 this may be permanent\n\nExcessive sweating under the arms may occasionally be treated with a procedure to remove or destroy the sweat glands in the armpits.\nThis can be carried out in a number of ways:\n\nmaking an incision in the armpit and carefully scraping away (curettage) or cutting out (Shelley\u2019s procedure) the sweat glands\nusing a probe held above the skin (no incisions are needed), which emits electromagnetic radiation that destroys the sweat glands\ninserting a laser device under the skin through a small incision and using it to destroy the sweat glands\n\nThese procedures are generally carried out under local anaesthetic, which means you will be awake but your armpit will be numbed.\nThese procedures can sometimes be a permanent solution to excessive underarm sweating, although they are only carried out by a small number of practitioners. Availability on the NHS is likely to be very limited and you will probably need to pay for private treatment.\nThese procedures don't work for everyone and some of them are relatively new, which means there isn't always evidence about their long-term safety and effectiveness.\nTreating anxiety\nFeelings of anxiety are not directly responsible for causing primary hyperhidrosis, but they can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle.\nYou may feel self-conscious, which can trigger anxiety in certain situations, such as when meeting new people or being in a crowded room. The anxiety can make the sweating worse.\nIf your anxiety is making your sweating worse, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0might help. Medication for anxiety is not usually recommended because it can make sweating worse.\n\n\nHyperhidrosis doesn't usually pose a serious threat to your health, but it can sometimes lead to physical and emotional problems.\nFungal infections\nHyperhidrosis increases the risk of developing fungal infections, particularly\u00a0on the feet\u00a0\u2013 most\u00a0commonly fungal nail infections and athlete\u2019s foot. This is because excessive sweat combined\u00a0with wearing socks and shoes creates an ideal surrounding for fungi to grow.\nFungal infections can be treated with antifungal creams. More severe cases may require antifungal tablets or capsules.\nSkin conditions\nExcessive sweat can make you more vulnerable to\u00a0certain skin conditions, such as:\n\nwarts\u00a0\u2013 small, rough lumps on the skin that are caused by the HPV virus\nboils\u00a0\u2013 swollen red-yellow bumps in the skin that can develop when a hair follicle becomes infected\n\nEczema can\u00a0also be made worse by excessive sweating.\nBody odour\nAlthough people with hyperhidrosis sweat a lot, most don't have problems with body odour. This is because hyperhidrosis doesn't usually affect the sweat glands responsible for producing unpleasant-smelling sweat \u2013 called the aprocrine sweat glands.\nHowever, if bacteria are allowed to break down the sweat, it can start to smell unpleasant. Eating spicy food and drinking alcohol can also make sweat secreted from the eccrine smell.\nThis can be prevented or eased by following lifestyle advice, such as frequently using antiperspirant spray and using armpit shields to absorb sweat.\nSee treating hyperhidrosis for more information.\nEmotional impact\nThe emotional impact of living with hyperhidrosis can be severe. Many people with the condition feel unhappy and, in some cases, depressed. Signs that you may be depressed include:\n\nfeeling down, depressed, or hopeless during the past month\nhaving little interest or pleasure in things during the past month\n\nIt is important not to neglect your mental health. Make an appointment to see your GP if you think that you may be depressed.\u00a0\nRead\u00a0more about\u00a0depression\u00a0or find out more about\u00a0tackling stress, anxiety and depression.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Hypoglycaemia, or a \"hypo\", is an abnormally low level of glucose in your blood (less than four millimoles per litre).\nWhen your glucose (sugar)\u00a0level is too\u00a0low, your body doesn't have enough energy to carry out its activities.\nHypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with diabetes, and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard.\nIn rare cases, it's possible for a person who doesn't have diabetes\u00a0to experience hypoglycaemia. It can be triggered by malnutrition,\u00a0binge drinking or certain conditions, such as Addison's disease.\nRead more about the causes of hypoglycaemia\nSymptoms of hypoglycaemia\nMost people will have some warning that their blood\u00a0glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.\nTypical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness.\nIt's also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking.\nRead more about the symptoms of hypoglycaemia\nCorrecting hypoglycaemia\nThe immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some food or drink that contains sugar, such as dextrose tablets or fruit juice, to correct your blood glucose levels.\nAfter having something sugary, you may need to have a longer-acting \"starchy\" carbohydrate food, such as\u00a0a sandwich or a\u00a0few biscuits.\nIf hypoglycaemia causes a loss of consciousness, an injection of the hormone glucagon can be given to raise blood glucose levels and restore consciousness.

You should be careful when drinking alcohol\u00a0as it can also\u00a0cause hypoglycaemia, sometimes many hours after drinking.\nExercise or activity is another potential cause, and you should have a\u00a0plan for dealing with this, such as eating carbohydrate before, during or after exercise, or adjusting your insulin dose.\nYou should also make sure you regularly change where you inject insulin\u00a0as the amount of insulin your body absorbs can differ depending on where it's injected.\nAlways carry rapid-acting carbohydrate\u00a0with you, such as glucose tablets, a carton of fruit juice (one that contains sugar), or some sweets in case you feel symptoms coming on or your blood glucose level is low.\nMake sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the risk of hypoglycaemia. It may also help to carry some form of identification that lets people know about your condition in an emergency.\nWhen hypoglycaemia occurs as the result of\u00a0an underlying condition other than diabetes, the condition will need to be treated to prevent a further hypo.\nRead more about\u00a0preventing hypoglycaemia\n\n\nThe symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually begin when your blood glucose level drops below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.\nIf you have diabetes,\u00a0particularly if it's treated with insulin, you may be advised to use a small device called a blood glucose meter to\u00a0regularly check your blood glucose levels.\nSymptoms can vary from person to person, and it's important to be aware of the early warning signs so you can treat them.\nSigns and symptoms of hypoglycaemia can include:\n\nfeeling hungry\nsweating\ndizziness\ntiredness (fatigue)\nblurred vision\ntrembling or shakiness\ngoing pale\nfast pulse or\u00a0palpitations\ntingling lips\nirritability\ndifficulty concentrating\nconfusion\ndisorderly or irrational behaviour, which may be mistaken for drunkenness\n\nIf hypoglycaemia isn't treated promptly and your blood glucose levels drop low enough, you may become drowsy or even lose consciousness.\nMost people with insulin-treated diabetes notice that the symptoms of hypoglycaemia change and become less obvious the longer they live with the condition.\nFor some people, the warning symptoms become greatly reduced, putting them at significant risk of having severe episodes where they're dependent on others for help.\nLet your diabetes care team know if you develop this problem\u00a0as your treatment may need to be changed to reduce the risk.\nRead more about how hypoglycaemia is treated\nHypoglycaemia while sleeping\nHaving a\u00a0hypo while you're asleep is known as nocturnal hypoglycaemia. It's more common in people who treat diabetes with insulin.\nAlthough some people find their sleep is disturbed when they experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia,\u00a0you may only notice the symptoms when you wake up in the morning.\nThe symptoms of\u00a0nocturnal hypoglycaemia can include:\n\nheadache\u00a0\u2013\u00a0often likened to having a hangover\nfeeling unusually tired in the morning\ndamp sheets or clothing from sweating\n\n\n\nIn most cases, hypoglycaemia affects people with diabetes, although more rarely it can also occur as a result of other underlying conditions.\nHypoglycaemia in people with diabetes\nA common cause of hypoglycaemia is taking too much insulin for your current needs. Insulin is a medication that helps control your blood glucose levels. It's commonly used to treat\u00a0type 1 diabetes\u00a0and is also recommended for some\u00a0people with\u00a0type 2 diabetes.\nA fall in blood\u00a0glucose levels can also occur after taking too much oral hypoglycaemia medication, such as sulphonylurea, which causes a release of insulin. This medication is often used\u00a0to lower blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes.\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, maintaining the correct blood glucose level involves balancing\u00a0how much\u00a0insulin you inject, the amount of food you eat, and how much energy you burn during exercise.\nHypoglycaemia may occur if you've taken your dose of insulin as usual, but your carbohydrate intake is lower than normal or has been used up more quickly. This may happen if you delay or miss a meal or snack, don't eat enough carbohydrate, or exercise more than usual.\nPeople with diabetes who've\u00a0drunk too much alcohol, or drank alcohol on an empty stomach, can also get hypoglycaemia.\nHowever, it's not always possible to identify why a particular episode of hypoglycaemia has occurred, and sometimes it happens for no obvious reason.\nHypoglycaemia in people without diabetes\nHypoglycaemia\u00a0\u2013 even mild cases\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is very rare in people who don't have diabetes. The possible causes are outlined below.\nPeople without diabetes can sometimes experience hypoglycaemia if their pancreas produces too much insulin after a large carbohydrate-based meal. This is known as reactive hypoglycaemia.\nIt's not clear why this happens, although it's thought to be more common in people who are overweight or have had gastric bypass surgery.\nIn rare cases, a benign (non-cancerous) tumour in the pancreas may cause an overproduction of insulin, or the tumour itself may use up too much glucose.\nOther possible causes of hypoglycaemia in people without diabetes are:\n\nfasting or malnutrition \u2013 where not enough nutrients are consumed for your body to function properly\nbinge drinking or heavy drinking of alcohol\nAddison's disease \u2013 a disorder of the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys)\u00a0\ncertain medication \u2013 hypoglycaemia has been known to occur in people taking quinine (for malaria), salicylates (for rheumatic disease) and propranolol (for high blood pressure)\nsevere illnesses affecting the liver, kidneys or thyroid gland\n\n\n\nIn most cases, you can treat hypoglycaemia yourself when you recognise the symptoms.\nTreating an episode of hypoglycaemia\nThe immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some sugary food or drink (about 15 to 20g of rapidly acting carbohydrate) to end the attack.\nFor example, this could be:\n\na glass of fruit juice or non-diet soft drink\nbetween three and five dextrose tablets\na handful of sweets\n\nAt first you should avoid fatty foods and drinks, such as chocolate and milk, because they don't usually contain as much sugar and the sugar they do contain may be absorbed more slowly.\nAfter having something sugary, you should have a longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar, a piece of fruit or a sandwich.\nIt will usually take around 15 minutes to recover from a mild episode of hypoglycaemia. If you have a blood glucose meter, measure your blood sugar again after 15 to 20 minutes. If it's still too low (below 4mmol), you should have some more sugary food or a drink before testing\u00a0your levels\u00a0again in another 15 to 20\u00a0minutes.\nWhen treating someone else with hypoglycaemia, if the above treatment isn't effective, you may be able to help them by applying glucose gel (or honey, treacle or jam if glucose gel isn't\u00a0available) to the inside of their cheeks, and gently massaging the outside of their cheeks.\nIt may take 10 to 15 minutes before they feel better. This shouldn't be done if the person is drowsy or unconscious because of the risk of choking.\nIf you have several episodes of hypoglycaemia a week, you should contact your diabetes care team to find out the underlying cause. Your medication may need to be adjusted, or there may be another condition causing hypoglycaemia that needs to be treated.\nIf a person is unconscious\nIf a person loses consciousness\u00a0because of\u00a0severe hypoglycaemia, they need to be put into the\u00a0recovery position and given an injection of the hormone glucagon\u00a0(if they have an injection kit). The injection will raise their blood glucose level.\nThe injection should be carried out by a friend or family member who knows what they're doing, or by a trained healthcare professional.\nYou should dial 999 to request an ambulance if:\n\na glucagon injection kit isn't available\nthere's nobody available who's trained to give the injection\nthe injection is ineffective after 10 minutes\n\nNever try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who's unconscious as\u00a0they could choke.\nIf you're able to give a glucagon injection and the person regains consciousness, they should\u00a0eat some longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar or a sandwich.\nYou should continue to monitor the person for signs of recurring symptoms\u00a0in case they need to be treated again.\n\n\nIf you have diabetes, sticking to your medication plan and eating regular meals can help prevent hypoglycaemia.\nIt's also important to monitor your blood glucose levels.\nMonitoring blood glucose\nRegularly\u00a0monitoring your blood glucose levels\u00a0can help you keep your blood glucose as normal and stable as possible, and will help you spot the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia quickly.\nYour blood glucose level can vary throughout the day, so you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you're taking.\nYou can\u00a0monitor your blood glucose levels using a blood glucose meter, a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood.\nRead more about\u00a0living with type 1 diabetes and\u00a0living with type 2 diabetes\nFood and alcohol\nIf you have diabetes, strenuous physical activity can lead to hypoglycaemia. Eating extra carbohydrate-based foods before and during exercise can help reduce\u00a0the chances of this happening.\nIf you're taking insulin, your doctor may advise you to lower your dose before\u00a0you do\u00a0strenuous physical activity.\nAlcohol can also affect your body's ability to release glucose. If you have type 1 diabetes, it's recommended that you drink no more than 2 to 3\u00a0units of alcohol a day and eat a snack after drinking alcohol.\nSpotting the signs\nAs hypoglycaemia can develop suddenly, it's important to be aware of the\u00a0symptoms of hypoglycaemia so you can treat it quickly. Tell your family and friends about the signs to look out\u00a0for and\u00a0let them know how to treat it.\nPeople with\u00a0diabetes are advised to carry a form of identification with them that states their condition so they can be helped quickly and efficiently.\nKeep treatment with you\nIf you're at risk of hypoglycaemia, you should carry sugary food and drink with you at all times to treat mild cases as soon as possible.\nIf you have diabetes, particularly type 1 diabetes, your doctor may recommend medications such as glucose gel\u00a0to carry with you. This can be used to treat hypoglycaemia that doesn't respond to normal treatment.\nIf you're being treated with insulin, you'll usually be given a kit that contains an\u00a0injection of a medication called glucagon. Family members or your carer can be trained\u00a0to carry out the injection, which should be used if you lose consciousness because of\u00a0severe hypoglycaemia.\nPreventing hypoglycaemia at night\nIt's important to avoid recurrent hypoglycaemia during the night (nocturnal hypoglycaemia)\u00a0as it can reduce the early symptoms of daytime episodes.\nIf you experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia, you can try:\n\nkeeping something sugary by your bedside\nhaving a snack before bedtime, such as biscuits and milk\nchecking your blood glucose levels between 3am and 4am, when\u00a0hypoglycaemia is most likely to occur\n\nHypoglycaemia and driving\nAs hypoglycaemia can cause confusion, drowsiness, or even unconsciousness, this can present a significant risk to you or other road users.\nIf you have diabetes that requires treatment with insulin, you must:\n\ninform the DVLA and your insurance company\ntest your blood sugar before driving and at regular intervals (at least every\u00a0two hours) while driving\navoid driving if your blood glucose is low\navoid driving for 45 minutes after treating hypoglycaemia\ncarry rapid-acting carbohydrates with you in the vehicle at all times\n\nIf you experience hypoglycaemia while driving, pull over and stop as soon as it's safe to do so. Remove the keys from the ignition and get out of the driver's seat before\u00a0treating hypoglycaemia in the normal way.\nIf you have two or more episodes of hypoglycaemia that require assistance in a 12-month period, it's a legal requirement to stop driving and inform the DVLA.\nIf you're a group two driver (you hold a licence to drive buses, coaches or lorries), you're legally required to stop driving group two vehicles immediately and inform the DVLA if you have a single episode of hypoglycaemia that requires assistance.\nInform your diabetes care team if you start having problems recognising hypoglycaemia or you start to have more regular episodes, even\u00a0if there were\u00a0warning symptoms and you were able to treat them without assistance.\nSee the\u00a0GOV.UK website for more information about hypoglycaemia and driving\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.\nIt's not clear what causes it, but it usually affects people around 70-75 years of age and is rare in people under 50.\nSeveral treatments can help reduce the rate at which IPF gets worse, but there's currently no treatment that can stop or reverse the scarring of the lungs.\nSymptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\nThe symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time.\nSymptoms can include:\n\nshortness of breath\na persistent dry cough\ntiredness\nloss of appetite and\u00a0weight loss\nrounded and swollen\u00a0fingertips (clubbed fingers)\n\nMany people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape.

This causes the lungs\u00a0to become stiff and means it's difficult for oxygen to get into\u00a0the blood.\nThe reason this happens isn't clear. Idiopathic means the cause is unknown.\nIPF has been linked to:\n\nexposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust\nviral infections\na family history of IPF \u2013 around 1 in 20 people with IPF has another family member with the condition\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\u00a0\nsmoking\n\nBut it's not known whether some of these factors directly cause IPF.\nTreatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\nThere's currently no cure for IPF, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow\u00a0down its progression.\nTreatments include:\n\nself-care measures\u00a0\u2013 such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly\nmedication to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens \u2013 such as pirfenidone and nintedanib\nbreathing oxygen through a mask \u2013\u00a0you can do this while you're at home and/or while you're out and about\npulmonary rehabilitation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily\na\u00a0lung transplant\u00a0\u2013 this is suitable in a few cases,\u00a0although donor lungs are rare\n\nRead more about\u00a0how idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is treated.\nOutlook for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\nIPF\u00a0gets worse over time, although the speed at which this happens is highly variable.\nSome people respond well to treatment and remain relatively free of symptoms for many years, while others may get rapidly worse or find the breathlessness debilitating.\nOther problems can also sometimes develop, including chest infections, pulmonary hypertension\u00a0and heart failure.\nIt's\u00a0very difficult\u00a0to predict\u00a0how long someone with IPF will survive at the time of diagnosis. Regular monitoring over time can indicate whether it's getting worse quickly or slowly.\nBefore the availability of specific treatments like pirfenidone and nintedanib about half of people with IPF lived at least three years from their diagnosis. Around 1 in 5 survived for more than five years.\nIt's hoped these figures will be improved by the availability of new treatments to slow the disease's progression.\n\n\nThe most common symptom of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is shortness of breath, often when physically active, which can get worse over time.\nAt first, many people ignore their\u00a0breathlessness (especially older patients) and blame it on getting old or being out of shape.\u00a0But as the disease progresses and lung damage\u00a0becomes more severe, even light activity\u00a0like getting dressed or having a shower can cause breathlessness.\nOther symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis include:\n\na persistent dry cough\ntiredness\nloss of appetite and\u00a0weight loss\n\nIn up to half of all cases, there is also a change in the shape of the finger and toenails. This thickening of tissue at the base of the finger and toenails is known as digital clubbing. The exact cause of clubbing is unknown, but it can occur in people with various chest and heart diseases.\nSecondary conditions\nThe strain IPF can place on your lungs and your heart can trigger a number of secondary conditions, outlined below.\nYou will have an increased risk of developing chest and airway infections such as:\n\nbronchitis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the airway of the lungs\npneumonia\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the air sacs of your lungs\ninfluenza (flu)\n\nSymptoms of a chest infection include:\n\nworsening breathlessness\nchest pain\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\u00a0\nsweating and shivering\n\nAround a third of people with IPF will also go on to develop pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is when blood pressure inside the arteries connecting the lungs to the heart is dangerously high.\nSymptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:\n\ndizziness\nfeeling faint\nchest pain (angina)\na racing heartbeat (tachycardia)\n\nRead more about symptoms of pulmonary hypertension.\nHeart failure, where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body, can develop when IPF becomes severe.\nThis is due to a combination of factors, including a build-up of blood in the right side of the heart (the side that pumps blood to the lungs), which develops because it is difficult to pump blood through the scarred lung tissue. The poor supply of oxygen from the diseased lungs to the heart muscle also contributes to heart failure.\nHeart failure can cause various symptoms, including:\n\nworsening breathlessness\nextreme tiredness and weakness\nswelling in the legs, ankles and feet (oedema) caused by a build-up of fluid\n\nRead more about the symptoms of heart failure.\n\n\nThe exact cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is not known. Idiopathic means having no known cause.\nThe current theory is that IPF is triggered when cells that line the lung alveoli (air sacs) become damaged by exposure to\u00a0one of several\u00a0substances or viruses.\nThe damaged cells try to repair themselves but the process becomes uncontrolled, resulting in thickening and scarring (fibrosis) of the alveoli and surrounding lung tissue. The amount of oxygen that can pass from the lungs into the blood is then significantly reduced.\nTriggers\nA number of factors have been suggested as possible triggers for the initial damage to the cells lining the alveoli. Most experts agree that the two most significant risk factors are:\n\nbeing a smoker or having smoked in the past\noccupational exposure to certain types of dust \u2013 jobs that involve working with wood, metal, textile, stone, cattle or farming may\u00a0increase the risk of IPF\u00a0\n\nOther possible risk factors include:\n\nviral infections \u2013 such as the Epstein-Barr virus or hepatitis C\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) (where the acid from your stomach rises back up into your throat) \u2013 this may be accidentally inhaled into the lungs, causing damage to the alveoli\nchronic aspiration \u2013 where food, drink or saliva enter the lungs and is not coughed back up, often due to a related condition\nenvironmental pollutants or dust\ngenetic tendency \u2013\u00a0the condition appears to run in some families but this only seems to be the case in around 5% of people with IPF\n\nAs IPF is such a rare condition it is hard to estimate how much of an impact these risk factors can have on your chance of developing it.\n\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be hard to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other lung conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nYour GP\u00a0can refer you to hospital specialists for a number of tests to help rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis.\nThe checks and tests you may have include:\nMedical history and examination\nBreathing and blood tests\nChest X-ray and CT scan\nBronchoscopy\nLung biopsy\nMedical history and examination\nYour doctor will ask about your medical history and whether there are other factors that could be causing a problem with your lungs, such as whether you:\n\nsmoke or have smoked in the past\nhave been exposed to harmful substances at work, such as asbestos\nhave\u00a0other medical conditions\n\nThey may also:\n\ncheck the sound of your breathing through a stethoscope \u2013\u00a0a crackling sound can suggest lung scarring (fibrosis)\nlook at your fingers to see if the ends are swollen (finger clubbing)\nask you to walk around for a few minutes to see if you become breathless\n\nBreathing and blood tests\nLung function tests (also called pulmonary function tests) assess how well your lungs work and can help indicate what the problem may be.\nThese tests measure:\n\nhow quickly you can move air in and out of your lungs\nhow much air\u00a0your lungs\u00a0can hold\nhow well\u00a0your lungs\u00a0transfer oxygen into your blood and\u00a0remove carbon dioxide from it (this can be checked using a blood test)\n\nA commonly used lung function test is spirometry. During the test, you breathe into a mouthpiece that's attached to a monitor.\nChest X-ray and CT scan\nA chest X-ray\u00a0doesn't show the lungs in much detail, but it can help doctors spot some more obvious problems that could be causing your symptoms,\u00a0such as cancer or a build-up of fluid.\nIf IPF is suspected, the chest x-ray will be followed by a computerised tomography (CT) scan.\u00a0\nA CT scan is similar to an X-ray,\u00a0but lots more images are taken and these are put together by a computer to create a more detailed image of your lungs.\nThis can help your doctor spot signs of scarring in your lungs.\nBronchoscopy\nIf doctors still aren't sure what the problem is after the tests described above, they may suggest having a\u00a0bronchoscopy.\nThis is a test where a narrow, flexible tube with a camera (bronchoscope) is passed down into your airways.\nYour doctor can then look for anything abnormal and can take small tissue samples for testing.\nYou'll usually be awake for a bronchoscopy and it may cause coughing. Local anaesthetic will be used to numb your throat so it doesn't hurt and you may also be given a sedative injection which will make you feel sleepy during the procedure.\nLung biopsy\nIf other tests aren't conclusive, a lung\u00a0biopsy\u00a0may need to be carried out.\nThis involves keyhole surgery to remove a small sample of lung tissue so it can be analysed for signs of scarring.\nThe procedure is performed under a general anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're asleep).\u00a0Your surgeon makes several small incisions (cuts) in your side and an endoscope (a thin tube with a camera and a light at the end) is inserted into the area between the lungs and the chest wall.\nThe surgeon can see the lung tissue through the endoscope and is able obtain a small sample.\n\n\nThere's currently no cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The main aim of treatment is to relieve the symptoms as much as possible and slow down its progression.\nThe main treatments are:\nSelf-care\nMedication\nOxygen support\nPulmonary rehabilitation\nLung transplant\nAs the condition becomes more advanced,\u00a0end of life (palliative) care will be offered.\nSelf-care\nThere are several things you can do to stay as healthy as possible if you have IPF.\nThese include:\n\nstopping smoking if you smoke\nexercise regularly\u00a0and stay as fit as you can\neat a healthy, balanced diet\nmake sure you\u00a0get\u00a0the\u00a0annual flu jab\u00a0and one-off\u00a0pneumococcal vaccination\u00a0\u2013 these infections can be more serious if you have a lung condition\ntry to keep away from people with\u00a0chest infections and\u00a0colds whenever possible\n\nMedication\nThere are two medications that can help slow down the progression of IPF in some people:\u00a0pirfenidone and nintedanib.\nSome people also take a medication called\u00a0N-acetylcysteine, although its benefits are uncertain.\nPirfenidone helps to slow the development of scarring in the lungs by reducing the activity of\u00a0the immune system. It's normally taken as capsules three times a day.\nIt's recommended if breathing tests have shown\u00a0your lung capacity is 50-80% of what would normally be expected.\nIf your condition gets worse despite taking\u00a0pirfenidone and your lung capacity falls by 10% or more within a year,\u00a0the medication will usually\u00a0be stopped.\nSide effects of pirfenidone can include:\n\nfeeling sick\ntiredness\ndiarrhoea\nindigestion\na rash caused by\u00a0exposure to sunlight\n\nFor further information see, the\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on pirfenidone for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nNintedanib is a newer medication that can also help slow down scarring of the lungs in some people with IPF.\u00a0It's normally taken as capsules twice a day.\nLike\u00a0pirfenidone, it may be\u00a0used if you have\u00a0a lung capacity 50-80% of what would normally be expected and should be stopped if your lung capacity falls by 10% or more in a year while taking it.\nSide effects of\u00a0nintedanib can include:\n\ndiarrhoea\nfeeling and being sick\nabdominal (tummy) pain\nloss of appetite and weight loss\n\nFor further information, see the NICE guidelines on\u00a0nintedanib for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nN-acetylcysteine is what's known as an antioxidant. It's\u00a0available from many health shops\u00a0and is usually taken as tablets.\nThere is some limited evidence to suggest it\u00a0may reduce the amount of scar tissue in the lungs, although\u00a0other studies have not shown any benefit.\nIf you're considering taking N-acetylcysteine, you should check with your specialist first\u00a0as it may not be safe or suitable for everyone with IPF.\nOxygen support\nIPF can cause\u00a0levels of oxygen in\u00a0your blood fall, which can make you feel more breathless.\nIf this happens, oxygen treatment\u00a0can help with your breathing and allow you to be more active.\nOxygen is taken through nasal tubes or a mask\u00a0attached to a small machine. This device provides a much higher level of oxygen\u00a0than the air. The tubes from the machine are long, so you'll be able to move around your home while connected.\nRead further about home oxygen treatment.\nPortable oxygen\u00a0devices that you can use\u00a0while you're out and about are also available.\nPulmonary rehabilitation\nPulmonary rehabilitation is used for many long-term lung conditions and aims to help patients come to terms with their condition, learn the best ways to deal with it and improve their ability to function on a daily basis without\u00a0severe breathlessness.\nCourses in pulmonary rehabilitation are usually held locally and may involve:\n\neducation about pulmonary fibrosis\nphysical activity\nbreathing exercises\nadvice on nutrition\npsychological support\na social support network\n\nLung transplant\nIf your condition continues to get worse despite treatment, your specialist may recommend a lung transplant. The decision to have a transplant will be based on:\n\nhow bad your condition is\nhow quickly your condition is getting worse\nyour age and general health\nhow much your condition is likely to improve after a transplant\nwhether a donor lung is available\n\nA lung transplant can significantly improve life expectancy in people with IPF, although it's a major procedure that puts a great strain on the body.\nFew people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are suitable candidates for a transplant and donor lungs are scarce.\nPalliative care\nIf you're told there is nothing more that can be done to treat your IPF or you decide to decline treatment, your GP or care team will provide you with support and treatment to relieve your symptoms.\nThis is called palliative care.\nYou can choose to receive palliative care:\n\nat home\nin a care home\nin hospital\u00a0\nin a hospice\n\nYour doctor or care team should work with you to establish a clear plan based on your wishes.\nFor further information see\u00a0End of life care.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and blisters. It's not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment.\nImpetigo\u00a0is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages.\nThis topic covers:\nSymptoms\nWhen to seek medical advice\nCauses\nTreatment\nPreventing the spread of impetigo\nPreventing recurrent impetigo\nComplications\nSymptoms of impetigo\nThere are two types of impetigo:\n\nnon-bullous impetigo \u2013 the most common type\nbullous impetigo\n\nThe symptoms of\u00a0both types\u00a0are described\u00a0below.\nThe symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores \u2013 usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.\nThe sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.\nAfter the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.\nThe sores aren't painful, but they may be itchy. It's important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people.\nOther symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.\nThe symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across.\nThe blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.\nThe blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it's important not to\u00a0touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.\nSymptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.\nWhen to get professional\u00a0advice\nAdults and children over 2 years with impetigo can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service directory.\nImpetigo isn't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.\nCauses of impetigo\nImpetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus or\u00a0Streptococcus pyogenes.\nThe bacteria can infect the skin in two main ways:\n\nthrough a break in otherwise healthy skin\u00a0\u2013 such as a cut,\u00a0insect bite or other injury\u00a0\u2013 this is known as primary impetigo\nthrough skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema \u2013 this is known as secondary impetigo\n\nThe bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels.\nAs the condition doesn't cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it's often easily spread to others unintentionally.\nChildren and people\u00a0with\u00a0diabetes\u00a0or a weakened immune system \u2013\u00a0either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 are most at risk of developing impetigo.\nTreating impetigo\nImpetigo\u00a0usually gets better without treatment in around two to three weeks.\nHowever, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can\u00a0lower the\u00a0risk of the infection being spread to others.\nThe main treatments prescribed are\u00a0antibiotic creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week.\nRead about treating impetigo.\nPreventing the spread of impetigo\nDuring treatment, it's important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body.\nMost people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. It's important to\u00a0stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this\u00a0point.\nThe advice below can also\u00a0help to prevent the spread of the infection:\n\ndon't share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo \u2013 wash them at a high temperature after use\nwash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing\navoid\u00a0touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them\u00a0\u2013 it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short\navoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym\u00a0\u2013 until the risk of infection has passed\nwash your hands frequently\u00a0\u2013 particularly after touching infected skin\nwashable toys should also be washed\u00a0\u2013 wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely\n\nIf you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they're seen by a pharmacist as soon as possible.\nPreventing recurrent\u00a0impetigo\nTo\u00a0reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. Ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly.\nIf you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby.\nIf you're found to carry these bacteria,\u00a0you may be prescribed an antiseptic\u00a0nasal cream to apply several times a day for five to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring.\nComplications of impetigo\nComplications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.\nSome complications associated with impetigo include:\n\ncellulitis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue\nscarlet fever\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body\nguttate\u00a0psoriasis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection\nsepticaemia (a type of sepsis)\u00a0\u2013 a bacterial infection of the blood\nStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water\npost-streptococcal\u00a0glomerulonephritis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys\n\nIn very rare cases,\u00a0impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores\n\n\nImpetigo does not cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after you first become infected. This means that people can easily pass the infection on to others without realising it.\nThere are two main types of impetigo, known as non-bullous and bullous impetigo, which have different symptoms. Most people with impetigo have the non-bullous type.\nThe symptoms of non-bullous and bullous impetigo are described\u00a0below.\nNon-bullous impetigo\nThe symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores \u2013 usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.\nThe sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.\nAfter the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually heals without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.\nThe sores are not painful, but they may be itchy. It is important not to touch, or scratch, the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of your body, and to other people.\nOther symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.\nBullous impetigo\nThe symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the trunk (the central part of the body between the waist and neck) or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across.\nThe blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.\nThe blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it is important that you do not touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.\nSymptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.\n\n\nImpetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.\nThese bacteria can infect the skin in two ways:\n\nthrough a break in otherwise healthy skin, such as\u00a0a cut, insect bite or other injury \u2013 this is known as primary impetigo\nthrough skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as head lice, scabies or eczema \u2013 this is known as secondary impetigo\n\nThe bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels.\nAs the condition does not cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it is often easily spread to others unintentionally.\nImpetigo stops being infectious after 48 hours of treatment starting or after the sores have stopped blistering or crusting.\nIncreased risk\nIn addition to the situations mentioned above, there are a number of other factors that can increase your chances of developing impetigo. These include:\n\nbeing a child \u2013 impetigo is thought to be more common in children because their immune system has not yet fully developed and because they tend to spend time in places where the infection can easily be spread, such as schools and nurseries\nhaving diabetes\nbeing a carrier of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria \u2013 these bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, but they can sometimes cause impetigo if they get into damaged skin nearby\nwarm and humid weather \u2013 impetigo tends to be more common during the summer months in the UK, possibly because the warm and moist weather is a better environment for the bacteria to grow and/or because the skin is more likely to be exposed to insect bites and cuts at this time of year\nhaving a weakened immune system, either due to a condition such as HIV or a treatment such as chemotherapy\n\n\n\nImpetigo isn't usually serious and often clears up without treatment after two to three weeks.\nTreatment is often recommended as it can help clear up the infection in around seven to 10 days and reduce the risk of the infection being passed on to others.\nIf impetigo is confirmed, it can usually be effectively treated with antibiotics.\nIf the infection is being caused by an underlying skin condition, such as eczema, this may also need to be treated.\nAntibiotic cream\nFor mild cases of impetigo that cover a small area, antibiotic cream is often recommended. This usually needs to be applied three or four times a day for seven days.\nBefore applying\u00a0the cream, wash any\u00a0affected areas of skin with warm, soapy water and try to clean off any crusts that have developed.\nTo reduce the risk of spreading the infection, it's also important that you\u00a0wash your hands immediately after applying the cream or, if available, wear latex gloves while applying the cream.\nSide effects of antibiotic cream can include:\n\nirritation\nredness\nitchiness in the area where the cream is applied\n\nIf symptoms haven't improved\u00a0after seven days of starting treatment,\u00a0ask your pharmacist about other possible treatment options.\nAntibiotic tablets\nAntibiotic tablets may be prescribed\u00a0if the infection is more severe and widespread, or\u00a0if the symptoms don't improve after using antibiotic cream. These usually need to be taken two to four times a day for seven days.\nIf a course of oral antibiotics is prescribed for you or your child, it's very important that the course is finished even if the symptoms clear up before you've taken\u00a0all\u00a0the tablets.\u00a0\nCommon side effects of oral antibiotics include:\n\nfeeling sick\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\n\nSpeak to your pharmacist if your symptoms haven't improved after seven days of treatment with antibiotic tablets.\nFurther testing and treatment\nFurther tests are usually only required in cases where the infection is severe or widespread, doesn't respond to treatment, or keeps recurring.\nIn these circumstances, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for further tests or they may take a swab\u00a0of the affected skin\u00a0themselves for testing.\nThis can help to rule out or confirm other skin conditions that may be responsible for your symptoms and can detect whether you carry one of the types of bacteria responsible for the\u00a0infection inside your nose.\nIf your doctor thinks you may keep getting\u00a0impetigo because you naturally have these bacteria inside your nose, they may prescribe you an antiseptic nasal cream to try to clear the bacteria.\n\n\nComplications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your pharmacist if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse.\nSome complications associated with impetigo are described below.\nCellulitis\nCellulitis occurs when the infection spreads to a deeper layer of skin. It can cause symptoms of red, inflamed skin with fever and pain. It can usually be treated with antibiotics, and\u00a0painkillers can be used to relieve pain.\nGuttate psoriasis\nGuttate\u00a0psoriasis is a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection. It is usually more common after a throat infection, but some cases have been linked to impetigo.\nGuttate psoriasis causes small, red, droplet-shaped, scaly patches on the chest, arms, legs and scalp.\nCreams can be used to control the symptoms and in some cases\u00a0the condition will disappear completely after a few weeks.\nScarlet fever\nScarlet fever\u00a0is a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body. Associated symptoms of infection, such as nausea, pain and vomiting, are also common.\u00a0The condition is usually treated with antibiotics.\nScarlet fever is not usually serious but it is contagious. Therefore, it's important to isolate an infected child and avoid close physical contact. Keep your child away from school and other people until\u00a0they have\u00a0been taking\u00a0antibiotics for at least 24 hours.\nSepticaemia\nSepticaemia (a type of sepsis) is a bacterial infection of the blood. It can cause:\n\ndiarrhoea\ncold, clammy skin\na high temperature (fever)\nrapid breathing\nvomiting\nlow blood pressure\u00a0(hypotension)\nconfusion\nfeeling faint and dizzy\nlosing consciousness\n\nSepticaemia is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics in hospital.\nScarring\nIn rare cases, impetigo may lead to some scarring. However, this is more often the result of someone scratching at blisters, crusts or sores. The blisters and crusts themselves should not leave a scar if left to heal.\nThe red mark left after the crusts and blisters clear up should also disappear by itself. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.\nStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome\nStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a serious skin condition in which one of the causes of impetigo \u2013 Staphylococcus bacteria \u2013 releases a toxin (poison) that damages the skin.\nThis leads to extensive blistering that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water.\nOther symptoms of SSSS include:\n\npainful skin\na high temperature (fever)\nlarge areas of skin peeling off or falling away\nredness of the skin which usually spreads across the entire body\n\nSSSS usually requires immediate treatment in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys. It's a very rare complication of impetigo.\nThe symptoms of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis include:\n\na change in the colour of your urine to a reddish-brown or cola colour\nswelling of the abdomen (tummy),\u00a0face, eyes, feet and ankles\na rise in blood pressure\nvisible\u00a0blood in your urine\na reduction in the amount of urine you would normally produce\n\nPeople with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis will usually require immediate hospital treatment so their blood pressure can be carefully monitored and controlled.\nPost-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can be fatal in adults, although deaths in children are rare.\n\n\nAs impetigo is a highly contagious condition, it is important to take precautions to reduce the risk of the infection spreading.\nStopping\u00a0the infection spreading\nThe advice below can help to prevent the spread of the infection to other people or to other areas of the body:\n\nStay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until the sores have dried up, blistered or crusted over, or until 48 hours after starting treatment.\nDon't share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo, and wash them at a high temperature after use.\nWash the sores with soap and water, and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing if possible.\nAvoid\u00a0touching the sores, or letting others touch them, whenever possible.\nDon't scratch the affected areas. It may help to ensure your or your child's nails are kept clean and short to reduce the risk of further damage caused by scratching.\nAvoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym until the risk of infection has passed (when the rash has crusted over, or after at least 48 hours of treatment with antibiotics).\nWash your hands frequently, particularly after touching infected skin.\nWashable toys should also be washed. Wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely.\n\nIf you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they\u00a0contact their pharmacist as soon as possible.\nPreventing re-infection\nTo\u00a0reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean, and ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly.\nIf you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria\u00a0inside your nose. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infected broken skin nearby.\nIf you are found to carry these bacteria,\u00a0you may be prescribed an antiseptic nasal cream to apply several times a day for five to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Indigestion can be pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia) or burning pain behind the breastbone (heartburn).\nDyspepsia and\u00a0heartburn\u00a0may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking.\nCommon associated symptoms include:\n\nfeeling full or bloated\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nbelching\nbringing up (regurgitating) fluid or food into the gullet (oesophagus)\n\nIndigestion is a common problem that affects many people, but in most cases it's mild and only occurs occasionally.\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of indigestion.\nWhy it happens\nIndigestion\u00a0may be\u00a0caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful.\nThe majority of people with indigestion don't have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching).\nIn most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be\u00a0triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress\u00a0or taking certain medications.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of indigestion.\nTreating indigestion at home\nMost people are able to\u00a0treat indigestion with simple changes to their\u00a0diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids.\nRead more about the\u00a0treatment of indigestion.\nVery rarely,\u00a0a serious\u00a0underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. If this is suspected, then\u00a0further investigation such as an endoscopy\u00a0will be required (see below).\nWhen to get professional advice\nIf you have symptoms of indigestion you can get treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory.\nMost people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. However, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP if you\u00a0have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply:\n\nyou are 55 years old or over\nyou have lost a lot of weight without meaning to\nyou have increasing\u00a0difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\nyou have persistent vomiting\nyou have\u00a0iron deficiency anaemia\nyou have a lump in your stomach\nyou have blood in your vomit or\u00a0blood in your stools\n\nThis is because these symptoms\u00a0may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a\u00a0stomach ulcer\u00a0or\u00a0stomach cancer. You may need to be referred for an endoscopy\u00a0to rule out any serious cause.\nAn endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end).\nSevere indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach. Read more about the possible\u00a0complications of severe indigestion.\n\n\nThe main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). People often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own.\nThese symptoms\u00a0usually come on soon after eating or drinking, although there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and experiencing indigestion.\nHeartburn\u00a0is caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus).\nIf you have indigestion, you may also have symptoms such as:\n\nfeeling uncomfortably full or heavy\nbelching or\u00a0flatulence(passing wind)\nbringing\u00a0food or fluid\u00a0back up from your stomach (reflux)\nbloating\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nvomiting\n\n\n\nIndigestion has a number of different causes, but it's rarely due to a serious, underlying condition.\nIt's normal for your stomach to produce acid, but sometimes this acid can irritate the lining of your stomach, the top part of your bowel (duodenum) or your gullet (oesophagus).\nThis irritation can be painful and often causes a burning sensation. Indigestion may also be due to the lining of your digestive system being overly sensitive to acid, or the \"stretching\" caused by eating.\nIndigestion can also be triggered or made worse\u00a0by other factors. Some of these are explained below.\nMedications\nYou may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. Some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up.\nOther medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can affect your digestive tract and cause\u00a0indigestion.\nDo\u00a0not take NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, if you have stomach problems, such as a\u00a0stomach ulcer, or have had this in the past. Children under 16 years of age should not take aspirin.\nNever stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are\u00a0told to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care.\nObesity\nIf you are very overweight, you are more likely to experience indigestion because of increased pressure inside your stomach (abdomen).\u00a0\nThe increased pressure, particularly after a large meal, may lead to acid reflux into the oesophagus.\nStress or anxiety\nIf you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.\nRead\u00a0some relaxation tips to relieve stress.\nHiatus hernia\nA hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall.\nA\u00a0hiatus hernia\u00a0occurs when part of your stomach pushes up into your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under your lungs).\u00a0It may partially block refluxed stomach\u00a0acid clearing from your oesophagus, leading to heartburn.\nHelicobacter pylori infection\nHelicobacter infection is very common. It may lead to stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer. In most cases, however, it\u00a0does not cause any symptoms at all.\nSome people may get bouts of indigestion from helicobacter infection and, in these cases, getting rid of the bug with antibiotics (eradication) will help. However, many cases of indigestion are not caused by helicobacter, and in these cases eradication will not get rid of symptoms.\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\u00a0is a common condition and one of the main causes of recurring indigestion. It's caused by acid reflux, which\u00a0occurs when the oesophageal sphincter fails to prevent stomach acid from moving back up into your oesophagus.\nA little bit of acid reflux is normal and rarely cause any symptoms. It becomes GORD when large amounts of reflux occur, and the sensitive lining of your oesophagus may get inflamed by repeated irritation from stomach acid. This can lead to heartburn, the sensation of regurgitation or painful swallowing.\nStomach\u00a0ulcers\nA\u00a0stomach ulcer\u00a0is an open sore that develops on the inside lining of your stomach (a gastric ulcer) or small intestine (a duodenal ulcer). If you have a\u00a0stomach ulcer, you may have indigestion as a symptom.\nStomach\u00a0ulcers form\u00a0when stomach acid damages the lining in your stomach or duodenum wall. In most cases, the lining is damaged as a result of an H pylori infection (see above).\nStomach cancer\nIn rare cases, recurring bouts of indigestion can be a symptom of\u00a0stomach cancer.\nCancer cells in your stomach break down the protective lining, allowing acid to come into contact with your stomach wall.\n\n\nFor most people, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and infrequent, and does not require treatment from a healthcare professional.\nHowever, if you have indigestion regularly, or if it causes you severe pain or discomfort, see your pharmacist.\u00a0\nThey will ask about your indigestion symptoms, as well as:\n\nany other symptoms you have \u2013 which\u00a0may indicate an underlying health condition\nany medication you are taking \u2013 as some medications can cause indigestion\nyour lifestyle \u2013 as some lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol or being overweight, can cause indigestion\u00a0\n\nDepending on the type of indigestion symptoms you have, your pharmacist may recommend you see your GP to investigate your condition further. This is because indigestion can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition or health problem, such as a Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacterial infection.\nDetails of some of the further investigations you may have are outlined below.\nFurther investigations\nYou may be referred to hospital to have an endoscopy.\nAn endoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of your body using an endoscope \u2013 a thin, flexible tube, about the width of your little finger, with a light and a camera on one end. The camera is used to relay images of the inside of your body to a\u00a0TV monitor.\nAn endoscopy is not often needed to diagnose indigestion, but your GP may suggest that you have one if:\n\nthey need to examine the inside of your abdomen in more detail\nyou have had treatment for indigestion that has not worked\nyou have any\u00a0serious symptoms of indigestion\n\nRead more\u00a0about having an\u00a0endoscopy.\nTaking certain medicines for indigestion can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during an endoscopy. Therefore, for at least two weeks before your endoscopy, you will need to stop taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists.\nRead more about\u00a0treatments for indigestion.\nYour GP may also recommend changing other medications that may be causing your indigestion. However, only stop taking medication if you are advised to do so by your GP or another healthcare professional responsible for your care.\u00a0\nIf your GP thinks that your symptoms may be due to an infection with H pylori bacteria, you may need to have a test for it, such as:\n\na stool antigen test \u2013 a pea-sized stool (faeces) sample will be tested for H pylori bacteria\na breath test\na\u00a0blood test\u2013 a blood sample will be tested for antibodies to H pylori bacteria (antibodies are proteins produced by the body to fight infection)\n\nAntibiotics\u00a0and PPIs can affect the results of a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. Therefore, these tests may need to be delayed until two weeks after you last used a PPI, and four weeks after you last used an antibiotic.\nIf your GP thinks that your indigestion symptoms may be caused by another underlying medical condition, you may need to have some further tests to rule this out.\nFor example, abdominal pain and discomfort can also be caused by conditions affecting the bile ducts in your liver. Your bile ducts are a series of tubes that carry bile (fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) from the liver to the gallbladder (a pouch that holds bile) and the bowel. If your GP thinks that you may have such a condition, they may suggest you have a liver function test, which is a type of blood test used to assess how well your liver is working.\nYou may also need to have an abdominal ultrasound. An\u00a0ultrasound scan\u00a0uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body.\n\n\nTreatment for indigestion (dyspepsia) will vary, depending on what is causing it and how severe your symptoms are.\nIf you have been diagnosed with an underlying health condition, you may want to read our information on:\n\ntreating gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\ntreating a\u00a0stomach ulcer\n\nDiet and lifestyle changes\nIf you only have indigestion occasionally, you may not need to see your pharmacist or GP for treatment. It may be possible to ease your symptoms by making a few simple changes to your diet and lifestyle, summarised below.\nBeing overweight puts more pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to be pushed back up into your gullet (oesophagus). This is known as acid reflux, and is one of the most common causes of indigestion.\nIf you are overweight or obese, it is important to lose weight safely and steadily through regular exercise and by eating a healthy, balanced diet. Read advice on\u00a0losing weight.\nIf you smoke, the chemicals you inhale in cigarette smoke may contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle that separates your oesophagus from your stomach to relax, causing acid reflux.\nRead more about\u00a0quitting smoking, or speak to your GP or pharmacist. You can also call the\u00a0Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0service on 0800 84 84 84 (8.00am to 10.00pm, every day).\nMake a note of any particular food or drink that seems to make your indigestion worse, and avoid these if possible. This may mean:\n\neating less rich, spicy and fatty foods\ncutting down on drinks that contain caffeine \u2013 such as tea, coffee and cola\navoiding or cutting down on alcohol\n\nIf you tend to experience indigestion symptoms at night, avoid eating for three to four hours before you go to bed. Going to bed with a full stomach means there is an increased risk that acid in your stomach will be forced up into your oesophagus while you are lying down.\nWhen you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up or, ideally,\u00a0raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope that is created should help to prevent stomach acid moving up into your oesophagus while you are asleep.\nIf you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion.\nRead some\u00a0relaxation tips to relieve stress.\nChanging current medication\nYour pharmacist may recommend making changes to your current medication if they think it could be contributing to your indigestion.\nAs long as it is safe to do so, you may need to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Where required, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP to prescribe an alternative medication that will not cause indigestion. However, never stop taking any medication without consulting your pharmacist or GP first.\nImmediate indigestion relief\nIf you have indigestion that requires immediate relief, your pharmacist can advise you about the best way to treat this. As well as lifestyle changes and reviewing your current medication, your GP may prescribe or recommend:\n\nantacid medicines\nalginates\n\nThese are described in more detail below.\nAntacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief for mild to moderate symptoms of indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic), so that it no longer irritates the lining of your digestive system.\nAntacids are available in tablet and liquid form. You can buy them over the counter from most pharmacies without a prescription.\nThe effect of an antacid only lasts for a few hours at a time, so you may need to take more than one dose. Always follow the instructions on the packet to ensure you do not take too much.\nIt is best to take antacids when you are expecting symptoms of indigestion, or when they start to occur, such as:\n\nafter meals\nat bedtime\n\nThis is because antacids stay in your stomach for longer at these times and have more time to work. For example, if you take an antacid at the same time as eating a meal, it can work for up to three hours. In comparison, if you take an antacid on an empty stomach, it may only work for 20 to 60 minutes.\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0antacids, including possible interactions with other medicines and side effects.\nSome antacids also contain a medicine\u00a0called an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux.\nAcid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its lining. Alginates\u00a0form a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents, keeping stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus.\nYour pharmacist may suggest that you take an antacid that contains an alginate if you experience symptoms of acid reflux or if you have GORD.\nTake antacids containing alginates after eating, because this helps the medicine stay in your stomach for longer. If you take alginates on an empty stomach, they will leave your stomach too quickly to be effective.\nTreating persistent indigestion\nIf you have indigestion that is persistent or recurring, treatment with antacids and alginates may not be effective enough to control your symptoms. Your pharmacist may recommend a different type of medication, which will\u00a0be prescribed at the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms. Possible medications include:\n\nproton pump inhibitors (PPIs)\nH2-receptor antagonists\n\nThese are described in more detail below. Your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP who may also test you for the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria (see\u00a0Indigestion \u2013 diagnosis) and prescribe treatment for this if necessary.\nPPIs restrict the acid produced in your stomach.\nThe medication is\u00a0taken as tablets and if you are over 18, you can buy some types of PPIs over the counter in pharmacies, but these should only be used for short-term treatment. PPIs may enhance the effect of certain medicines. If you are prescribed a PPI, your progress will be monitored if you are also taking other medicines, such as:\n\nwarfarin \u2013 a medicine that stops the blood clotting\nphenytoin \u2013 a medicine to treat epilepsy\n\nIf your ingestion is persistent, your pharmacist might advise you to see your GP.\nIf your GP refers you for an endoscopy (a procedure that allows a surgeon to see inside your abdomen), you will need to stop taking a PPI at least 14 days before the procedure. This is because PPIs can hide some of the problems that would otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.\nPPIs can sometimes cause side effects. However, they are usually mild and reversible. These side effects may include:\n\nheadaches\ndiarrhoea\nconstipation\nfeeling sick (nausea)\nvomiting\nflatulence\nstomach pain\ndizziness\nskin rashes\n\nH2-receptor antagonists are another type of medication that your pharmacist or GP may suggest if antacids, alginates and PPIs have not been effective in controlling your indigestion. There are four H2-receptor antagonists:\n\ncimetidine\u00a0\nfamotidine\u00a0\nnizatidine\u00a0\nranitidine\u00a0\n\nThese medicines work by lowering the acidity level in your stomach.\nYour GP may prescribe any one of these four H2-receptor antagonists, although ranitidine is available from pharmacies under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. H2-receptor antagonists are usually taken in tablet form.\nAs with PPIs, you will need to stop taking H2-receptor antagonists at least 14 days before having an endoscopy if this has been arranged through your GP. This is\u00a0because they can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy.\nIf your indigestion symptoms are caused by an infection with H pylori bacteria, you will need to have treatment to clear the infection from your stomach. This should help relieve your indigestion, because the H pylori bacteria will no longer be increasing the amount of acid in your stomach.\nH pylori infection is usually treated using triple therapy (treatment with three different medications). Your GP will prescribe a course of treatment containing:\n\ntwo different antibiotics (medicines to treat infections that are caused by bacteria)\na PPI\n\nYou will need to take these medicines twice a day for seven days. You must follow the dosage instructions closely to ensure that the triple therapy is effective.\nIn up to 85% of cases, one course of triple therapy is effective in clearing an H pylori infection. However, you may need to have more than one course of treatment if it does not clear the infection the first time.\n\n\nIn most cases, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and only occurs occasionally. However, severe indigestion can cause complications, some of which are outlined below.\nOesophageal stricture\nIndigestion is often caused by acid reflux, which occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your gullet (oesophagus) and irritates its lining. If this irritation builds up over time, it can cause your oesophagus to become scarred. The scarring can eventually lead to your oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted (known as oesophageal stricture).\nIf you have oesophageal stricture, you may have symptoms such as:\n\ndifficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\nfood that becomes lodged in your throat\nchest pain\n\nOesophageal stricture is often treated using surgery to widen your oesophagus.\nPyloric stenosis\nLike oesophageal stricture, pyloric stenosis is caused by long-term irritation of the lining of your digestive system from stomach acid.\nPyloric stenosis occurs when the passage between your stomach and your small intestine (known as the pylorus) becomes scarred and narrowed. This causes vomiting and prevents any food you eat from being properly digested.\nIn most cases, pyloric stenosis is treated using surgery to return the pylorus to its proper width.\nBarrett\u2019s oesophagus\nRepeated episodes of\u00a0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\u00a0can lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barrett\u2019s oesophagus.\nIt is estimated that 1 in 10 people with GORD will develop Barrett\u2019s oesophagus. Most cases of Barrett\u2019s oesophagus first develop in people aged 50-70 years old. The average age at diagnosis is 62.\nBarrett\u2019s oesophagus does not usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those associated with GORD.\nThe concern is that Barrett\u2019s oesophagus is a pre-cancerous condition. This means that while changes in the cells are not cancerous, there is a small risk they could develop into \"full blown\" cancer in the future. This would then trigger the onset of\u00a0oesophageal cancer.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Insomnia is difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep for long enough to feel refreshed the next morning.\nIt's a common problem thought to regularly affect around one in every three people in the UK, and is particularly common in elderly people.\nIf you have insomnia, you may:\n\nfind it difficult to fall asleep\nlie awake for long periods at night\nwake up several times during the night\nwake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep\nnot feel refreshed when you get up\nfind it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired\nfeel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentrating\n\nOccasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time.\nPersistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life.

Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less.\nWhat's important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.\nYou're probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it's affecting your everyday life.\nWhat causes insomnia?\nIt's not always clear what triggers insomnia, but it's often associated with:\n\nstress and anxiety\na poor sleeping environment \u2013 such as an uncomfortable bed, or a bedroom that's too light, noisy, hot or cold\nlifestyle factors \u2013 such as jet lag, shift work, or drinking alcohol or caffeine before going to bed\nmental health conditions \u2013 such as\u00a0depression and schizophrenia\nphysical health conditions \u2013 such as heart problems,\u00a0other sleep disorders and long-term pain\ncertain medicines \u2013 such as some antidepressants,\u00a0epilepsy medicines and\u00a0steroid medication\n\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of insomnia\nWhat you can\u00a0do about it\nThere are a number of things you can try to help yourself get a good night's sleep if you have insomnia.\nThese include:\n\nsetting regular times for going to bed and waking up\nrelaxing before bed time\u00a0\u2013 try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music\nusing thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise\navoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals\u00a0and exercise for a few hours before going to bed\nnot watching TV or using phones, tablets or computers shortly before\u00a0going to bed\u00a0\nnot napping during the day\nwriting a list of your worries, and any ideas\u00a0about\u00a0how to\u00a0solve them, before going to bed to help you forget about\u00a0them until the morning\n\nSome people find over-the-counter sleeping tablets helpful, but they don't address the underlying problem and can have troublesome side effects.\nRead more\u00a0self-help tips for insomnia\nWhen to see your GP\nMake an appointment to see your GP if you're finding it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep and it's affecting your daily life \u2013 particularly if it has been a problem for a month or more and the above measures have not helped.\nYour GP may ask you about your sleeping routines, your daily alcohol and caffeine consumption, and your general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise.\nThey will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia.\nYour GP may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns.\nEach day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night.\nTreatments for\u00a0insomnia\nYour GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems.\nThey'll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep.\nIn some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended.\nThis is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. It's usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep.\nPrescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time.\nThis is because they don't treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time.\nRead more about treating insomnia\n\n\nInsomnia can be triggered by a number of possible factors, including worry and stress, underlying health conditions, and alcohol or drug use.\nSometimes it's not possible to identify a clear cause.\nStress and anxiety\nSome people develop insomnia after a stressful event, such as a bereavement, problems at work, or financial difficulties.\nThe problem can continue long after the event has passed because they start to associate going to bed with being awake. This develops into an anxiety about sleep itself.\nHaving more general worries\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, about work, family or health\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are also likely to keep you awake at night.\nThese can cause your mind to start racing while you lie in bed, which can be made worse by also worrying about not being able to sleep.\nPoor sleep routine and\u00a0sleeping environment\nYou may struggle to get a good night's sleep if you go to bed at inconsistent times, nap during the day, or don't \"wind down\" before going to bed.\nA poor sleeping environment can also contribute to insomnia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for instance, an uncomfortable bed or a bedroom that's too bright, noisy, hot or cold.\nLifestyle factors\nDrinking alcohol before going to bed and taking certain recreational drugs can affect your sleep, as can stimulants such as nicotine (found in cigarettes) and caffeine (found in tea, coffee and energy drinks). These should be avoided in the evenings.\nChanges to your sleeping patterns can also contribute to insomnia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, because of shift work or changing time zones after a long-haul flight (jet lag).\nMental health conditions\nUnderlying mental health problems can often affect a person's sleeping patterns, including:\n\nmood disorders \u2013 such as depression or bipolar disorder\nanxiety disorders\u2013 such as generalised anxiety, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder\npsychotic disorders \u2013 such as schizophrenia\n\nPhysical health\u00a0conditions\nInsomnia can also be caused by underlying physical conditions, including:\n\nheart conditions \u2013 such as\u00a0angina\u00a0or\u00a0heart failure\nrespiratory conditions \u2013 such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma\nneurological\u00a0conditions \u2013 such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease\nhormonal problems \u2013 such as an overactive thyroid\njoint or muscle problems \u2013 such as\u00a0arthritis\nproblems with the genital or urinary organs \u2013 such as urinary incontinence or an enlarged prostate\nsleep disorders \u2013 such as snoring and sleep apnoea, restless legs syndrome,\u00a0narcolepsy, night terrors and sleepwalking\nlong-term pain\n\nIn women, childbirth can sometimes lead to insomnia.\nMedication\nSome prescriptions or over-the-counter medications can cause insomnia as a side effect.\nThese include:\n\ncertain\u00a0antidepressants\nepilepsy medicines\nmedicines for high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers\nsteroid medication\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nstimulant medicines used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or narcolepsy\nsome medicines used to treat asthma, such as salbutamol, salmeterol and theophylline\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with any medication you're taking to see if insomnia or sleeping difficulties are listed as a possible side effect.\n\n\nInsomnia can often be improved by changing your daytime and bedtime habits or by improving your bedroom environment.\n\nMaking small changes may help you to get a good night's sleep. Try some of the methods below for a few weeks to see if they help.\nSee your GP if you're still having difficulty getting to sleep after trying these techniques.\nDaytime habits\n\nSet a specific time for getting up each day. Try to stick to this time, seven days a week, even if you feel you haven't had enough sleep. This should help you sleep better at night.\nDon't take a nap during the day.\nTake daily exercise, such as 30 minutes\u00a0walking or cycling. But don't exercise for at least four hours before going to bed, because this may make it more difficult to fall asleep.\n\nBedtime habits\n\nStop drinking tea and coffee for a few hours before bedtime.\nAvoid drinking alcohol and smoking, particularly shortly before going to bed.\u00a0\nDon't eat a big meal just before bedtime.\nOnly go to bed when you're feeling tired. If necessary, go to bed later than usual if it means you might be able to fall asleep more quickly.\nDon't use back-lit devices shortly before going to bed, including televisions, phones, tablets and computers.\nTry to create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a bath, listening to soft music, and drinking a warm, milky drink every night. These activities will be associated with sleep and will cause drowsiness.\nAvoid regularly using over-the-counter sleeping tablets. It is not clear how effective these are, they don't tackle the underlying problem, and have potential side effects. Read more about treatments for insomnia.\nDon't lie in bed feeling anxious about lack of sleep. Instead, get up, go to another room for about 20 minutes and do something else, such as reading or listening to soft music, before trying again.\nAvoid watching the clock because it will only make you anxious about how long it's taking you to fall asleep.\nWrite a list of your worries and any ideas to solve them before going to bed. This may help you forget about them until the morning.\n\nBedroom environment\n\nUse thick blinds or curtains or wear an eye mask if the early morning sunlight or bright street lamps affect your sleep.\nMake sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature for sleeping.\nWear ear plugs if noise is a problem.\nDon't use your bedroom for anything other than sleeping or sex. Avoid watching television, making phone calls, eating or working while you're in bed.\nMake sure your mattress is comfortable and that you have a pillow you like, as well as adequate bedding for the time of year.\n\n\n\nInsomnia will often improve by making changes to your bedtime habits. If these don't help, your GP may be able to recommend other treatments.\nIf you've had insomnia for more than four weeks, your GP may recommend cognitive and behavioural treatments or suggest a short course of prescription sleeping tablets as a temporary measure.\nIf it's possible to identify an underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties, treating this may be enough to return your sleep to normal.\nThe various treatments for\u00a0insomnia are outlined below.\u00a0\nGood sleeping habits\nYour GP will be able to advise you about what you can do at home to help you sleep. This is known as \"sleep hygiene\" and includes:\n\nestablishing fixed times for going to bed and waking up\ncreating a relaxing bedtime routine\nonly going to bed when you feel tired\nmaintaining a comfortable sleeping environment that's not too hot, cold, noisy or bright\nnot napping during the day\navoiding caffeine, nicotine and alcohol late at night\navoiding eating a heavy meal late at night\n\nRead more about self-help tips for\u00a0insomnia\nCognitive and behavioural treatments\nIf changing your sleeping habits doesn't help, your GP may be able to refer you for a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0that's specifically designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I).\nThe aim of\u00a0CBT-I is to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that may be contributing to your insomnia. It's\u00a0an effective treatment for many people and can have long-lasting results.\nCBT-I\u00a0may\u00a0include:\n\nstimulus-control therapy \u2013 which aims to help you associate the bedroom with sleep and establish a consistent sleep/wake pattern\nsleep restriction therapy \u2013 limiting the amount of time spent in bed to the actual amount of time spent asleep, creating mild sleep deprivation; sleep time is then increased as your sleeping improves\nrelaxation training \u2013 aims to reduce tension or minimise intrusive thoughts that may be interfering with sleep\nparadoxical intention \u2013 you try to stay awake and avoid any intention of falling asleep; it's used if you have trouble getting to sleep, but not maintaining sleep\nbiofeedback \u2013 sensors connected to a machine are placed on your body to measure your body's functions, such as muscle tension and heart rate; the machine produces pictures or sounds to help you recognise when you're not relaxed\u00a0\n\nCBT-I is\u00a0sometimes carried out by a specially trained GP. Alternatively, you may be referred to a clinical psychologist.\nThe therapy may be carried out in a small group with other people who have similar sleep problems, or one-to-one with a therapist. Self-help books and online courses may also be used.\nSleeping tablets\nSleeping tablets (hypnotics) are medications that encourage sleep. In the past, they were frequently used to help with insomnia, but they're used much less often nowadays.\nThey will generally only be considered:\n\nif your insomnia is severe\nas a temporary measure to help ease short-term insomnia\nif the good sleep habits and cognitive and behavioural treatments mentioned above don't help\n\nDoctors are usually reluctant to recommend sleeping tablets in the long-term because they just mask the symptoms without treating the underlying cause.\nThey can also cause potentially dangerous side effects, such as drowsiness the following morning, and some people become dependent on them.\nIf they are recommended, you should have the smallest effective dose possible for the shortest time (usually no more than two to four weeks).\u00a0\nA number of sleeping tablets are available to buy over the counter (OTC) from pharmacies. These are usually a type of\u00a0antihistamine medicine that causes you to feel drowsy.\nTaking OTC sleeping tablets regularly isn't usually recommended if you have insomnia, because it's not clear how effective they are, they don't tackle the underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties and they can cause side effects.\nIn particular, they can cause you to feel drowsy the next morning, which can make activities such as driving and operating machinery dangerous.\nSpeak to your GP for advice if you find yourself needing to take OTC sleeping tablets regularly.\nBenzodiazepines are prescription medicines that can reduce anxiety and promote calmness, relaxation and sleep. Your GP may prescribe them for a short time if you have severe insomnia or it's causing extreme distress.\nExamples of benzodiazepines include temazepam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, diazepam and nitrazepam.\nLong-term treatment with benzodiazepines isn't usually recommended because they can become less effective over time and some people become dependent upon them.\nThey can also cause a number of side effects, including:\n\ndrowsiness and\u00a0dizziness, which can persist into the next day\nfinding it difficult to concentrate or make decisions\ndepression\u00a0\nfeeling emotionally numb\nirritability\n\nYou should avoid driving if you feel drowsy, dizzy, or unable to concentrate or make decisions, as you may not be able to do so safely.\nZ\u2013drugs are a newer type of medicine that work in a similar way to benzodiazepines and are similarly effective. They include zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone.\nAs with benzodiazepines, long-term treatment with Z\u2013drugs isn't normally recommended because they can become less effective over time and some people become dependent on them.\nThey're usually only prescribed for a maximum of two to four weeks.\nSide effects of Z-drugs can include:\n\ndrowsiness and dizziness, which can persist into the next day\nfeeling and being sick\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nincreased\u00a0snoring and breathing problems during sleep\ndry mouth\nconfusion\n\nZ\u2013drugs can also sometimes cause psychiatric reactions, such as delusions,\u00a0nightmares and hallucinations. Contact your GP if you experience any of these effects.\nRead the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on\u00a0zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone for the short-term management of insomnia for more information.\nFor adults aged 55 or over, a medication called Circadin is sometimes used to help relieve insomnia for a few weeks. It contains a naturally occurring hormone called melatonin, which helps to regulate the sleep cycle.\nCircadin is usually only recommended for three weeks at first, but it can be continued for a total of 13 weeks if it helps.\nCommon side effects of Circadin include:\n\nheadaches\ncold-like symptoms\nback pain\njoint pain\n\nTreatments that aren't recommended\nThe following treatments aren't normally recommended for insomnia, because it's not clear how effective they are and they can sometimes cause side effects:\n\nantidepressants (unless you also have depression)\nchloral hydrate\nclomethiazole\nbarbiturates\nherbal remedies, such as valerian extract\ncomplementary and alternative therapies, such as\u00a0acupuncture, hypnotherapy and reflexology\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Iron deficiency anaemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells.\nIron is used to produce red blood cells, which\u00a0help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would.\nThere are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type.\nOther types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body\u00a0\u2013 read more about vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia.\nSymptoms of iron deficiency anaemia\nMany people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops.\nYou may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a stomach ulcer.\nThe most common symptoms\u00a0include:\n\ntiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)\nshortness of breath\nnoticeable heartbeats\u00a0(heart palpitations)\na pale complexion\n\nLess common symptoms\u00a0include:\n\nheadache\u00a0\nhearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source\u00a0(tinnitus)\nan altered sense of taste\nfeeling itchy\na sore or\u00a0abnormally smooth tongue\nhair loss\na desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica)\ndifficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\npainful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth\nspoon-shaped nails\n\nSee your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia. They should be able to diagnose the condition using a simple\u00a0blood test.\nRead more about diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia\nWhat causes iron deficiency anaemia?\nThere are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.\nThis can be caused by a stomach ulcer, stomach cancer, bowel cancer, or by taking\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nIn women\u00a0of reproductive age,\u00a0heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby\u00a0during pregnancy.\nUnless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you're more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.\nRead more about the causes of iron deficiency anaemia\nHow iron deficiency anaemia is treated\nTreatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to\u00a0boost the\u00a0low levels of\u00a0iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes\u00a0long-term problems.\nYou'll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal.\nThe underlying cause will need to be treated so you don't get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended.\nGood sources of iron include:\n\ndark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale\niron-fortified cereals or bread\nbrown rice\u00a0\npulses and beans\nnuts and seeds\nmeat, fish and\u00a0tofu\neggs\ndried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins\n\nRead more about treating iron deficiency anaemia\nFurther problems\nIf iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects\u00a0the body's natural defence system\u00a0(the immune system).\nSevere iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or\u00a0heart failure, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.\nPregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth.\nRead more about the complications of iron deficiency anaemia\n\n\nIron deficiency anaemia occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron, leading to the decreased production of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body.\nA lack of iron can be caused by several factors. Some of the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia are\u00a0outlined below.\nMonthly periods\nIn women of reproductive age,\u00a0periods are the\u00a0most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia.\nUsually, only women with heavy periods develop iron deficiency anaemia. If you have heavy bleeding over several consecutive menstrual cycles, it's known as menorrhagia.\nPregnancy\nIt's also very common for women to develop iron deficiency during pregnancy.\nThis is because your body needs extra iron\u00a0to ensure your baby has a sufficient blood supply and receives necessary oxygen and nutrients.\u00a0\nSome pregnant women require an iron supplement, while\u00a0others may need to increase the amount of iron in their diet.\nRead more about vitamins and minerals in pregnancy\nGastrointestinal blood loss\nThe gastrointestinal tract is the part of the body responsible for digesting food. It contains the stomach and intestines.\nBleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia in men, as well as women who've experienced the menopause (when monthly periods stop).\nMost people with gastrointestinal bleeding don't notice any obvious blood in their stools and don't experience any changes in their bowel habits.\nSome\u00a0causes of gastrointestinal bleeding are described below.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0can cause bleeding in the stomach. Ibuprofen and\u00a0aspirin are two commonly prescribed NSAIDs.\nIf your GP thinks your medication is causing gastrointestinal bleeding, they can prescribe a less harmful medicine. However, don't stop taking a medicine you've been prescribed unless your GP advises you to.\nThe acid in your stomach, which helps your body digest food, can sometimes eat into your stomach lining. When this happens, the acid forms an open sore (an ulcer). This is also known as a stomach ulcer or a peptic ulcer.\nStomach ulcers can cause the stomach lining to bleed, which can lead to anaemia. In some cases, the bleeding\u00a0can cause you to\u00a0vomit blood or pass blood in your stools. However, if the ulcer bleeds slowly, you may not\u00a0have any symptoms.\nIn\u00a0a few\u00a0cases, gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by cancer, usually stomach cancer or bowel cancer.\nWhen trying to establish the cause of anaemia, your GP will check for possible signs of cancer.\nIf your GP suspects cancer, you'll be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in treating digestive conditions) for a more thorough examination. This means that if cancer is found, it can be treated as quickly as possible.\nIf you're 60 years old or over and have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP\u00a0should refer you\u00a0to a specialist to rule out bowel cancer. Your\u00a0 appointment with the specialist should be within two weeks of your GP referring you.\nGastrointestinal bleeding can also be caused by a condition called angiodysplasia. This is\u00a0the result\u00a0of\u00a0abnormal, fragile superficial\u00a0blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding.\nChronic kidney disease\nPeople with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often develop iron deficiency anaemia.\nMost people with CKD who have iron deficiency anaemia will be given iron supplement injections, although daily tablets\u00a0may be\u00a0tried first.\nYou can read more about\u00a0treating anaemia in people with CKD\u00a0on the National Institute\u00a0for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website.\nOther causes\nOther conditions or actions that cause blood loss and may lead to iron deficiency anaemia include:\n\ninflammatory bowel disease\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes redness and swelling (inflammation) in the digestive system, such as Crohn's disease and\u00a0ulcerative colitis\u00a0\noesophagitis \u2013\u00a0inflammation of the gullet (oesophagus)\u00a0caused by stomach acid leaking through it\nschistosomiasis\u00a0\u2013 an infection caused by parasites, mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa\nblood donation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0donating a large amount of blood may lead to anaemia\ntrauma \u2013\u00a0a serious accident, such as a car crash, may cause you to lose a large amount of blood\u00a0\nnosebleeds\u00a0\u2013\u00a0having regular nosebleeds may lead to anaemia, although\u00a0this is rare\nhaematuria (blood in your urine) \u2013 but this rarely causes anaemia\u00a0and may be a symptom of another condition\n\nMalabsorption is when your body can't absorb iron from food, and is another possible cause of iron deficiency anaemia.\nThis may happen if you have coeliac disease, a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten, or surgery to remove all or part of your stomach (gastrectomy).\nUnless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused solely by a lack of iron in your diet.\nHowever, a lack of dietary iron can increase your risk of developing anaemia if you also have any of the conditions mentioned above.\nSome studies suggest vegetarians or vegans are more at risk of iron deficiency anaemia because of the lack of meat in their diet.\nIf you are vegetarian or vegan,\u00a0it is possible to gain enough iron by eating other types of food, such as:\n\nbeans\nnuts\ndried fruit, such as dried apricots\nwholegrains, such as brown rice\nfortified breakfast cereals\nsoybean flour\nmost dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale\n\nIf you're pregnant, you may need to increase the amount of iron-rich food you consume during pregnancy to help prevent iron deficiency anaemia.\nRead more about vegetarian and vegan diets\n\n\nSee your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath and heart palpitations.\nA simple blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis.\nYour GP may also carry out a physical examination and ask you a number of questions to help determine the cause of your anaemia.\nBlood test\nTo diagnose iron deficiency anaemia, a blood sample\u00a0is taken from a vein in your arm and a full blood count\u00a0is made. This means\u00a0all the different types of blood cells in the sample will be measured.\nIf you have anaemia:\n\nyour levels of haemoglobin\u00a0\u2013 a substance that transports oxygen\u00a0\u2013 will be lower than normal\nyou'll have fewer red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin, than normal\nyour red blood cells may be smaller and paler than usual\n\nYour GP may also test for a substance called ferritin, a protein that stores iron. If your ferritin levels are low, it means there isn't much iron stored in your body and you may\u00a0have iron deficiency anaemia.\nRead more about blood tests\u00a0\nIf your GP thinks your anaemia may be the result of a vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, the levels of these substances may be tested. Folate works with vitamin B12 to help your body produce red blood cells.\nVitamin B12 and folate deficiency\u00a0anaemia\u00a0is more common in people who are over the age of\u00a075.\nFinding the cause\nTo determine the underlying cause of your anaemia, your GP may ask questions about your lifestyle and medical history. For example, they may ask you about:\n\nyour diet \u2013\u00a0to see what you typically eat and whether this includes any iron-rich foods\nany medicines you take \u2013\u00a0to see if you've been regularly taking a type of medicine that can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines (gastrointestinal bleeding), such as\u00a0ibuprofen or\u00a0aspirin\nyour menstrual pattern \u2013\u00a0if you're a woman, your GP may ask if you've been experiencing particularly heavy periods\nyour family history \u2013\u00a0you'll be asked if your immediate family has anaemia or\u00a0a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or blood disorders\n\nIron\u00a0deficiency anaemia is common during pregnancy. If you're pregnant, your GP will usually only look for an alternative cause if a blood test has identified a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your symptoms or medical history suggest your anaemia may be caused by something else.\nPhysical examination\nA\u00a0physical examination will usually only be needed if the cause of your iron anaemia deficiency hasn't been identified by examining your medical history and asking you about your symptoms.\nIn such cases, your GP may:\n\nexamine your stomach (abdomen) to check for any physical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding\nlook for signs of\u00a0heart failure, such as\u00a0swollen ankles\u00a0\u2013\u00a0heart failure can have some similar symptoms to iron deficiency anaemia\n\nTwo other possible types of physical examination you may have are explained below.\nA\u00a0rectal examination is usually only needed if you're bleeding from your bottom. It's\u00a0a common procedure that can help your GP find out if there's something in your gastrointestinal tract that's causing bleeding.\nYour GP will insert a lubricated\u00a0gloved\u00a0finger into your bottom to feel for any abnormalities.\nA rectal examination isn't something to be embarrassed about, as it's a procedure your GP will be used to doing. It shouldn't cause significant pain, but it may cause some slight discomfort\u00a0\u2013 this will only last for a minute.\nWomen may have a pelvic examination if their GP thinks heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia.\nDuring a pelvic examination, your GP will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection.\nThey may also examine you internally. This will involve your GP inserting lubricated gloved fingers into your vagina to feel whether your\u00a0womb (uterus)\u00a0is tender or enlarged.\nA pelvic examination won't be carried out without your consent\u00a0(permission), and you can choose to have someone with you.\nReferral to a specialist\nIn some cases, your GP may refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in treating digestive conditions. They'll carry out a more thorough examination.\nFor example, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist if your GP can't identify a cause and you have a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your GP thinks there's a possibility your symptoms could be caused by stomach cancer or\u00a0bowel cancer, although this is unlikely.\nIf you're a woman with heavy periods, you may be referred to a gynaecologist if you don't respond to treatment with iron supplements.\n\n\nTreatment for iron deficiency anaemia usually involves taking iron supplements and changing your diet to increase your iron levels, as well as treating the underlying cause.\nIron supplements\nYour GP will prescribe an iron supplement to restore the iron missing from your body. The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate,\u00a0which is taken\u00a0as a tablet, usually twice a day.\nSome people can\u00a0experience side effects when taking iron supplements, including:\n\nabdominal (tummy) pain\nconstipation\u00a0or diarrhoea\nheartburn\nfeeling sick\nblack stools (faeces)\n\nThese side effects should settle down over time. However, your GP may recommend taking the tablets with food or shortly after eating if you have troublesome side effects.\nYour GP may also advise you to only take one or two tablets a day, instead of three, if you're finding side effects difficult to cope with.\nIf you can't take ferrous sulphate because you get severe side effects, you may be prescribed a different iron supplement called ferrous gluconate.\nThis supplement should cause fewer side effects because it contains a less concentrated dose of iron. However, it may take longer for the iron levels in your body to be restored.\nIn\u00a0a few\u00a0cases\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if you have chronic kidney disease (CKD)\u00a0\u2013 iron injections may be recommended instead of tablets.\nAs with all medications,\u00a0it's important to store iron supplements out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron supplements in a young child can be fatal.\nDietary advice\nIf a lack of iron in your diet is thought to be contributing to your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you how to up your intake.\nIron-rich foods include:\n\ndark-green leafy vegetables, such as\u00a0watercress and curly kale\niron-fortified cereals or bread\nbrown rice\u00a0\npulses and beans\u00a0\nnuts and seeds\nwhite and red meat\u00a0\nfish\u00a0\ntofu\neggs\u00a0\ndried fruit,\u00a0such as\u00a0dried apricots, prunes and raisins\n\nYour diet should include foods from all the major food groups to ensure it's\u00a0healthy and balanced. In particular,\u00a0food and drink containing vitamin C\u00a0are important\u00a0as vitamin C helps your body absorb iron.\nHowever, consuming large amounts of some foods and drinks, as well as certain\u00a0medicines,\u00a0may make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include:\n\ntea and coffee\ncalcium\u00a0\u2013\u00a0found in\u00a0dairy products, such as milk\u00a0\nantacids\u00a0and\u00a0proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0medications used\u00a0to relieve indigestion\nwholegrain cereals\u00a0\u2013\u00a0although wholegrains are a good source of iron themselves, they contain phytic acid, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and pills\n\nYou may be referred to a nutrition specialist called a dietitian if you're finding it difficult to include iron in your diet. They'll be able to give you detailed, personalised advice about how you can\u00a0improve your diet.\nTreating the underlying cause\nYour GP will also need to ensure\u00a0the underlying cause of your anaemia is treated so\u00a0it doesn't happen again.\nFor example, if\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are causing bleeding in your stomach, your GP may prescribe a different medicine to help minimise the risk of stomach bleeding.\nHeavy periods can\u00a0be treated with\u00a0medication or \u2013\u00a0in particularly severe cases \u2013\u00a0surgery.\nMonitoring\nYour GP will ask you to return two to four weeks after you've started taking\u00a0iron supplements to check how well you've responded to the treatment. You'll have a\u00a0blood test\u00a0to check your haemoglobin levels.\nIf your\u00a0blood test results show an improvement, you'll be asked to continue taking iron supplements and return in two to four\u00a0months for another blood test.\nOnce your haemoglobin levels and red blood cells are normal, your GP will usually recommend continuing to\u00a0take iron supplements for three months to help build up the iron levels in your body.\nAfter this, you should be able to stop taking the supplements, depending on the cause of your iron deficiency anaemia. Your condition will be monitored every three months over the course of a year, and again a year later.\nSometimes after a person's iron levels have been replenished, they start to fall again.\nThis could happen if you don't get enough iron in your diet, you're pregnant, or you have consistently heavy periods.\nIn such cases, you may be prescribed an ongoing iron supplement to help stop your anaemia returning. This will usually be a tablet, which you'll have to take once a day.\u00a0\nIf your iron levels don't improve, your GP will ask how regularly you've been taking your iron supplements.\nSome people are put off taking the medication because of the side effects. However, your condition won't improve if you don't take the supplements.\nIf you've been taking the supplements as prescribed and your iron levels still haven't improved, your GP may refer you to a specialist for an assessment.\n\n\nIron deficiency anaemia rarely causes serious or long-term complications, although some people with the condition find it affects their daily life.\nSome\u00a0common complications are outlined below.\nTiredness\nIron deficiency anaemia can make you feel tired and lacking in energy (lethargic). This may result in you being less productive at work, and\u00a0you may find it difficult to stay awake\u00a0or\u00a0not feel able to exercise regularly.\nIncreased risk of infections\nResearch has shown\u00a0iron deficiency anaemia can affect your immune system\u00a0\u2013 the body's natural defence system. This increases your vulnerability to infection.\nHeart and lung problems\nAdults with severe anaemia may be at risk of developing complications that affect their heart or lungs.\nFor example, you may develop tachycardia, which is\u00a0an abnormally fast heartbeat,\u00a0or\u00a0heart failure, where the heart fails to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.\nPregnancy complications\nPregnant women with severe anaemia have an increased risk of developing complications, particularly during and after birth.\nThey may also develop\u00a0postnatal depression, which some women experience after having a baby.\nResearch suggests babies born to mothers who have untreated anaemia are more likely to:\n\nbe born prematurely\u00a0\u2013\u00a0before the 37th week of pregnancy\nhave a low birth weight\nhave problems with\u00a0iron levels themselves\ndo less well in mental ability tests\n\nRestless legs syndrome\nSome cases of\u00a0restless legs syndrome are thought to be caused by iron deficiency anaemia. Doctors often refer to this as secondary restless legs syndrome.\nRestless legs syndrome\u00a0is a common condition that affects the nervous system, and\u00a0causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs. It also causes an unpleasant feeling in the feet, calves and thighs.\nRestless legs syndrome caused by iron deficiency anaemia\u00a0can usually be treated with iron supplements.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Itchy bottom (pruritus ani) is characterised by a strong urge to scratch the skin around your anus.\nThe anus is the opening at the lower end of the digestive system, where solid waste leaves your\u00a0body.\nCauses of itchy bottom\nAs itchy bottom is a symptom rather than a condition itself.

Check with your GP or pharmacist about how long you should use them for.\nIf your itchy bottom is caused by an underlying condition, such as a\u00a0bacterial infection or piles, it will also need to be treated.\nRead more\u00a0about treating an\u00a0itchy bottom.\nComplications of itchy bottom\nFrequently scratching your bottom may damage or tear the delicate skin around your anus. This may\u00a0lead to\u00a0problems such as:\n\nthick and leathery skin (lichenification)\nsore and broken down skin (ulceration)\nthe top layer of skin being worn away (excoriation)\ninfection\n\nThe earlier these complications are diagnosed and treated, the quicker you'll recover.\u00a0\nIf the cause of your itchy bottom can't be identified and treated, it may last for long periods of time (known as chronic itchy bottom).\n\n\nThe cause of itchy bottom isn't always known. However, it can sometimes be a symptom of another problem or underlying condition.\nInfection\nAn itchy bottom may be a sign\u00a0that your body is trying to deal with an infection. The infection may be:\n\nbacterial \u2013 such as the streptococcal bacteria that causes streptococcal infections, or the staphylococcal bacteria that causes staphylococcal infections\nfungal \u2013 such as the Candida albicans fungus that causes\u00a0vaginal thrush\u00a0(itching, irritation and swelling of the vagina and surrounding area)\nparasitic \u2013 such as\u00a0threadworms (small worm parasites that infect the intestines), or\u00a0scabies (tiny mites that burrow into the skin)\nviral \u2013 such as the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores\n\nAn itchy bottom can sometimes\u00a0be a symptom of a\u00a0sexually transmitted infection (STI).\nIf you've had unprotected sex and think you could have an STI, visit your local\u00a0sexual health clinic. They\u00a0can offer advice and provide testing\u00a0and treatment.\nGastrointestinal conditions\nGastrointestinal conditions affect your digestive tract (your mouth, throat, stomach, intestines and anus).\nGastrointestinal conditions that may cause an itchy bottom include:\n\nhaemorrhoids (piles) \u2013 swellings in and around your anus\u00a0that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels\nanal fistula \u2013 where a small channel (tract) develops between your anal canal (the last section of the large intestine) and the surface of your skin, near the anus\nanal fissure \u2013 a tear or ulcer (open sore) that develops in the lining of the anal canal\nsphincter incompetence \u2013 where the sphincter (the ring of muscle that opens and closes your anus) stops working properly, causing\u00a0bowel incontinence\nlong-term\u00a0diarrhoea \u2013 passing loose, watery stools\nlong-term\u00a0constipation \u2013 an inability to completely empty your bowels\n\nSkin conditions\nSome skin conditions can affect any area of skin on your\u00a0body, including the skin around your anus.\nSkin conditions that can be associated with an itchy bottom include:\n\npsoriasis \u2013 where red, flaky, crusty patches of skin develop\u00a0because your skin cells reproduce too quickly\ncontact dermatitis \u2013 where your skin reacts to certain substances (allergens), causing it to become inflamed\nlichen\u00a0sclerosus \u2013 a long-term skin disorder that causes itchy or sore white spots to develop on the skin around the genitals\natopic eczema \u2013 where your skin becomes dry, red and flaky\n\nSystemic conditions\nSystemic conditions affect your whole body and can sometimes make your bottom feel itchy. Systemic conditions include:\n\ndiabetes\u00a0\u2013 a lifelong condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high\nkidney failure \u2013 where your kidneys stop working properly\niron deficiency anaemia \u2013 a decrease in the number of red, oxygen-carrying blood cells, causing tiredness and a lack of energy (lethargy)\u00a0\noveractive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) \u2013 too much thyroid hormone in your body\n\nMedication\nSome types of medication, including those applied directly to your skin (topical),\u00a0may make your bottom feel itchy.\nFor example, if you use a cream to treat haemorrhoids,\u00a0it may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus and make the itching worse.\nSome topical medicines may\u00a0also cause contact dermatitis\u00a0(red, itchy skin) if used for long periods.\nMedicines that may\u00a0cause an itchy bottom or make your symptoms worse include:\n\npeppermint oil \u2013 which is sometimes used to help relieve stomach\u00a0cramps\nlong-term use of\u00a0local anaesthetics \u2013 medicines that numb a specific part of your body\nglyceryl trinitrate \u2013 which\u00a0is often prescribed as a topical cream to treat anal fissures, and may cause\u00a0itching\u00a0\nlong-term use of topical corticosteroids \u2013 medicines applied directly to the skin to help reduce inflammation\n\nIf a medicine you're taking is causing an itchy bottom, your bottom should itch\u00a0less after you've completed the\u00a0course of medication.\nAnal and bowel cancer\nIn rare cases, itchy bottom can be a symptom of a gastrointestinal cancer, such as anal cancer or bowel cancer.\nMost cases of itchy bottom aren't caused by cancer, but it's important that your GP rules out all possibilities.\nPossible symptoms of anal cancer include:\n\nrectal bleeding\npain\nitching\nsmall lumps that develop around the anus\n\nPossible\u00a0symptoms of bowel cancer include:\n\nbleeding from the back passage\nblood in your stools\na change in your normal bowel habits, such as diarrhoea that lasts longer than 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks\n\n\n\nTreatment for itchy bottom usually involves following simple self-care measures for a few months. If necessary, medication may be prescribed to help ease the symptoms.\nIf you still have an itchy bottom after 2 months, or if it returns, you may need to follow this self-care advice for longer.\nKeeping clean and dry\nIf you have an\u00a0itchy bottom, you should keep your bottom as clean and dry as possible.\nThe best way to do this is to\u00a0use water to gently clean your anus and the surrounding skin. Clean your bottom in\u00a0this way after every bowel movement\u00a0and before going to bed each night.\nYou can\u00a0use soap to clean your bottom, but make sure it's mild and\u00a0unperfumed so\u00a0it causes less irritation to your skin. Wash all of the soap away afterwards.\nAfter washing, gently\u00a0dry your bottom. Avoid rubbing the area vigorously, as this may irritate your\u00a0skin. Instead, gently pat the skin dry using a soft towel. You can also dry your bottom\u00a0using a hairdryer on a low heat setting.\nWhen you're away from home, you can use damp toilet paper\u00a0after passing stools, before gently patting your bottom dry.\nIf you\u00a0have a tendency to\u00a0sweat, or if\u00a0your bottom becomes very moist, putting a cotton tissue in your underwear will\u00a0help\u00a0absorb the moisture around your anal area.\nDiet\nSome\u00a0foods may\u00a0make your itchy bottom worse. If\u00a0the urge to scratch your bottom is greater after eating certain foods, try cutting them out of your diet completely or reducing the amount you eat.\nFoods that may make your itchy bottom worse include:\n\ntomatoes\nspicy foods\ncitrus fruits, such as oranges\nnuts\nchocolate\ndairy products\ncoffee\nexcessive amounts of liquids, such as milk, beer or wine\u00a0\n\nFibre\nYour GP may recommend that you follow a diet that keeps your stools regular and well-formed.\u00a0\nThis means\u00a0your stools\u00a0won't be loose (runny), but you won't need to strain when you go to the toilet.\nLoose stools can irritate\u00a0your anus. Straining to pass\u00a0hard stools may cause haemorrhoids (piles)\u00a0to develop. Piles are swellings\u00a0that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels in and around your anus.\nIncluding more fibre in your diet will make your stools softer and easier to pass. Fibre can be\u00a0found in:\n\ngrains \u2013 such as wholegrain bread\npulses \u2013 edible seeds that grow in a pod, such as peas, beans and lentils\noats \u2013 which are in some breakfast cereals\nfruit and vegetables\n\nMedication\nWhile waiting for the above self-care measures to take effect, your GP may prescribe medication to help ease your itchy bottom.\nHowever, you shouldn't use\u00a0topical treatments (those applied directly\u00a0to your skin)\u00a0for more\u00a0than 2\u00a0weeks, because they may start to harm your skin if used for long periods.\nYour GP may prescribe an ointment or cream to soothe the skin around your anus. You'll usually have to apply it in the\u00a0morning and\u00a0at night, as well as\u00a0after each\u00a0bowel movement.\nIf the skin around your anus is\u00a0sore and inflamed due to itching, your GP may prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid (an ointment that contains steroids). Applying this directly to the affected area will help relieve the inflammation and ease the urge to scratch.\nIn most cases, using a\u00a0topical corticosteroid will help ease the itch. However, it can sometimes make the\u00a0itching worse. Speak to your GP immediately if your itchy bottom gets worse after using topical corticosteroids.\nIf your sleep is disturbed due\u00a0to\u00a0itching at night, using an antihistamine may help.\nAntihistamines\u00a0are medicines that work by counteracting the action of histamine (a chemical released during an allergic reaction). Some antihistamines also have a sedating effect (they make you drowsy).\nYour GP\u00a0may prescribe\u00a0chlorphenamine or hydroxyzine. These should be taken at night and shouldn't be used for longer than 2\u00a0weeks, because after this time the sedating effect may no longer work.\nYou need to be aware that sedating antihistamines can affect your ability to drive or operate machinery, and\u00a0the sedating effect may be stronger if you drink\u00a0alcohol.\nTreating an underlying cause of itchy bottom\nWhen diagnosing itchy bottom,\u00a0your GP will try to determine an underlying cause.\nIf they identify the cause, such as a bacterial infection or skin condition, it\u00a0will also need to be treated\u00a0for your itchy bottom to be properly managed.\nFor example, a bacterial infection may need to be treated with antibiotics. If the underlying cause is left untreated, your itchy bottom may return.\nAn itchy bottom\u00a0in children is often caused by worms. If treatment for worms is recommended, other family members with the same symptom should also be treated.\nFurther treatment for an itchy bottom\nGo back to your GP if your itchy bottom doesn't improve after\u00a0following self-care measures, such as keeping your bottom clean and dry, and using medication to provide relief from the itching.\nYour GP may then refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) or a colorectal surgeon (who specialises in conditions that affect the large intestine and anus).\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in adults in the UK.\nSigns and symptoms of kidney cancer can include:\n\nblood in your urine\u00a0\na constant pain in your side, just below the ribs\na lump or swelling in the kidney area (on either side of the body)\n\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you experience any of these symptoms. They will examine you and may refer you to a specialist clinic for further tests.\nIn around half of all cases of kidney cancer, there are no symptoms, and the condition is detected during tests for other unrelated conditions.\nRead more about the symptoms of kidney cancer\u00a0and diagnosing kidney cancer.\nThe kidneys and cancer\nThe kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just underneath the ribcage.\nTheir main role is to filter out waste products from the blood, in addition to producing urine. Only 1 of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer.\nThe human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.\nExactly what triggers this growth\u00a0is unknown. However, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such as\u00a0smoking and obesity.\nKidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men.\nRead more about the causes of kidney cancer.\nTypes of kidney cancer\nMany different types of cancer can affect the kidneys. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of all kidney cancers.\nRarer types of kidney cancer include:\n\ntransitional cell cancer \u2013 develops in the lining of the kidneys and usually affects men who are 50 years of age or over\nWilms\u2019 tumour \u2013 a rare type of kidney cancer that affects children\n\nThis topic focuses on RCC. Read the\u00a0Cancer Research UK website for more information about transitional cell cancer and Wilms\u2019 tumour.\nTreating kidney cancer\nThe earlier kidney cancer is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.\nHow it's treated will depend on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery to remove the cancerous cells is usually the first course of action.\nUnlike most other cancers,\u00a0chemotherapy isn't very effective at treating kidney cancer. However, non-surgical treatments are available, such as\u00a0radiotherapy or targeted therapies. These are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney.\nRead more about treating kidney cancer.\nPreventing kidney cancer\nAs the causes of kidney cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to fully prevent it.\nHowever, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. A combination of a\u00a0healthy diet and\u00a0regular exercise will help to avoid becoming overweight or obese, which is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.\nIf you're overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a calorie-controlled diet.\nRead more about treating obesity.\n\n\nMost cases of kidney cancer don't cause any symptoms in the early stages.\nThe most common symptoms of mid- to advanced-stage kidney cancer are:\n\nblood in your urine (haematuria) \u2013 the amount of blood is usually high enough to change the colour of your urine to a reddish or dark brown colour\na\u00a0persistent\u00a0pain in your side, just below the ribs\na lump or swelling in the area of your\u00a0kidneys (on either side of the body)\n\nHowever, in around half of all cases, the cancer causes no symptoms and is only detected during a routine ultrasound scan.\nLess common symptoms of kidney cancer include:\n\nextreme tiredness (fatigue) or anaemia\nunintentional weight loss\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\nnight sweats\u00a0\na general sense of feeling unwell\nswelling of the veins in the testicles (in men)\nloss of appetite\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSpeak to your GP immediately if you have pain or a swelling or lump in your kidney area (on either side of your body, just below your ribcage).\nYou should also speak to your GP if you\u00a0have blood in your urine. Although it's highly unlikely to be caused by kidney cancer, it could\u00a0be\u00a0a symptom of a less serious condition that still requires treatment, such as a\u00a0kidney stone or bladder stone.\n\n\nThe exact cause of kidney cancer is unknown, but there are risk factors that can increase the chances of developing the condition.\nThe\u00a03\u00a0main risk factors for kidney cancer are:\n\nobesity\nsmoking\nfamily history and genetics\n\nObesity\nObesity is\u00a0a significant risk factor for kidney cancer.\nThere's a strong link between someone\u2019s\u00a0body mass index (BMI) and their risk of developing kidney cancer. Read more about\u00a0how BMI is calculated,\u00a0and work out your BMI.\u00a0\nA BMI score of 25 or above has been shown to increase a person's chances of developing kidney cancer. Those with a BMI score of 30 or above are at particularly high risk.\nThis may be because overweight or obese people, particularly women, have higher levels of a hormone called oestrogen in their body. It's thought that excess levels of oestrogen may stimulate the growth of cancerous cells.\nCases of kidney cancer have been increasing over the last 40 years, which has been linked to rising obesity levels.\nSmoking\nSmoking is also a\u00a0significant risk factor for developing kidney cancer, and the more you smoke the greater the risk.\nFor example, research has shown that if you regularly smoke 10 cigarettes a day, you're one-and-a-half times\u00a0more likely to develop kidney cancer compared to a non-smoker. This increases to twice as likely\u00a0if you smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day.\nIt's not clear why smoking increases your chances of developing kidney cancer.\nFamily history and genetics\nIf you have a close family member (parents, brothers, sisters or a child) who's been diagnosed with kidney cancer, you're about twice as likely to develop kidney cancer yourself.\nExamples of inherited genetic conditions and syndromes that increase your risk of developing kidney cancer include:\n\ntuberous sclerosis \u2013 a rare genetic condition that causes multiple non-cancerous (benign) tumours to grow in the body; it\u2019s autosomal dominant, which means you only have to inherit the faulty gene from one parent to get it; about 1 in every 100 people with tuberous sclerosis will develop kidney cancer\nhereditary papillary kidney cancer \u2013 a rare form of cancer caused by faulty genes inherited from your parents; it\u2019s autosomal dominant and causes small, slow-growing, cancerous tumours to develop in the kidneys, which can sometimes spread\nhereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) \u2013 a rare, autosomal dominant form of cancer, where cancerous tumours develop from smooth muscle tissue (leiomyomatas); people with HLRCC have a 10\u00a0to 16% increased risk of developing kidney cancer\nVon Hippel-Lindau syndrome \u2013 a rare genetic syndrome that causes small non-cancerous tumours to develop inside the nervous system; VHL is also autosomal dominant and about 4 out of 10 people who have it develop kidney cancer\nBirt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome \u2013 an inherited syndrome that causes non-cancerous tumours to develop in the hair follicles of the skin; they usually occur on the face, neck and torso\n\nOther\u00a0possible risk factors\nThere are also a\u00a0number of other possible risk factors for developing kidney cancer, including:\n\nmild painkillers \u2013 some mild painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of developing kidney cancer; NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may slightly increase the risk, although occasional use or low doses are unlikely to be harmful\nkidney disease \u2013 if you have kidney failure and need to have regular\u00a0dialysis (treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys), your risk of developing kidney cysts and kidney cancer is increased\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension) \u2013 high blood pressure is a known risk factor for kidney disease, and you're up to twice as likely to develop kidney cancer if you have raised blood pressure\n\n\n\nIn many cases, kidney cancer is diagnosed after routine scans and check-ups, as the condition doesn't always have obvious symptoms.\nYou should speak to your GP if you have any symptoms of kidney cancer,\u00a0such as\u00a0blood in your urine or a constant pain below your ribs.\nYour GP will examine you and, if they think your symptoms need further assessment, refer you to a specialist urologist (a doctor who\u00a0specialises in\u00a0conditions that affect the urinary tract).\nIf you notice blood in your urine,\u00a0your GP will usually\u00a0carry out a\u00a0blood test and take a urine sample. The results will help rule out other\u00a0possible causes, such as infection or kidney stones.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of\u00a0renal (kidney) cancer\u00a0and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected\u00a0kidney cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nIf you need to be referred urgently, you'll usually be seen within 2 weeks.\nFurther tests\nIf your GP refers you to a hospital specialist,\u00a0further tests will help\u00a0determine whether you have kidney cancer.\nAn\u00a0ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of an organ in the body. It can often detect changes in the shape of the kidney that might be\u00a0caused by\u00a0a cancerous tumour.\nAn ultrasound scan may be needed if the cause of the blood in your urine can't be found.\nYou may also be referred for a\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, a series of detailed images of the inside of your body are taken and put together by a computer.\nIf you have a CT scan, you may be given a special dye to drink, or it may be injected. The dye makes the results of the CT scan clearer.\nIn some cases of kidney cancer, an image-guided biopsy is carried out. It's a minor surgical procedure performed under local anaesthetic.\u00a0This means you'll be awake during the procedure, but the\u00a0area surrounding the affected kidney will be numbed, so that you don't feel anything.\nDuring an image-guided biopsy, a radiologist or surgeon will use an ultrasound or CT scan to guide a needle through your skin and into your kidney. A small tissue sample will be removed from your kidney and examined under a microscope to check for cancerous cells.\nYou may also need to have a\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which can be used to\u00a0produce detailed images of your kidneys. The images can help identify a tumour and determine\u00a0its size.\nA\u00a0cystoscopy is a medical procedure that uses an instrument called a cystoscope to examine the\u00a0inside of your bladder and urinary system.\nThis procedure\u00a0doesn't look at\u00a0the kidneys, but it can rule out or confirm whether any bleeding is coming from problems in the bladder.\nAn intravenous pyelogram (IVP) test involves injecting a dye into your bloodstream.\u00a0X-rays are taken after a short time, with the dye highlighting any growths present in the kidneys.\nStaging and grading\nIf kidney cancer is confirmed, it's usually possible to determine its grade and stage.\nThe stage describes how far the cancer has spread, and the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how quickly it's likely to spread.\nBoth the stage and grade of your kidney cancer will help determine your recommended treatment and the likelihood of achieving a cure.\nHealthcare professionals use the TNM system\u00a0to stage kidney cancer:\n\nT \u2013 indicates how large the tumour has grown (a tumour is a lump of cancerous tissue)\nN \u2013 indicates whether nearby lymph nodes are affected (lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands found throughout the body, which help protect against infection)\nM \u2013 indicates whether the cancer has spread to another part of the body (M stands for metastases, which is the medical term for cancer that has spread)\n\nThe stages of tumour size are:\n\nT1a \u2013 where the tumour is less than 4cm (about 1.6 inches)\u00a0in diameter\nT1b \u2013 where the tumour is 4\u00a0to 7cm (about 1.6-2.8 inches) in diameter\nT2 \u2013 where the tumour is larger than 7cm (2.8 inches)\u00a0in diameter, but hasn't spread out of the kidney\nT3a \u2013 where the tumour has spread into the adrenal gland or the layer of fat surrounding the kidney\nT3b \u2013 where the tumour has spread into the renal vein (the vein that carries blood back from the kidney to the heart) or into the vena cava (the vein that carries blood back from the top half of the body)\nT3c \u2013 where the tumour has spread past the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the top part of the abdomen from the bottom part)\nT4 \u2013 where the tumour has spread beyond the tough layer of tissue that surrounds and protects the kidney\n\nThere are 3 lymph node stages:\n\nN0 \u2013 where no lymph nodes have been affected\nN1 \u2013 where there are cancer cells in 1 lymph node\nN2 \u2013 where there are cancer cells in 2 or more lymph nodes\n\nM0 means that the cancer hasn't spread to another part of the body. M1 means that the cancer has spread.\nKidney cancer is graded using a scale of one to four. The higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer.\nCoping with cancer\nBeing diagnosed with cancer can be very distressing, particularly if it's incurable. The news can often be difficult to take in and comprehend.\nAfter cancer has been diagnosed, you may find that talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist helps you deal with\u00a0feelings of depression and anxiety. Antidepressants may also be used to help you through this process.\nRead more about coping with a cancer diagnosis. More information can be found on our pages about\u00a0living with cancer.\n\n\nThe treatment of kidney cancer depends on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery is the most common first course of action, with the aim of removing the cancer cells.\nUnlike most other cancers, chemotherapy isn't very effective in treating kidney cancer. However, there are non-surgical treatments available, such as radiotherapy or targeted drug therapies.\nThe main treatments for kidney cancer include:\n\nnephrectomy\nembolisation\nradiotherapy\u00a0\ntargeted therapies\u00a0\nimmunotherapy\n\nYour treatment plan\nYou can expect to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising a specialist cancer surgeon, an oncologist (who specialises in radiotherapy and chemotherapy), a radiologist, a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) and a specialist nurse.\nYou'll be\u00a0given a key worker, usually\u00a0the specialist nurse, who will be responsible for coordinating your care.\nYour team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nWhen deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:\n\nthe\u00a0stage and grade of your cancer (how big it is and how far it's spread)\nyour age and general health\n\nIf the cancer hasn't spread out of your kidney (T1 or T2 kidney cancer), it can usually be cured by removing some or all of the kidney.\nIf the cancer has spread out of your kidney (T3 or T4 kidney cancer), a complete cure may not be possible. However, it should be possible to slow the cancer's progression and treat any symptoms.\nSurgical treatments\nA nephrectomy is an operation to remove a kidney.\nIf the tumour is less than 4cm (1.5 inches) in diameter, it may only be necessary to remove some of your kidney. This is known as a partial nephrectomy. A partial nephrectomy may also be required if your remaining kidney is in poor health.\nIf the tumour is more than 4cm in diameter, your entire kidney will need to be removed. Even if the cancer has spread beyond your kidney, you may still benefit from having your kidney removed.\nRemoving the kidney can help resolve the pain, and make other types of non-surgical treatment more effective.\nIt's possible to live a normal life with only 1 kidney, because the other kidney will be able to compensate.\nDuring a nephrectomy, the surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hasn't spread beyond the kidney.\nThere are 2 ways that both a partial and open nephrectomy can be performed They are an:\n\nopen nephrectomy \u2013 where the kidney is removed through a large incision in your abdomen (stomach)\nlaparoscopic or keyhole nephrectomy \u2013 where\u00a0a series of smaller incisions are made in your abdomen, and the kidney is removed using small surgical instruments\n\nBoth techniques have advantages and disadvantages.\nA laparoscopic nephrectomy has a considerably quicker recovery time than an open nephrectomy.\nHowever, the procedure requires surgeons with specialised training, so you may have to wait longer to receive treatment than you would if you\u00a0decided to have an open nephrectomy.\nSome types of kidney cancer, where the tumour is located in the centre of the kidney, may not be suitable for a laparoscopic nephrectomy.\nOne of the main disadvantages of an open nephrectomy is that it's a major surgical procedure that can place a considerable strain on the body. This means it may not be suitable for people who are particularly frail or unwell.\nYou should discuss the pros and cons of both procedures with your surgical team.\nIf you're unable to have a nephrectomy, you may benefit from an alternative\u00a0operation known as embolisation.\nDuring embolisation, the surgeon will insert a small tube called a catheter into your groin, then use\u00a0X-ray images to guide the catheter into the blood supply of your kidney. A substance will then be injected through the catheter to block the blood supply to your kidney.\nBy blocking blood supply to the kidney, any tumours that are present will become starved of oxygen and nutrients, causing them to shrink.\nNon-surgical treatments for advanced kidney cancer\nKidney cancer is one of the few types of cancer that's less responsive to chemotherapy (where powerful medication is used to kill cancerous cells).\nHowever, a number of\u00a0clinical trials are underway that are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medications that appear to be benefiting some people.\nThere are also a number of different non-surgical treatments that can slow the spread of the cancer and help control its symptoms.\nRadiotherapy\u00a0can't usually cure kidney cancer, but it can\u00a0slow down its progress and help reduce pain. You should only need a few minutes of radiotherapy every day, for a number of days.\nWhen radiotherapy is used to control the symptoms of cancer rather than cure it, the side effects tend to be mild. Possible side effects may include fatigue (tiredness), nausea and vomiting.\nCryotherapy involves killing cancer cells by freezing them. It may be\u00a0used if a person isn't fit enough for surgery, or if their tumour is small.\nCryotherapy is usually classed as either percutaneous (where needles are\u00a0passed through the skin) or laparoscopic (where needles are placed directly into the kidney through a small incision).\nSide effects include bleeding around the kidney and injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses heat generated by radio waves to kill cancer cells. This is a percutaneous treatment, meaning no incision is needed.\nThis treatment is only available at specialist centres. It's mainly used if you're not strong enough for surgery or your kidney cancer is in the early stages.\nRFA\u00a0can't be used if the cancer is too close to other organs, such as the bowel.\nSide effects include bleeding in the treatment area, a collection of blood (haematoma) near the kidney, and problems passing urine due to the narrowing of the tube that joins the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).\nTargeted therapies\nA number of\u00a0new medicines have been developed for the treatment of kidney cancer. These are:\n\nsunitinib\u00a0\npazopanib\naxitinib\nsorafenib\ntemsirolimus\neverolimus\nbevacizumab\n\nThese medicines are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they're designed to target and interrupt the functions needed by cancer to grow and spread.\nAt present, only sunitinib, pazopanib and axitinib\u00a0have been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). They're available on the NHS for people who are still relatively healthy and have advanced kidney cancer, or kidney cancer that's spread to other parts of their body.\nSorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus and bevacizumab aren't currently recommended by NICE.\nSunitinib is the most commonly prescribed treatment for kidney cancer. It\u2019s a type of medication known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinase is an enzyme (protein) that helps cancer cells to grow. Sunitinib works by blocking protein kinase, stopping cancer from growing.\nSunitinib is taken as a capsule with or without food. You take it once a day for 4 weeks before having a 2-week break. This 6-week cycle is repeated for as long as the treatment is effective.\nIt\u2019s very important that you take sunitinib in the exact dosage that\u2019s been prescribed for you. Never stop taking medication for cancer without first consulting your specialist.\nCommon side effects of sunitinib include:\n\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nhair discolouration\nmouth soreness\nskin discolouration\nskin rashes or blisters\n\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about sunitinib and its side effects.\nLike sunitinib, pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells in the kidneys.\u00a0It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels, which they need to grow.\nPazopanib is taken as a tablet once a day with a glass of water. You should take it about the same time each day, either at least an hour before eating or 2 hours afterwards. It\u2019s important that you take it in the exact dosage that your specialist has prescribed for you.\nCommon side effects of pazopanib include:\n\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nhigh blood pressure\nhair discolouration\nabnormal liver function\u00a0\n\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about pazopanib and its side effects.\nAxitinib may be recommended for treating advanced kidney cancer if sunitinib and/or pazopanib have stopped working or haven\u2019t been effective.\nLike sunitinib and pazopanib, axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tyrosine kinase and stops cancer growing.\nAxitinib is taken as a tablet with a glass of water twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Your specialist may start you on a low dose which, depending on how you feel, may be increased after 2 weeks. It\u2019s very important that you take the exact dose that\u2019s been prescribed for you.\nCommon side effects of axitinib include:\n\ndiarrhoea\nnausea and vomiting\nloss of appetite\ntiredness\na decrease in thyroid hormone level (hypothyroidism)\nheadaches\nweight loss\nloss of fertility\n\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about axitinib and its\u00a0side effects.\nSorafenib is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the protein, tyrosine kinase, which encourages cancer cells to grow. It also prevents cancer cells from developing blood vessels which they need to grow.\nSorafenib is taken as a tablet twice a day (at the same time each day) with a glass of water. It can also be taken with a meal, but make sure the food is low-fat, because high-fat foods make it less effective.\nAgain, it\u2019s very important that you take sorafenib as instructed by your doctor at the exact dosage prescribed for you.\nCommon side effects of sorafenib include:\n\ndiarrhoea\nfatigue\nnausea and vomiting\nhair thinning (in around one in four people)\nincreased risk of bleeding \u2013 such as nosebleeds or bleeding gums\nloss of fertility\nflushed skin\n\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about sorafenib and its side effects.\nTemsirolimus is sometimes used to treat advanced kidney cancer. It\u2019s a type of medication known as an mTOR inhibitor, which blocks a protein called mTOR, that\u2019s usually active in cancer cells, making them reproduce and multiply. Temsirolimus also prevents blood vessels from developing, which cancer cells need to grow.\nTemsirolimus is a liquid that\u2019s delivered directly into the bloodstream, either through a tube that\u2019s put into a vein in your arm (catheter), or a tube into a large vein in your chest (a central line). The treatment takes 30\u00a0to 60 minutes and you have it once a week in hospital. Before each dose, an antihistamine is usually given to prevent an allergic reaction.\nCommon side effects of temsirolimus include:\n\nred, dry, itchy skin\nnausea and vomiting\nlack of appetite\ndiarrhoea\na sore mouth or mouth ulcers\nsleeping problems\nloss of fertility\n\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about temsirolimus and its side effects.\nEverolimus is a medication for advanced kidney cancer that\u2019s returned during or following treatment. It stops some of the signals produced within cells that make them grow and divide. Everolimus prevents the mTOR protein from working properly, which plays an important role in the growth of cancer cells.\nEverolimus is taken as a tablet once a day at the same time each day. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, rather than being chewed or crushed. It can be taken with or without food. It\u2019s very important that everolimus is taken using the exact dosage and method prescribed.\nCommon side effects of everolimus include:\n\na sore mouth\ntiredness\na rash or itchy, dry skin\nloss of appetite\nnausea and vomiting\na lack of\u00a0periods in women (this may be temporary)\nloss of fertility\n\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about everolimus and its side effects.\nImmunotherapy\nAs well as medications that prevent, disrupt and slow down the growth and development of kidney cancer (kinase and mTOR inhibitors), there are also treatments that work by encouraging the immune system to attack cancer cells. This type of treatment is known as immunotherapy.\nBevacizumab is a medication that\u2019s given intravenously (into a vein, through a drip). It blocks a protein called endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which helps cancer to grow. Bevacizumab is usually used in combination with\u00a0an immunotherapy treatment called interferon. Interferon is taken as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously), three times a week. It encourages your immune system to attack and destroy the cancer cells.\nAnother medication called aldesleukin is sometimes used to treat kidney cancer that\u2019s spread. It\u2019s similar to a natural protein the body produces called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is part of the immune system. IL-2 activates lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which fight illnesses and infections.\nAldesleukin works in a number of ways. It interferes with how cancer cells grow and multiply, it stimulates the immune system into attacking cancer cells, and it makes cancer cells send out chemicals that attract immune system cells. Like interferon, aldesleukin is usually given as a subcutaneous injection.\nImmunotherapy treatments are now rarely used to treat advanced kidney cancer. This is because targeted therapies tend to be more effective in controlling the condition, and immunotherapy can sometimes cause serious side effects.\nThe Cancer Research UK website has more information about treatments for advanced kidney cancer. You can also read more about new treatments that are currently being developed and tested in\u00a0clinical trials in their section about kidney cancer research.\n\n\nAs the causes of kidney cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to completely prevent it.\nHowever,\u00a0leading a healthy lifestyle may help reduce\u00a0your chances of developing the condition.\nRead about the causes of kidney cancer.\nCombining a\u00a0healthy diet and\u00a0regular exercise will help you avoid becoming overweight\u00a0or obese, which are both significant risk factors for kidney cancer.\nIf you're overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular physical activity\u00a0with a calorie-controlled diet.\nRead more about\u00a0healthy weight loss and treating obesity.\nDiet\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet that includes whole grains and plenty of fresh\u00a0fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) is recommended for a healthy heart.\nYou should also limit the amount of\u00a0salt in your diet to no more than 6g (0.2oz or 1 teaspoon) a day. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure.\nAvoid eating foods high in\u00a0saturated fat because it will increase your cholesterol level. High-fat foods include:\n\nmeat pies\nsausages and fatty cuts of meat\nbutter\nghee \u2013 a type of clarified butter often used in Indian cooking\nlard\ncream\nhard cheese\ncakes and biscuits\nfoods that contain coconut or palm oil\n\nThere's some evidence that eating a diet that has plenty of\u00a0oily fish (at least 1 portion a week) may help reduce the risk of kidney cancer. Examples of oily fish include:\n\nsalmon\nmackerel\nsardines\ntrout\nherring\n\nOily fish also contains vitamin D, which can reduce the risk of some cancers. You can also get\u00a0vitamin D from sunlight or by taking supplements.\nExercise\nIt's recommended that adults should do a minimum of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or\u00a0brisk walking, every week.\nThe exercise should be strenuous enough to increase your heart rate\u00a0and you should feel slightly out of breath afterwards.\nExamples of activities you could incorporate into your exercise programme include:\n\nbrisk walking\nhill climbing\nrunning\u00a0\ncycling\nswimming\u00a0\n\nIf you find it difficult to do 150 minutes of exercise a week, start at a level you feel comfortable with.\nHowever, you should visit your GP for a health check if you've never exercised before or you're returning to exercise after a long period of time.\nRead more about\u00a0exercise\u00a0and its benefits.\nGiving up\u00a0smoking\nIf you smoke, giving up is the most effective way of preventing kidney cancer, as well as a number of other serious health conditions, such as stroke,\u00a0heart attack and lung cancer.\nYour GP can help if you want to stop smoking, by giving you information and advice, and prescribing medication.\nOur stopping smoking pages have\u00a0useful information and advice about giving up smoking. Alternatively, you can call\u00a0Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0on 0800 84 84 84.\nRead more about\u00a0giving up smoking.\nAlcohol\nThere's evidence to suggest that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol, such as\u00a04\u00a0to 5 glasses of wine a month, will help reduce your risk of developing kidney cancer. The reasons for this aren't fully understood.\nHowever, you shouldn't exceed the recommended\u00a0limits for alcohol, because excessive drinking will place you at risk of developing liver disease, liver cancer, and high blood pressure (hypertension).\nRead more about\u00a0drinking and alcohol\u00a0and alcohol units.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "A kidney infection\u00a0(pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness\u00a0caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of\u00a0your kidneys.\nIt's more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful.\nIf treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn't cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn't treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage.\nSymptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.\nRead more about the symptoms of a kidney infection\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP\u00a0if you have a fever and persistent\u00a0tummy, lower back\u00a0or genital pain,\u00a0or if you notice a change\u00a0to your usual pattern of urination.\nMost kidney infections need\u00a0prompt treatment with\u00a0antibiotics to stop the infection from damaging the kidneys or spreading to the bloodstream. You may also need painkillers.\nIf you're especially vulnerable to the effects of an infection\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you\u00a0have a pre-existing health condition or are\u00a0pregnant, you may be admitted to hospital\u00a0and treated with antibiotics through an intravenous drip.\nAfter taking antibiotics, you should feel completely better after about two weeks.\nIn rare cases, a kidney infection can cause further problems. These include blood poisoning (sepsis) and a build-up of pus in the kidney called an abscess.\nRead more about\u00a0treating a kidney infection\u00a0and the complications of a kidney infection\nWhat causes a kidney infection?\nA kidney infection usually happens when bacteria\u00a0\u2013\u00a0often a type called\u00a0E. coli\u00a0\u2013\u00a0gets into the\u00a0urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body)\u00a0and travels up through the bladder\u00a0and\u00a0into the kidneys.\nRead more about the causes of a kidney infection\nWho's at risk?\nKidney infections are relatively rare. It's estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK.\nThey can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman's urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys.\nYounger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection.\nYounger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys.\nCan kidney infections be prevented?\nYou can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation.\nRead more about preventing a\u00a0kidney infection\n\n\nThe symptoms of a kidney infection usually develop quite quickly over a few hours or days.\nCommon symptoms\u00a0include:\n\npain and discomfort in your side, lower back\u00a0or around your genitals\nhigh temperature (it may reach 39.5C or 103.1F)\nshivering or chills\nfeeling very weak or tired\nloss of appetite\nfeeling sick or being sick\u00a0\ndiarrhoea\n\nYou may have other symptoms\u00a0if you also have cystitis or urethritis\u00a0(an infection of the urethra). These additional symptoms may include:\n\npain or a burning sensation during urination\nneed to urinate frequently or urgently\nfeeling that you're unable to urinate fully\nblood in your\u00a0urine\ncloudy or foul smelling urine\npain in your lower abdomen\n\nChildren\nChildren with a kidney infection may also have additional symptoms, such as:\n\na lack of energy\nirritability\npoor feeding and/or vomiting\nnot growing at the expected rate\nabdominal pain\njaundice\u00a0(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\nblood in the urine\nunpleasant smelling urine\nbedwetting\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nContact your GP if you have a high temperature, persistent pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Contact your GP immediately if you think your child may have a kidney infection.\nIf you have blood in your urine, you should always see your GP so the cause can be investigated.\nKidney infections require prompt treatment with\u00a0antibiotics to help relieve symptoms and prevent complications developing.\nYour GP can carry out some simple tests to help diagnose a kidney infection.\nSee\u00a0diagnosing kidney infections\u00a0for more information\n\n\nA kidney infection happens when bacteria infects your kidneys. The bacteria are usually a type called E. coli, which live in your bowel.\nThe bacteria\u00a0get in\u00a0through the opening of the urethra\u00a0and move upwards through your urinary tract, first infecting your bladder and then your kidneys.\nIt's thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by\u00a0accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. This can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. It can also happen during sex.\nIn rare cases, a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. However, this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems.\nWho's most likely to get a kidney infection?\nWomen and children are most at risk of developing a kidney infection, as well as other urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as cystitis.\nIn women, the urethra is closer to the anus than in men, making it easier for bacteria from the anus to\u00a0enter the urethra accidentally. The female urethra is also much shorter than the male urethra (which runs through the penis). This makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and move into the kidneys.\nOther\u00a0factors can also put you more at risk of developing a kidney infection, including:\n\nhaving a condition that blocks, or obstructs, your urinary tract, such as kidney stones\u00a0or an enlarged prostate\u00a0\u2013 children with constipation can also be at an increased risk\nbeing born with an abnormality in your urinary tract\nhaving a condition that prevents you emptying your bladder fully, such as an injury to your spinal cord\u00a0\u2013 this can allow bacteria in your bladder to multiply and spread\nhaving a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, due to type 2 diabetes or as a side effect of chemotherapy\nhaving an infection of the prostate gland called prostatitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the infection can spread from the prostate gland into the kidneys\u00a0\nhaving a\u00a0urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube inserted into your bladder to drain away urine)\nbeing female and sexually active\u00a0\u2013 sexual intercourse can irritate the urethra and allow bacteria to travel into your bladder\nbeing a man who has anal sex\u00a0\u2013 bacteria can travel up the urethra into the bladder\nbeing pregnant\u00a0\u2013 this can cause physical changes that slow the flow of urine out of your body and make it easier for bacteria to spread to the kidneys\nhaving undergone\u00a0female genital mutilation (FGM)\u00a0\u2013 an illegal practice where a\u00a0woman's genitals\u00a0are deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons\n\n\n\nTo work out if you have a kidney infection, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and your recent medical history.\nThey will usually also assess your general health by taking your temperature and measuring your blood pressure.\nUrine test\nA urine test can help to establish\u00a0whether you have a urinary tract infection (UTI). The test involves taking a small sample of urine and checking it to see if\u00a0there are\u00a0any bacteria in it.\nYou'll be given a container and told how to collect the urine, which you can do in the surgery or at home. If you do it at home, you'll need to label the container, seal it in a plastic bag and store it in the fridge. Ideally, hand it in to\u00a0the surgery within four hours.\nA\u00a0urine test can't\u00a0tell\u00a0whether the infection\u00a0\u2013 if\u00a0you have one\u00a0\u2013 is in your kidneys or another part of your urinary system, such as your bladder.\nFor your GP to be confident you have a kidney infection, you need to have a positive urine test plus\u00a0certain symptoms, such as a fever or a pain in your side.\nHospital scans\nYou may be referred to hospital for further testing if:\n\nyour symptoms fail to respond to treatment with antibiotics\nyour symptoms suddenly get worse\nyou have additional symptoms that aren't usually associated with a kidney infection\nyou're\u00a0at risk of\u00a0complications of a kidney infection\n\nChildren with recurrent UTIs\u00a0will also be referred to hospital for further testing.\nIn these circumstances,\u00a0scans can check your urinary tract for signs of problems. This may include:\n\na computer tomography (CT) scan \u2013 where\u00a0a scanner takes a series of X-rays and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed image of\u00a0your urinary tract\nan\u00a0ultrasound scan \u2013 which uses sound waves to build\u00a0an image of the inside of your body\nan isotope scan \u2013 where\u00a0a dye is injected into the bloodstream and a series of\u00a0X-rays are taken\n\nRead more about treating a kidney infection\n\n\nMost people with a kidney infection can be treated at home with a course of antibiotics, and possibly painkillers as well.\nSee your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination.\nAll children with symptoms of a\u00a0urinary tract infection (UTI)\u00a0or kidney infection, including cystitis, should see their GP or out-of-hours emergency service.\nMedication\nIf you're being treated at home, you'll usually be prescribed a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules that lasts between seven and 14 days.\nFor most people\u00a0\u2013\u00a0apart from pregnant women\u00a0\u2013 antibiotics called ciprofloxacin\u00a0or\u00a0Co-amoxiclav\u00a0are recommended. However, other antibiotics may also be used.\nCommon side effects of ciprofloxacin include feeling sick and diarrhoea.\nCo-amoxiclav\u00a0can make the\u00a0contraceptive pill and\u00a0contraceptive patches less effective, so you may need to use another form of contraception during the course of treatment.\nA 14-day course of an antibiotic called cefalexin is recommended for pregnant women.\nUsually, you'll start to feel better\u00a0quite soon after\u00a0treatment starts and you should feel completely better after about\u00a0two weeks.\nIf your symptoms show no sign of improvement\u00a024 hours after treatment starts, contact your GP for advice.\nTaking\u00a0a painkiller such as\u00a0paracetamol should help relieve symptoms of pain and a high temperature.\nHowever, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen aren't usually recommended to relieve pain during a kidney infection. This is because they\u00a0may increase the risk of further kidney problems.\nSelf-help tips\nIf you have\u00a0a kidney infection, try not to \"hover\" over the toilet seat when you go to the loo, because it can result in\u00a0your bladder not being fully emptied.\nIt's also\u00a0important to drink plenty of fluids, because this will help prevent dehydration and will help to flush out the bacteria from your kidneys. Aim to drink enough so that you're frequently passing pale-coloured urine.\nMake sure that you get plenty of rest. A kidney infection can be physically draining, even\u00a0if you're normally healthy and strong. It may take up to two weeks before you're fit enough to return to work.\nTreatment at hospital\nYour GP may refer you to hospital if you have an underlying problem with your urinary tract, which makes you vulnerable to kidney infections.\nIt's standard practice to further investigate all men with a kidney infection simply because the condition is much rarer in men. Only women who have had two or more kidney infections tend to be referred.\u00a0Most children with a kidney infection will be treated in hospital.\nHospital treatment may also be needed\u00a0if:\n\nyou're severely dehydrated\nyou're unable to swallow or keep down any fluids or medications\nyou have additional symptoms that suggest you may have\u00a0blood poisoning, such as a rapid heartbeat and losing consciousness\nyou're pregnant and you also have a high temperature\nyou're particularly frail and\u00a0your general health is poor\u00a0\nyour symptoms fail to improve within 24 hours of starting treatment with antibiotics\nyou have a weakened immune system\nyou have a foreign body inside your urinary tract, such as a kidney stone or a urinary catheter\nyou have diabetes\nyou're over the age of 65\nyou have an underlying condition that affects the\u00a0way your\u00a0kidneys work, such as\u00a0polycystic kidney disease or\u00a0chronic kidney disease\n\nIf you're admitted to hospital with a kidney infection, you'll probably be attached to a drip so\u00a0you can be given fluids to help keep you hydrated. Antibiotics can also be\u00a0given through the drip.\nYou'll have regular blood and urine tests to monitor your health and how effectively the antibiotics\u00a0are fighting off the infection.\nMost people respond well to treatment. As long as there are\u00a0no complications, they're usually well enough to leave hospital within three to seven days.\u00a0Treatment will usually switch to tablets or capsules after you stop receiving\u00a0antibiotics through a drip.\n\n\nMost kidney infections are treated successfully without complications, although some people may develop further problems.\nComplications of a kidney infection are rare, but you're more likely to\u00a0develop them if you:\n\nare a child\nare\u00a0over 65\nare pregnant\nhave\u00a0diabetes, chronic kidney disease\u00a0or sickle cell anaemia\nhave had a kidney transplant\u00a0(particularly in the first three months after the transplant)\nhave\u00a0a weakened immune system\ndeveloped the kidney infection while in hospital\n\nSome of the main complications of kidney infections are outlined below.\nKidney abscess\nA kidney\u00a0abscess is\u00a0a rare, but serious, complication of a kidney infection, where pus develops inside the tissue of the kidney.\nYou're\u00a0thought to be most at risk of developing a kidney abscess if you have diabetes.\nThe symptoms of a kidney abscess are similar to those of a kidney infection. The most common are:\n\na high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\nchills\nabdominal pain\nloss of appetite\npain when passing urine\n\nKidney abscesses are potentially serious because the bacteria inside the abscess can spread to other parts of\u00a0your body, such as\u00a0your bloodstream or lungs, and can be fatal.\nSmaller abscesses can usually be treated with antibiotics through a drip. Surgery is usually required for larger abscesses. This involves draining\u00a0the pus out of the abscess using a needle that's inserted into the kidney.\nBlood poisoning\nBlood poisoning (also called sepsis) is another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection.\u00a0It happens when bacteria spreads from the kidneys into the bloodstream. Once bacteria are\u00a0in your blood, the infection can spread to any part of your body, including all of the major organs.\nIn\u00a0someone with a kidney infection, the\u00a0symptoms of blood poisoning include:\n\nlow blood pressure, which makes you feel dizzy when you stand up\nconfusion or disorientation\nexcessive sweating\nuncontrollable shaking or shivering\nhigh temperature or lower body temperature than usual (under 36C, or 96.8F)\npale skin\nrapid heartbeat\nbreathlessness\n\nBlood poisoning\u00a0is a medical emergency that usually requires admission to a hospital\u00a0intensive care unit (ICU) while antibiotics are used to fight the infection.\nIf you're taking certain medications for diabetes, such as metformin or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, they may be temporarily withdrawn until you recover. This is because they can cause kidney damage during an episode of blood poisoning.\nSevere infection\nAnother rare, but potentially fatal, complication of a kidney infection is a condition called emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN).\nEPN is a severe infection, where the tissues of the kidneys are rapidly destroyed and the bacteria causing\u00a0the infection begin to release a toxic gas, which builds up inside the kidneys.\nThe exact cause of EPN is unclear, but almost all cases\u00a0are in people with diabetes.\nThe usual treatment is emergency surgery to remove some, or all, of the affected kidney. It's possible to live\u00a0a full and active life\u00a0with only one kidney.\nKidney failure\nIn very rare cases, a kidney infection can cause severe kidney damage that results in kidney failure. This is when the kidneys stop working properly.\nKidney failure is potentially fatal, but it can be treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant.\nOther problems\nA kidney infection can also cause other complications, including\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension)\u00a0or premature labour or birth.\n\n\nThe best way to prevent a kidney infection is to keep your bladder and urethra free from bacteria.\nThese self-help tips explain how\u00a0you can do this.\nDrink plenty of liquids\nDrinking plenty of liquids, particularly water, will help to wash bacteria from your bladder and urinary tract.\nDrinking cranberry juice or taking cranberry extracts may also help prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs).\u00a0However, you should\u00a0avoid cranberry juice or extracts if you're taking warfarin, a medicine used to prevent blood clots.\u00a0Cranberry juice can make the effects of warfarin more potent, so there's a risk of excessive bleeding.\nToilet tips\nTo help keep your\u00a0urinary tract\u00a0free from bacteria:\n\ngo to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in\nwipe from front to back after going to the toilet\npractice good hygiene by washing your genitals every day and before having sex\nempty your bladder after having sex\nif you're a woman,\u00a0avoid \"hovering\" over a toilet seat as this position can often leave urine behind in the bladder\n\nTreat constipation\nConstipation can increase your chances of developing a urinary tract infection\u00a0(UTI), so\u00a0try to\u00a0treat\u00a0any constipation\u00a0promptly.\nRecommended treatments for constipation\u00a0include:\n\nincreasing the amount of fibre in your diet to 20-30g of fibre a day\nusing a mild\u00a0laxative on a short-term basis\ndrinking plenty of fluids\n\nSee\u00a0your GP if your symptoms don't improve after 14 days (or seven days for children with constipation).\nRead more\u00a0about treating\u00a0constipation\nBe careful with contraceptives\nIf you\u00a0keep getting\u00a0UTIs (more than three\u00a0a year\u00a0is considered high), avoid using spermicide-coated condoms or diaphragms. This is because spermicide can stimulate the production of bacteria.\u00a0\nStick to\u00a0lubricated condoms without spermicide,\u00a0because unlubricated ones can irritate the urethra and make it more vulnerable to infection.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60.\nThey're\u00a0quite common, with around three in 20 men and up to two in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives.\nThe medical\u00a0term for kidney stones is nephrolithiasis, and if\u00a0they cause severe pain it's known as renal colic.\nSymptoms of kidney stones\nSmall kidney stones may\u00a0go undetected and be passed out painlessly in the urine.\u00a0But it's fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the:\n\nureter \u2013 the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder\nurethra \u2013 the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body\n\nA blockage can cause severe pain in the abdomen or groin and sometimes causes a urinary tract infection\u00a0(UTI).\nRead more about the symptoms of kidney stones.\nWhat causes kidney stones?\nThe waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump.\nThis is more likely to happen if you don't drink enough fluids, if you're taking\u00a0some types of\u00a0medication,\u00a0or if you have\u00a0a medical condition\u00a0that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine.\nRead more about the causes of kidney stones.\nAfter a kidney stone has formed,\u00a0your body\u00a0will try to pass it\u00a0out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means\u00a0it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder).\nTreating and preventing kidney stones\nMost kidney stones\u00a0are small enough to be passed in your urine, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication.\nLarger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or\u00a0laser energy. Occasionally, keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly.\nRead more about treating kidney stones.\nIt's estimated that\u00a0up to\u00a0half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following five\u00a0years.\nTo avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day\u00a0so you don't become dehydrated. It's very important to keep your urine diluted (clear) to prevent waste products forming into kidney stones.\nRead more about preventing kidney stones.\n\n\nVery small kidney stones are unlikely to cause many symptoms. It may even go undetected and pass out painlessly when you urinate.\nSymptoms usually occur if the kidney stone:\n\ngets stuck in your kidney\nstarts to travel down the ureter (the tube that attaches each kidney to the bladder)\u00a0\u2013 the ureter is narrow and kidney stones can\u00a0cause pain as they try to pass through\ncauses an infection\n\nIn these cases, the symptoms of kidney stones can include:\n\na persistent ache in the lower back,\u00a0which is sometimes also felt in the groin\u00a0\u2013 men may have pain in their\u00a0testicles and scrotum\nperiods of intense pain in the back or side of your abdomen, or occasionally in your groin, which\u00a0may last for minutes or hours\nfeeling restless and unable to lie still\nnausea (feeling sick)\nneeding to urinate more often than normal\npain when you urinate (dysuria)\nblood in your urine (haematuria) \u2013 this\u00a0may be caused by the stone scratching the kidney or ureter\n\nBlocked ureter and kidney infection\nA kidney stone that blocks the ureter can lead to a kidney infection. This is because waste products are unable to pass the blockage, which may cause a build-up of bacteria.\nThe\u00a0symptoms of a kidney infection\u00a0are similar to symptoms of\u00a0kidney stones, but may also include:\n\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over\nchills and shivering\nfeeling very weak or tired\ndiarrhoea\ncloudy and bad-smelling urine\n\nRead more about kidney infections.\n\n\nKidney stones are usually formed following a build-up of certain chemicals in the body.\nThis build-up\u00a0may be any of the following:\n\ncalcium\nammonia\nuric acid\u00a0\u2013 a waste product produced when the body breaks down food to use as energy\ncysteine\u00a0\u2013 an amino acid that helps to build protein\n\nCertain medical conditions can lead to an unusually high level of these substances in your urine.\nYou're also\u00a0more likely to develop kidney stones if you don't drink enough fluids.\nRecurrent kidney stones\u00a0\nSome people are particularly likely to keep\u00a0on developing kidney stones, including people who:\n\neat a high-protein, low-fibre diet\nare\u00a0inactive or bed-bound\nhave a family history of kidney stones\nhave had several kidney or urinary infections\nhave had a kidney stone before, particularly if it was before you were 25\nhave only one fully working kidney\nhave had an intestinal bypass (surgery on your digestive system), or a condition affecting the small intestine, such as\u00a0Crohn's disease\n\nThere's evidence to suggest that certain medications may increase your risk of developing recurrent kidney stones. These include:\n\naspirin\u00a0\nantacids\u00a0\ndiuretics (used to reduce fluid build-up)\ncertain antibiotics\ncertain antiretroviral medication\u00a0(used to treat HIV)\ncertain anti-epileptic medication\n\nTypes of kidney stones\nKidney stones can develop for a number of reasons. The causes of the four main types of kidney stone are outlined below.\nCalcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and form if there's too much calcium in the urine, which can be due to:\n\nan inherited\u00a0condition called hypercalcuria, which leads to\u00a0large amounts of calcium in urine\nan overactive parathyroid gland (the parathyroid glands help to regulate the amount of calcium in your body)\nkidney disease\na rare condition called sarcoidosis\u00a0\nsome cancers\n\nCalcium stones are usually either large and smooth or spiky and rough.\nStruvite stones are often caused by infections, and they most commonly occur after a\u00a0urinary tract infection\u00a0that's lasted a long time.\nStruvite stones are more common in women than men.\nUric acid stones can form if there's a large amount of acid in your urine. They may be caused by:\n\neating a high-protein diet that includes lots of meat\na condition\u00a0such as gout\u00a0that prevents the body breaking down certain chemicals\u00a0\nan inherited condition that causes higher than normal levels of acid in the body\nchemotherapy\n\nCystine stones are the rarest type of kidney stone. They're caused by an inherited condition called cystinuria, which affects the amount of acid that is passed in your urine.\n\n\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose kidney stones from your symptoms and medical history.\nIt will be particularly easy if you've had kidney stones before.\nYou may be given tests, including:\n\nurine tests to check for infections and pieces of stones\nan examination of any stones that you pass in your urine\nblood tests to check that your kidneys are working properly, and to also check the levels of substances that could cause kidney stones, such as calcium\n\nYou can collect\u00a0a kidney stone by urinating through some gauze or a stocking.\nHaving a kidney stone to analyse will make a diagnosis easier, and may help your GP determine which treatment method will be of most benefit to you.\nIf you have severe pain that isn't controlled by painkillers, or if you have a high temperature as well as pain, you may be referred to a urologist (a specialist in treating urinary problems).\nImaging tests\nIf you're\u00a0referred to hospital for an imaging test,\u00a0a number of different techniques may be used. Imaging tests can help confirm the diagnosis, or identify precisely where a kidney stone is.\nThese tests\u00a0include:\n\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 where a series of X-rays at slightly different angles are taken and a computer is used to put the images together\nX-ray\u00a0\u2013 an imaging technique that uses high-energy\u00a0radiation to highlight abnormalities in body tissue\nan ultrasound scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body\nan intravenous urogram (IVU) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) \u2013 a dye that shows up on X-ray is injected into a vein in your arm; the X-ray image highlights any blockages as the kidneys filter the dye out of your blood and into your\u00a0urine\n\nCT scans are now often used because they're thought to be more accurate (IVUs were previously the preferred imaging method). The imaging technique you have may depend on what's available\u00a0at your local hospital.\n\n\nMost kidney stones are small enough (less than 4mm in diameter) to be passed out in your urine and can probably be treated at home.\nBut even small kidney stones can be painful, although this\u00a0usually only lasts a couple of days and disappears when the stone has been passed.\nMedication\nIf you are in severe pain, your GP can give you pain relief by injection. A second dose can be given after half an hour if you're still experiencing pain.\nMedication can also be injected to treat the symptoms of nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. This is called an anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medication.\nYou may also be given a prescription for painkillers, anti-emetics, or both, to take at home.\nSelf care\nYou may be advised to wait until you pass your kidney stone when you go to the toilet, and to try to collect it from your urine. You can do this by filtering your urine through gauze or a stocking.\nGive the stone to your GP so that they can have it analysed to help determine any further treatment you may need.\nYou should drink enough water to make your urine colourless. If your urine is yellow or brown, you're not drinking enough.\nAdmission to hospital\nIf your kidney stone has moved into your ureter (the tube that carries waste products from the kidneys to the bladder), and it's causing severe pain, your GP may admit you to hospital for treatment.\nThis may be necessary if:\n\nyou're at an increased risk of your kidneys failing\u00a0(for example, because you only have one kidney)\nyour symptoms don't improve within an hour of being given painkillers or anti-sickness medication\nyou're\u00a0dehydrated and vomiting too much to keep fluids down\nyou're pregnant\nyou're over 60 years of age\n\nTreating large kidney stones\nIf a kidney stone is too big to be passed naturally\u00a0\u2013 6-7mm\u00a0(about 0.23 to 0.27in)\u00a0in diameter or larger \u2013 you may need treatment to remove it another way.\nThis could include:\n\nextracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)\nureteroscopy\npercutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)\nopen surgery\n\nThese procedures are explained in more detail below. The type of treatment you have will depend on the size and location of your stones.\u00a0\nESWL is the most common way of treating kidney stones that can't be passed in the urine.\nIt involves using\u00a0ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to pinpoint where a kidney stone is. Ultrasound shock waves are then sent to the stone from a machine to break it into smaller pieces, so it can be passed in your urine.\nESWL can be an uncomfortable form of treatment, so it's usually carried out after giving painkilling medication.\nYou may need more than one session of ESWL to successfully treat your kidney stones. ESWL is up to 99% effective for stones up to 20mm (0.8in) in diameter.\u00a0\nIf a kidney stone is stuck in the ureter, you may need to have a ureteroscopy, which is also sometimes known as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).\nIt\u00a0involves passing a long, thin telescope called a ureteroscope through your urethra (the tube\u00a0urine passes through on its way out of the body) and\u00a0into your bladder. It's then passed up into your ureter to where the stone is stuck.\nThe surgeon may either try to\u00a0gently remove the stone using another instrument, or they may use laser energy to break it up into small pieces so that it can be passed naturally in your urine.\nUreteroscopy is carried out under general anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're unconscious), so you shouldn't drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure.\nFor stones up to 15mm (0.6in), a ureteroscopy is effective in 50-80% of cases.\nA\u00a0plastic tube called a stent may need to be\u00a0temporarily inserted inside you to allow the stone fragments to drain into the bladder.\nPCNL is an alternative procedure that may be used for larger stones. It may also be used\u00a0if ESWL isn't suitable\u00a0\u2013 for example, because the person being treated is obese.\u00a0\nPCNL involves using a thin telescopic instrument called a nephroscope. A small incision is made in your back and the nephroscope is passed through it and into your kidney. The stone is either pulled out or broken into smaller pieces using a laser or pneumatic energy.\nPCNL is always carried out under general anaesthetic,\u00a0so you shouldn't drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure.\nPCNL is 86% effective for stones that are 21-30mm (0.8-1.2in) in diameter.\u00a0\u00a0\nNowadays, open surgery for kidney stones is rare (less than 1% of cases require this type of surgery). It's only usually used if there's a very large stone or abnormal anatomy.\u00a0\nDuring open surgery, an incision will be made in your back so that your surgeon is able to access your ureter and kidney. The kidney stone can then be removed.\u00a0\nTreating uric acid stones\nIf you have a uric acid stone, you may be advised to drink around three litres (just over five pints) of water each day to try to dissolve it.\nUric acid stones are much softer than other types of kidney stone, and they can be made smaller if they're exposed to alkaline fluids.\nYou\u00a0may need to take some medication to make your urine more alkaline before the uric acid stone starts to dissolve.\nComplications of treatment\nComplications can occur following the treatment of large kidney stones. Your surgeon should explain these to you before you have the procedure.\nPossible complications will depend on the type of treatment you have and the size and position of your stones.\u00a0Complications could include:\n\nsepsis\u00a0\u2013 an infection that spreads through the blood, causing symptoms throughout the whole body\na blocked ureter\u00a0\u2013 caused by stone\u00a0fragments; the ureter is the tube that attaches the kidney to the bladder\nan injury to the ureter\na urinary tract infection\nbleeding during surgery\npain\n\nIt's estimated that 5-9% of people may experience complications after having a ureteroscopy.\n\n\nThe best way of preventing kidney stones is to make sure you drink plenty of water each day to avoid becoming dehydrated.\nKeeping your urine diluted helps to stop waste products getting too concentrated and forming stones.\nYou can tell how diluted your urine is by looking at its colour. The darker your urine is, the more concentrated it is.\nYour urine is usually a dark yellow colour in the morning because it contains a build-up of waste products that your body has produced overnight.\nDrinks such as tea, coffee and fruit juice can count towards your fluid intake, but water is the healthiest option and is best for preventing kidney stones developing.\nYou should also make sure you drink more when it's hot or when you're exercising, to replenish fluids lost through sweating.\nRead more about preventing dehydration.\nDiet\nIf your kidney stone is caused by too much calcium, you may be advised to reduce the amount of oxalates in your diet.\nOxalates prevent calcium being absorbed by your body, and can accumulate in your kidney to form a stone.\nFoods that contain oxalates include:\n\nbeetroot\nasparagus\nrhubarb\nchocolate\nberries\nleeks\nparsley\ncelery\nalmonds, peanuts and cashew nuts\nsoy products\ngrains, such as oatmeal, wheat germ and wholewheat\n\nDon't reduce the amount of calcium in your diet unless your GP advises you to. This is because calcium is very important for maintaining healthy bones and teeth.\u00a0\nTo avoid developing a uric acid stone, you should reduce the amount of meat, poultry and fish in your diet. You may also be prescribed medication to change the levels of acid or alkaline in your urine.\nMedication\nIf you have a kidney stone, medication will usually be prescribed for pain relief or to prevent infections developing.\nHowever, some medication may need to be reviewed by your GP if it's thought to be causing your kidney stone.\nThe type of medication your GP prescribes will depend on the type of kidney stone you have.\nFor example, if you have:\n\ncalcium stones \u2013\u00a0you may be prescribed a\u00a0diuretic medication if they are caused by hypercalcuria (an inherited condition)\u00a0\nstruvite stones \u2013\u00a0you may be prescribed antibiotics to help prevent a urinary tract infection or kidney infection, which are the main causes of struvite stones\nuric acid stones \u2013 you may be prescribed allopurinol (a medication used to lower uric acid levels) and medication to help alkalise your urine\ncystine stones \u2013 you may be prescribed medication to lower levels of cystine in\u00a0your urine\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection. It causes a delicate structure deep inside your ear called the labyrinth to become inflamed, affecting your hearing and balance.\nThe most common symptoms are dizziness, hearing loss (from mild to total loss of hearing) and vertigo \u2013 the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving.\nThese symptoms can range from mild to severe, with some people feeling that they are unable to remain upright.

You should also avoid driving, using tools and machinery, or working at heights if you're feeling dizzy.\nTreating labyrinthitis\nIn most cases, the symptoms pass within a few weeks. Treatment involves a combination of bed rest and medication to help you cope better with the symptoms. You may need additional medication to fight the underlying infection, although antibiotics are not often required as the cause is most commonly due to a virus.\nContact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.\nA small number of people have persistent symptoms that last for several months, or possibly years. This requires a more intensive type of treatment called vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).\nRead more about treating labyrinthitis\nThe labyrinth\nThe labyrinth is the innermost part of the ear. It contains two important parts:\n\nthe cochlea \u2013 this relays sounds to the brain and is responsible for hearing\nthe vestibular system \u2013 a complex set of fluid-filled channels that contributes to your sense of balance\n\nInflammation of the labyrinth can disrupt your hearing and sense of balance, triggering the symptoms of labyrinthitis. The labyrinth usually becomes inflamed either because of:\n\na viral infection, such as a cold or flu\na bacterial infection, which is much less common\n\nRead more about the causes of labyrinthitis\nWho gets labyrinthitis?\nMost cases of viral labyrinthitis occur in adults aged 30 to 60 years old. Viral labyrinthitis is relatively common in adults. Other types of ear infections are usually more widespread in children. Bacterial labyrinthitis is much less common. Younger children under two years old are more vulnerable to developing bacterial labyrinthitis.\nComplications of labyrinthitis\nBacterial labyrinthitis carries a higher risk of causing permanent hearing loss, particularly in children who have developed it as a complication of meningitis.\nBecause of this high risk, a hearing test is recommended following bacterial labyrinthitis.\nSevere hearing loss following bacterial labyrinthitis can sometimes be treated with a cochlear implant. This is not a conventional hearing aid, but a small electronic device fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery.\nRead more information about hearing loss\nVestibular neuronitis\nMany people diagnosed with labyrinthitis only experience the balance symptoms without hearing loss.\nThis is actually known as\u00a0vestibular neuronitis rather than labyrinthitis.\nHowever, both terms are often used to describe the same diagnosis.\n\n\nLabyrinthitis is caused by inflammation of part of the inner ear known as the labyrinth. This is caused by an infection.\nHow the labyrinth works\nThe fluid-filled channels of the labyrinth are known as the vestibular system and they are connected at different angles. This fluid moves when you move your head, telling your brain how far, fast and in what direction your head is moving. This allows your body to balance properly. The vestibular system works in a similar way to a stereo, with your left and right ears sending separate signals to your brain. If one ear becomes infected, these signals become out of sync, which confuses your brain and triggers symptoms such as dizziness and loss of balance.\nThe labyrinth also contains a small, spiral-shaped cavity called the cochlea. It sends sound waves to the language processing areas of the brain. Inflammation can disrupt this function, leading to hearing loss.\nViral labyrinthitis\nAround half of all cases of viral labyrinthitis are thought to be caused when a viral infection of the chest, nose, mouth and airways \u2013\u00a0such as the\u00a0common cold or flu \u2013\u00a0spreads to the inner ear.\nInfections that affect the rest of the\u00a0body, such as measles,\u00a0mumps or glandular fever, are a less common cause of viral labyrinthitis.\nBacterial labyrinthitis\nLabyrinthitis can sometimes be caused by a bacterial infection. This is rarer than a viral infection and is likely to be more serious.\nBacteria can enter the labyrinth if the thin layers of tissue that separate your middle ear from your inner ear are broken. This can happen if you have a\u00a0middle ear infection or an infection of the brain lining (meningitis). Bacteria can also get into your inner ear if you have had a head injury.\nImmune system problems\nLabyrinthitis often develops in people who have an underlying autoimmune condition (where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue rather than fighting off infections).\n\n\nMany conditions can cause dizziness and vertigo. Your GP will usually diagnose labyrinthitis based on your symptoms, your medical history and a physical examination.\nYour GP may carry out the following tests:\n\na physical examination \u2013 you may be asked to move your head or body and your ears will be checked for signs of inflammation and infection\nhearing tests\u00a0\u2013 labyrinthitis is more likely if\u00a0you have\u00a0hearing loss\n\nYour GP will also check your eyes. If they are flickering uncontrollably, it is usually a sign that your vestibular system (the body's balancing system) is not working properly.\nViral or bacterial labyrinthitis?\nThere is no reliable test to determine whether labyrinthitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection\u00a0because testing for infection would damage the labyrinth.\nDoctors can usually safely assume that labyrinthitis is the result of a viral infection (more common) unless there is strong evidence to suggest otherwise, such as:\n\nthe labyrinthitis is in a very young child\nlabyrinthitis occurs in someone who is already known to have a bacterial infection\nyou have common bacterial labyrinthitis symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and complete hearing loss\n\nFurther testing\nFurther testing is usually only required if you have additional symptoms that suggest\u00a0you may\u00a0have a more serious condition, such as meningitis or a stroke.\u00a0Symptoms can\u00a0include:\n\nsevere headache\nmental confusion\nslurred speech\nweakness or paralysis on one side of your body\n\nThese\u00a0tests can include:\n\na\u00a0lumbar puncture\u00a0\u2013 a fluid sample is taken from the base of your spine and checked for infection\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to give a three-dimensional picture of your brain\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to give a detailed image of your brain\nblood tests\n\n\n\nLabyrinthitis is usually treated using a combination of self-help techniques and medication. Chronic labyrinthitis may be treated with vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).\nSelf-help\nDrink plenty of liquid, little and often, particularly water, to avoid becoming dehydrated.\nIn its early stages, you may feel constantly dizzy and it can give you severe vertigo. You should rest in bed to avoid falling and injuring yourself. After a few days, the worst of these symptoms should have passed and you should no longer feel dizzy all the time.\nYou can do several things\u00a0to minimise any remaining feelings of\u00a0dizziness and vertigo. For example:\n\nduring an attack, lie still in a comfortable position (on your side is often best)\navoid alcohol\navoid bright lights\ntry to cut out noise and anything that causes stress from your surroundings\n\nYou should also avoid driving, using tools and machinery or working at heights if you're feeling dizzy and unbalanced.\nMedication\nIf your dizziness, vertigo and loss of balance are particularly severe, your GP may prescribe a short course of medication such as benzodiazepine or antiemetics (vestibular sedatives).\nBenzodiazepines reduce activity inside your central nervous system. This means your brain is less likely to be affected by the abnormal signals coming from your vestibular system.\nHowever, long-term use of benzodiazepines is not recommended because they can be highly addictive if used for long periods.\nA prescription medication known as an antiemetic may be prescribed if you're experiencing nausea and vomiting.\nProchlorperazine 5mg tablets are an antiemetic used to treat the symptoms of vertigo and dizziness. It may be considered as an alternative treatment to benzodiazepines.\nMost people are able to tolerate prochlorperazine and side effects are uncommon, but can include:\n\ntremors (shaking)\nabnormal or involuntary body and facial movements\nsleepiness\n\nIf you are vomiting, there is a prochlorperazine 3mg tablet available which you place inside your mouth between your gums and cheek.\nCorticosteroids such as prednisolone may be recommended if your symptoms are particularly severe. They are often effective at reducing inflammation.\nIf your labyrinthitis is thought to be caused by a bacterial infection, you will be prescribed antibiotics. Depending on how serious the infection is, this could either be antibiotic tablets or capsules (oral antibiotics) or antibiotic injections (intravenous antibiotics).\nCheck the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicines for a full list of possible side effects.\nContact your GP if you develop additional symptoms that suggest your condition may be getting worse. If this happens, you may be admitted to hospital. These symptoms include:\n\nmental confusion\nslurred speech\ndouble vision\u00a0\nweakness or numbness in one part of your body\na change in the way you usually walk\n\nAlso contact your GP if you do not notice any improvement after three weeks. You may need to be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.\nChronic labyrinthitis\nA small number of people experience dizziness and vertigo for months or even years. This is sometimes known as chronic labyrinthitis.\nThe symptoms are not usually as severe as when you first get the condition, although even mild\u00a0dizziness can have a considerable impact on your quality of life, employment and other daily activities.\nVestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is an effective treatment for people with chronic labyrinthitis. VRT attempts to \"retrain\" your brain and nervous system to compensate for the abnormal signals coming from your vestibular system.\nVRT is usually carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist and involves a range of exercises designed to:\n\nco-ordinate your hand and eye movements\nstimulate sensations of dizziness so your brain starts to get used to disruptive signals sent by your vestibular system and then ignores them\nimprove your balance and walking ability\nimprove your strength and fitness\n\nThe Brain and Spine Foundation is a UK charity that has more information about\u00a0vestibular rehabilitation on its website.\nYou can ask your GP to refer you to a physiotherapist or you can pay for private treatment. If you decide to see a private physiotherapist, make sure they are fully qualified and a member of a recognised body, such as the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP).\nNot all physiotherapists have training in VRT, so you need to make it clear you require this type of treatment before making an appointment.\n\n\nPermanent hearing loss can be a common complication of labyrinthitis, particularly in children who have developed bacterial labyrinthitis as a complication of the brain infection meningitis.\nIt's estimated that as many as\u00a0one in\u00a0five children will develop hearing loss after having\u00a0meningitis. The hearing loss can either be partial or complete.\nBecause\u00a0of\u00a0the high risk of hearing loss occurring after bacterial labyrinthitis, it is recommended that a person is given a hearing test once they have recovered from the infection.\nPermanent, severe hearing loss following\u00a0bacterial labyrinthitis can sometimes be treated with a\u00a0cochlear implant. This is not a conventional hearing aid, but a small electronic\u00a0device fitted under the skin behind the ear during surgery.\nRead more information about\u00a0hearing loss.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products.\nSymptoms of lactose intolerance\u00a0usually develop within a few hours of consuming food\u00a0or drink that contains lactose. They may include:\n\nflatulence (wind)\ndiarrhoea\nbloated stomach\nstomach cramps and pains\nstomach rumbling\nfeeling sick\n\nThe severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you've consumed.\nSome people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nThe symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it's important to see your GP for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet.\nFor example, the symptoms above can also be caused by:\n\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\u00a0\u2013 a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system\nmilk protein intolerance \u2013 an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk allergy)\n\nIf your GP thinks\u00a0you\u00a0have lactose intolerance,\u00a0they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve.\nRead more about diagnosing lactose intolerance\nWhat causes lactose intolerance?\nThe body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream.\nPeople with\u00a0lactose intolerance\u00a0don't produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it's fermented by bacteria. This leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.\nDepending on the underlying reason why the body isn't producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks.\nRead more about the causes of lactose intolerance\nWho's affected?\nIn the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent.\nLactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected.\nIs it an allergy?\nLactose\u00a0intolerance isn't the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This\u00a0causes symptoms such as\u00a0a rash, wheezing and itching.\nIf you're allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person).\nTreating lactose intolerance\nThere's no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to\u00a0control the symptoms.\nDepending on what dairy products you're able to eat, you may also require additional\u00a0calcium\u00a0and\u00a0vitamin D\u00a0supplements to keep\u00a0your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice.\nIn addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes\u00a0may\u00a0also be helpful. These are\u00a0drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion\u00a0of lactose.\nRead more about treating lactose intolerance\nComplications of lactose intolerance\nMilk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and\u00a0vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These\u00a0vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones.\nIf you're lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and\u00a0put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions:\n\nOsteopenia \u2013\u00a0where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis \u2013 where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased.\nMalnutrition \u2013 when the food you eat doesn't give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you're malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed.\n\nIf you're concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements.\nYour GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The British Dietetic Association has information on how to find a private dietitian.\n\n\nLactose intolerance is usually the result of your body not producing enough lactase.\nLactase is an enzyme (a protein that causes a chemical reaction to occur) normally produced in your small intestine that's used to digest lactose.\nIf you have a lactase deficiency, it means your body doesn't produce enough lactase.\nDigesting lactose\nAfter eating or drinking something containing lactose, it passes down your oesophagus (gullet) into your stomach, where it's digested. The digested food then passes into your small intestine.\nThe lactase in your small intestine should break lactose down into glucose and galactose (other types of sugar), which are then absorbed into your bloodstream. If there isn't enough lactase, the unabsorbed lactose moves through your digestive system to your colon (large intestine).\nBacteria in the colon ferment (break down) the lactose, producing fatty acids and gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The breakdown of the lactose in the colon, and the resulting acids and gases that are produced, cause the symptoms of lactose intolerance such as flatulence and bloating.\nTypes of lactase deficiency\nThe main types of lactase deficiency are outlined below.\nPrimary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance worldwide. This type of lactase deficiency is caused by an inherited genetic fault that runs in families.\nPrimary lactase deficiency develops when your lactase production decreases as your diet becomes less reliant on milk and dairy products. This is usually after the age of two, when breastfeeding or bottle-feeding has stopped, although the symptoms may not be noticeable until adulthood.\nSecondary lactase deficiency is a shortage of lactase caused by a problem in your small intestine. It can occur at any age, and may be the result of another condition, surgery to your small intestine, or taking certain medication.\nSecondary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance in the UK, particularly in babies and young children.\nPossible causes of secondary lactase deficiency include:\n\ngastroenteritis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the stomach and intestines\ncoeliac disease\u00a0\u2013 a bowel condition caused by an adverse reaction to a protein called gluten\nCrohn's disease\u00a0\u2013 a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system\nulcerative colitis\u00a0\u2013 a long-term condition that affects the large intestine\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 a cancer treatment\nlong courses of antibiotics\n\nThe decrease in the production of lactase in secondary lactase deficiency is sometimes only temporary, but it may be permanent if it's caused by a long-term condition.\nIt's also possible to develop secondary lactase deficiency later in life, even without another condition to trigger it. This is because your body's production of lactase naturally reduces as you get older.\nCongenital lactase deficiency is a rare condition that runs in families and is found in newborn babies.\nIt's caused by an inherited\u00a0genetic fault that means affected babies produce very little or no lactase.\nThe genetic mutation responsible for\u00a0congenital lactase deficiency is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means\u00a0both parents must have a copy of the faulty gene to pass on\u00a0the condition.\nSome babies born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a temporary lactose intolerance because their small intestine wasn't fully developed\u00a0by the time they were born.\nThis is known as developmental lactase deficiency and it usually improves as\u00a0affected babies get older.\n\n\nIt's important to visit your GP if you think you or your child may have lactose intolerance, as the symptoms can be similar to other conditions.\nBefore seeing your GP, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what symptoms you experience. Tell your GP if you notice any patterns, or if there are any foods you seem particularly sensitive to.\nYour GP may suggest trying to\u00a0remove lactose from your diet for two weeks to see if it helps to relieve your symptoms. This will provide further evidence\u00a0of whether\u00a0you're lactose intolerant.\nFurther testing\nOther tests aren't usually needed, but your GP may sometimes suggest further tests to:\n\nhelp confirm the diagnosis\nfind out how much lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose) your body is producing\ntry to determine what might be causing your lactose intolerance\n\nSome of the main tests that may be\u00a0used\u00a0are described below.\nA hydrogen breath test is a simple way of determining if you may be lactose intolerant.\nYou'll be asked to avoid eating or drinking during the night before the test. When you arrive for the test, you'll be asked to blow up a balloon-like bag.\u00a0This sample of your breath will be tested to find out how much hydrogen is present, measured in parts per million (ppm).\nYou'll then be given a drink of lactose solution\u00a0and your breath will be tested every 15 minutes over the next few hours to see if the level of hydrogen changes.\nIf your breath contains a large amount of hydrogen (more than 20ppm above your baseline) after consuming the lactose solution, it's likely that you're lactose intolerant. This is\u00a0because\u00a0lactose intolerance can cause the bacteria in the colon (large intestine) to produce more hydrogen than normal.\nIn a lactose tolerance test, you'll be given a drink of lactose solution and a blood sample will be taken from your arm using a needle. The blood will be tested to see how much glucose (blood sugar) it contains.\nIf you're lactose intolerant, your blood sugar levels will either rise slowly, or not at all. This is because your body is unable to break down the lactose into glucose.\nIn a milk tolerance test, you'll be given a glass of milk (about 500ml) and your blood sugar levels will be tested. If your blood sugar levels don't rise after drinking the milk, you may be lactose intolerant.\nA\u00a0small bowel biopsy is rarely used to diagnose lactose intolerance. However, it may be carried out to see if your symptoms are being caused by another condition, such as\u00a0coeliac disease.\nIn a small bowel biopsy, a sample of your small intestinal lining is taken using an\u00a0endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light and a tiny cutting tool at the end) that's passed down your throat. This will be carried out under\u00a0local anaesthetic, so it won't hurt.\nThe sample of intestinal lining will be tested to see how much lactase it contains. If it only contains a small amount of lactase,\u00a0it's likely you're lactose intolerant. The sample can also be examined to look for signs of possible underlying conditions such as coeliac disease.\n\n\nThere's no cure for lactose intolerance, but most people are able to control their symptoms by making changes to their diet.\nSome cases of lactose intolerance, such as those caused by gastroenteritis, are only temporary and will improve within a few days or weeks. Other cases, such as\u00a0those caused by an inherited genetic fault or a long-term underlying condition, are likely to be lifelong.\nChanging your diet\nIn most cases, cutting down on or avoiding sources of lactose and replacing them with lactose-free alternatives is enough to control the symptoms of lactose intolerance.\nThe exact changes you need to make to your diet depend on how sensitive you are to lactose. Some people are able to tolerate some lactose in their diet without any problems, whereas others experience symptoms after consuming food containing only a tiny amount of lactose.\nIf you decide to experiment with what you can and can't eat, make sure\u00a0to introduce new foods gradually, rather than all at once. This will help you to get used to any foods you might be sensitive to and identify any that cause problems.\nEating fewer products containing lactose, or avoiding them completely, can mean you miss out on certain vitamins and minerals in your diet and increase your risk of complications. You'll also need to make sure you're getting enough\u00a0nutrition from either lacto-free foods or dietary supplements.\nIf you or your child are extremely sensitive to lactose, talk to your GP about your diet.\nMilk products are rich in calcium needed for healthy bones so you may need to have regular bone density checks.\nYou may be referred to a dietitian (an expert in diet and nutrition) who\u00a0can advise about what foods should be included in your, or your child's, diet.\nSources of lactose\nSome of the main sources of lactose you may need to cut down on or avoid if you're lactose intolerant are described below.\nA major source of lactose is milk, including cow's milk, goat's milk and sheep's milk. Depending on how mild or severe your lactose intolerance is, you may need to change the amount of milk in your diet.\nFor example:\n\nyou may be able to have milk in your tea or coffee, but not on your cereal\nsome products containing milk, such as milk chocolate, may still be acceptable in small quantities\nyou may find that drinking milk as part of a meal, rather than on its own, improves how the lactose is absorbed\n\nIf even a small amount of milk triggers your symptoms, there are some alternatives you can try, such as soya or rice milk (see below).\nOther dairy products made from milk, such as butter, ice cream and cheese, can also contain high levels of lactose and may need to be avoided if you're lactose intolerant.\nSome dairy products however, such as hard cheese and yoghurt, contain lower levels of lactose than milk and other products, so you may still be able to have them.\nIt's worth experimenting with different foods to find out if there are any dairy products you can eat because they're a good source of\u00a0essential nutrients such as\u00a0calcium.\nAs well as milk and dairy products, there are other foods and drinks that can sometimes contain lactose.\nThese include:\n\nsalad cream, salad dressing and mayonnaise\nbiscuits\nchocolate\nboiled sweets\ncakes\nsome types of bread and other baked goods\nsome breakfast cereals\npackets of mixes to make pancakes and biscuits\npackets of instant potatoes and instant soup\nsome processed meats, such as sliced ham\n\nCheck the ingredients of all food and drink products carefully, because milk or lactose are often hidden ingredients.\nThe lactose found in some foods\u00a0won't necessarily be listed separately on the food label, so you need to check the ingredients list for milk, whey, curds and milk\u00a0products such as cheese, butter and cream.\nSome ingredients may sound like they contain lactose when they don't, such as\u00a0lactic acid, sodium lactate and cocoa butter. These ingredients don't need to be avoided if you're lactose intolerant.\nSome prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines and complementary medicines may contain a small amount of lactose. While this isn't usually enough to trigger the symptoms of lactose intolerance in most people, it may cause problems if your intolerance is severe or you're taking several different medicines.\nIf you need to start taking a new medication, check with your GP or pharmacist in case it contains lactose.\nLactose-free foods and drinks\nThere are a number of alternative foods and drinks available in supermarkets to replace the milk and dairy products you need to avoid.\nFood and drinks that don't usually contain lactose include:\n\nsoya milks, yoghurts and some cheeses\nmilks made from rice, oats, almonds, hazelnuts, coconut, quinoa, and potato\nfoods which carry the 'dairy-free' or 'suitable for vegans' signs\ncarob bars\n\nYou can also buy cow's milk containing additional lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose). This means you still get the nutritional benefits of the milk, but you're less likely to experience any symptoms after consuming it.\nGetting enough calcium\nIf you're unable to eat most dairy products, you may not be getting enough calcium in your daily diet.\u00a0Calcium has several important functions, including:\n\nhelping build strong bones and teeth\nregulating muscle contractions (including heartbeat)\nensuring blood clots normally\n\nTherefore, it's a good idea\u00a0to choose lactose-free products with added calcium and ensure your diet contains alternative sources of calcium, such as:\n\ngreen leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage and okra\nsoya beans\ntofu\nnuts\nbread and anything made with fortified flour\nfish containing edible bones (for example, sardines, salmon, and pilchards)\n\nYou can also buy combined calcium and vitamin D supplements from most pharmacists to help maintain good bone health.\nIt's important to check with your GP or dietitian whether you should be taking supplements, however, as taking excessively high levels of calcium can cause side effects.\nLactase substitutes\nIn addition to dietary changes, you may also find it useful to take\u00a0liquid drops, tablets or capsules that contain\u00a0lactase substitutes. These are available from most health foods shops.\nLactase substitutes replace the lactase your small intestine isn't producing, which\u00a0can reduce your symptoms by helping your body break down any lactose in your diet more easily.\nLactase substitutes\u00a0can either be added to milk\u00a0or taken just\u00a0before eating a meal containing lactose.\nLactose intolerance in children\nIf your child is lactose intolerant, they may be able to consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing symptoms. This is quite safe, but you may need to experiment to find out how much they can comfortably eat or drink.\nIf your child is unable to tolerate any lactose, your doctor\u00a0may refer you to a dietitian for nutritional advice because it's important\u00a0for young children to have certain nutrients in their diet to ensure healthy growth and development.\nIn general, the same rules about foods to try or to avoid are similar for children and adults (see above).\nFor babies with lactose intolerance, lactose-free formula milk is available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets. However, soya formula isn't recommended for children under six months because it contains hormones that may interfere with your baby's future physical and sexual development.\nBreastfed babies may benefit from lactase substitute drops to help their bodies digest the lactose in breast milk.\nFor many children, lactose intolerance is only temporary and will improve after a few weeks. After this point it's safe to gradually reintroduce milk and dairy products into their diet.\n\n\nMilk and other dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet. They contain calcium, protein and vitamins such as vitamins A, B12 and D.\nLactose is also important because it helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, including magnesium and zinc. These vitamins and minerals are important for the development of strong, healthy bones.\nIf you are lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and\u00a0put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions.\n\nOsteopenia \u2013 where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis \u2013 where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased.\nMalnutrition \u2013 when the food you eat does not give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you are malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed.\n\nIf you are concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements.\nYour GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician.

It plays an important\u00a0role in helping you breathe and speak.\nThe condition is more common in people over the age of 60. It's about 4 times more common in men than women.\nSymptoms of laryngeal cancer\nThe main symptoms of laryngeal cancer include:\n\na change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse\npain when swallowing\u00a0or\u00a0difficulty swallowing\u00a0\na lump or swelling in your neck\na\u00a0long-lasting cough\na persistent\u00a0sore throat or earache\nin severe cases, difficulty breathing\n\nSome people may also experience\u00a0bad breath, breathlessness, a high-pitched wheezing noise\u00a0when\u00a0breathing, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue (extreme tiredness).\nWhen to speak to your GP\nYou should speak to your GP if you have had\u00a0any of the main symptoms for more than 3 weeks.\nThese symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions, such as laryngitis, but it's a good idea to get them checked out.\nIf necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer.\nRead more about diagnosing laryngeal cancer.\nWhat causes laryngeal cancer?\nIt's not clear exactly what causes laryngeal cancer, but your risk of getting the condition is increased by:\n\nsmoking tobacco\nregularly drinking large amounts of alcohol\nhaving a family history of head and neck cancer\nhaving an unhealthy diet\nexposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust\n\nBy adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of laryngeal cancer\u00a0and preventing laryngeal cancer.\nHow laryngeal cancer is treated\nThe main treatments for laryngeal cancer\u00a0are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.\nRadiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it's diagnosed early.\nIf the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used.\nIf you have surgery to remove your larynx, you'll no longer\u00a0be able to speak or breathe in the usual way. Instead, you will breathe through a permanent hole in your neck (stoma) and you will need additional treatment to help restore your voice.\nThis may include an implant in your throat, or an electrical device\u00a0you hold against your throat to produce sound.\nRead more about\u00a0treating laryngeal cancer\u00a0and recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery.\n\n\nLaryngeal cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the larynx, although it's not clear exactly why this happens.\nAll cancers begin with a change in\u00a0a cell's\u00a0DNA.\u00a0DNA provides our cells with a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce.\nA change in\u00a0DNA can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means cells continue to grow instead of stopping when they should. This causes the cells to reproduce in an uncontrollable manner, producing a growth of tissue called a tumour.\nIt's not known why the DNA inside the cells of the larynx is affected in cases of laryngeal cancer. But it appears that exposure to\u00a0things that can damage the cells and tissue of the larynx increases the risk of cancer developing.\nWhat can increase your risk?\nA\u00a0number of things can increase your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.\nAlcohol and tobacco are the 2 main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. They're\u00a0thought to contain chemicals that can damage the cells of the larynx.\nThe\u00a0more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\nPeople who smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, or people who have smoked for more than 40 years, have been found to be about 40 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer than\u00a0people who don't smoke.\nCompared to people who don't drink, people who regularly drink large amounts of alcohol are about 3 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer.\nIf you drink and smoke, your risk of laryngeal cancer increases even further. By stopping both drinking and smoking, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing the condition. Read more about preventing laryngeal cancer.\nPeople who have a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) diagnosed with head or neck\u00a0cancer are thought to be twice as likely to develop laryngeal cancer as someone without a family history.\nThere's evidence to suggest that a diet high in red meat, processed food and fried food\u00a0might increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\nHaving\u00a0a 'Mediterranean diet' or a diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables may reduce your risk.\u00a0Read more about preventing laryngeal cancer.\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV)\u00a0is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix (neck of the womb), anus, mouth and throat.\nHPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to\u00a0cervical cancer. It's thought the virus may have a similar effect on the cells of the throat. HPV is often spread during sex, including oral sex.\nHaving a job where you're exposed to high levels of certain substances may also increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. These include:\n\nasbestos\ncoal or wood dust\npaint or diesel fumes\nnickel\nsulphuric acid fumes\nformaldehyde (a chemical\u00a0used in a wide range of industrial processes, such as paint manufacturing and cosmetics)\nisopropyl alcohol (often used as a cleaning solvent)\n\n\n\nIf you have symptoms of laryngeal cancer, such as a hoarse voice and pain when swallowing, your GP will ask about your symptoms and recent medical history.\nThey may also examine the inside and outside of your throat for abnormalities, such as lumps and swellings.\nIf laryngeal cancer is suspected, you'll probably be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your local hospital for further testing.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that\u00a0anyone aged 45\u00a0or over with persistent unexplained hoarseness or an unexplained lump in their neck should have an appointment with a specialist within 2 weeks.\nNasendoscopy\nA nasendoscopy is a procedure used to get a clear view of your larynx.\nDuring the procedure, a small, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end (endoscope) is\u00a0inserted into your nostril and passed down the back of your throat. The images from the endoscope are displayed on a monitor.\nYou'll usually be awake while this is carried out and it may feel uncomfortable.\u00a0A\u00a0local anaesthetic spray is\u00a0sometimes used to numb your nose and throat beforehand, so you don't feel any pain.\nLaryngoscopy\nIf it wasn't possible to get a good view of your larynx during a nasendoscopy, or a possible problem is spotted, you may have a further test called a laryngoscopy.\nLike a nasendoscopy, this procedure involves using an endoscope to examine your larynx. However, the endoscope used during a laryngoscopy is longer and inserted through the mouth. This allows the larynx to be seen in greater detail.\nA laryngoscopy\u00a0can be very uncomfortable, so it's usually carried out under\u00a0general anaesthetic (where you're asleep). You should be able to leave hospital as soon as you've recovered from the effects of anaesthetic, which is usually the same day or the day after.\nBiopsy\nDuring a\u00a0nasendoscopy or\u00a0laryngoscopy, your doctor may use small instruments to remove a sample of cells from your larynx so it can be examined for signs of cancer. This is known as a\u00a0biopsy.\nAlternatively, if you have a lump in your neck, a needle and syringe can be used to\u00a0remove a tissue sample. This is known as fine needle aspiration.\nFurther testing\nIf the results of the biopsy show you have cancer and there's a risk it may have spread, you'll probably be referred for further testing to assess how widespread the cancer is. The tests may include:\n\na computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed three-dimensional picture of your larynx and the surrounding tissue\na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013\u00a0a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce a more detailed image of your larynx and the surrounding tissue\na PET-CT scan\u00a0\u2013 a CT scan is used to take pictures of the inside of your body after you've been injected with\u00a0a mildly radioactive substance that helps to show cancerous areas more clearly\nan ultrasound scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0high-frequency sound waves are used to check for signs of cancer in the lymph nodes (glands found throughout the body) near the larynx\n\nStaging and grading\nAfter these tests have been completed, your doctor should be able to tell you the extent of the cancer. This is known as the stage and grade of the cancer.\nHealthcare professionals use a system called the TNM system to stage laryngeal cancer. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nthe T stage is given as a number from 1\u00a0to 4 \u2013 small tumours confined to 1 part of the larynx are described as T1 tumours and large tumours that have grown into tissues outside the larynx are described as T4\nthe N stage is given as a number from 0\u00a0to 3 \u2013 N0 means the lymph nodes are not affected, whereas stages N2 to N3 mean that 1 or more lymph nodes are affected\nthe M stage is given as either M0 or M1 \u2013 M0 means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and M1 means that it has\n\nThere are also 3 different grades\u00a0(1\u00a0to 3) used to describe\u00a0laryngeal cancer. Lower-grade cancers, such as grade 1, tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to spread.\u00a0Higher-grade cancers, such as grade 3,\u00a0grow quickly and\u00a0are more likely to spread.\nYou can read more about the\u00a0stages and grades of laryngeal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.\n\n\nThe treatment for laryngeal cancer largely depends on the size of the cancer. The main treatments are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) of specialists that work together to decide\u00a0the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nMembers of your MDT will probably include a surgeon, a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and a specialist cancer nurse who will be responsible for co-ordinating your care.\nYour cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you'd like to ask\u00a0your care team. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nYour treatment plan\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage of the\u00a0cancer (see diagnosing laryngeal cancer for more information on staging).\nIf you have early-stage laryngeal cancer, it may be possible to remove the cancer using surgery (endoscopic resection) or\u00a0radiotherapy alone. This may also be the case with slightly larger cancers, although a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is sometimes required.\nIn later-stage laryngeal cancer, more extensive surgery may be needed. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy will probably be used in combination. In some cases, the entire larynx may have to be removed.\nA medication called cetuximab may be used in cases where chemotherapy is not suitable.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. It can be used as a treatment on its own for early-stage laryngeal cancer, or it can be used\u00a0after surgery to stop cancerous cells returning. It's sometimes combined with chemotherapy.\nThe energy beams used during radiotherapy have to be precisely targeted to your larynx.\u00a0To ensure\u00a0the beams are directed at the exact area, a special plastic mask will be made to hold your head in the right position. A mould of your face will be taken so that the mask can be made before treatment starts.\nRadiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions from Monday to Friday, with a break from treatment at the weekend. The course of treatment usually lasts for 3 to 7 weeks.\nAs well as killing cancerous cells, radiotherapy can affect healthy tissue and has a number of side effects, including:\n\nsore, red skin (similar to sunburn)\nmouth ulcers\ndry mouth\nloss of taste\nloss of appetite\ntiredness\nfeeling sick\n\nYour MDT will monitor any side effects and treat them when possible. For example, protective gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers, and medicines are available for a dry mouth.\nRadiotherapy can sometimes cause your throat tissue to become inflamed. Severe inflammation can cause breathing difficulties. Contact your key worker or visit\u00a0your local accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you have difficulty breathing.\nMost side effects should pass within a few weeks of treatment finishing.\nRead more about\u00a0radiotherapy.\nSurgery\nThere are 3 types of surgery that\u00a0can be used to treat laryngeal cancer. They are:\n\nendoscopic resection\npartial laryngectomy\ntotal laryngectomy\n\nEndoscopic resection can be used\u00a0in\u00a0early-stage laryngeal cancer.\nDuring the procedure, a surgeon uses a special microscope to get a magnified view of the larynx. This allows them to remove the cancer either with a laser or small surgical instruments.\nAn endoscopic resection is carried out under general anaesthetic, so you will\u00a0be unconscious during the procedure and won't feel any pain.\nYour\u00a0mouth and throat\u00a0may feel sore for a few weeks after the operation and there's a risk of your voice changing as a result of the procedure, which can be permanent.\nA partial laryngectomy can be used to treat some laryngeal cancers. The operation involves surgically removing the affected part of your larynx. Some of your vocal cords will be left in place, so you will still be able to talk, but your voice may be quite hoarse or weak.\nWhile your larynx is healing, you may find breathing difficult. Your surgeon\u00a0may need to\u00a0create a temporary hole in your neck, which will be attached to a tube you can breathe through. This is known as a temporary tracheostomy.\nOnce your larynx has healed, the tube can be removed and the hole will heal, leaving a small scar.\nThis operation is\u00a0uncommon nowadays,\u00a0as endoscopic resection is preferred whenever possible.\nA total laryngectomy is usually used to treat advanced laryngeal cancer. The operation involves removing your entire larynx. Nearby lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) may also need to be removed if the cancer has spread to them.\nAs your vocal cords will be removed, you won't be able to speak in the usual way after the operation. However, there are several ways to help restore your speech.\nIf you have a total laryngectomy, your surgeon will also need to create a permanent hole in your neck (called a stoma) to help you breathe after the operation.\nYou will be given training on how to keep your stoma clean. Having a stoma can seem daunting and frightening at first, but most people get used to it after a few months.\nSee recovering from laryngeal cancer for more information about speaking after surgery and looking after a stoma.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicines to damage the DNA of the cancerous cells and stop them reproducing. It may be used to\u00a0shrink a tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, or in combination with radiotherapy to make the radiotherapy more effective.\nIt can also be used to\u00a0treat laryngeal cancer that's advanced or has come back after treatment. In this situation, it can relieve symptoms and may slow the cancer's growth.\nChemotherapy medication is usually given as an injection into a vein (intravenously) once every\u00a03\u00a0or 4 weeks, for up to 6 months. You may need to stay in hospital for a few days\u00a0during each treatment or you may just come in for a short visit each time.\nChemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. This, unfortunately, means side effects are common, such as:\n\nfeeling and being sick\nhair loss\nloss of appetite\ndiarrhoea\nsore mouth and mouth ulcers\ntiredness\n\nChemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illness.\nIt's therefore important to report any symptoms of potential infection to your\u00a0MDT, such as a high temperature, chills or a persistent cough. You should also avoid close contact with people\u00a0known to have an infection.\nThe\u00a0side effects of chemotherapy should improve after your treatment has finished.\nRead more about\u00a0chemotherapy.\nCetuximab\nCetuximab is a type of medication called biological therapy. These medications target and disrupt the processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce.\nCetuximab can be used in combination with radiotherapy to treat more advanced laryngeal cancer, when it's not possible to use chemotherapy. For example, people with kidney or heart disease, or people with an ongoing infection, may not be able to have chemotherapy, because it could make them very ill.\nCetuximab is given slowly\u00a0through a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to an hour or more. It's usually given weekly for\u00a0up to 7 weeks.\nSide effects of cetuximab are usually mild and include:\n\nrashes\nfeeling sick\ndiarrhoea\nbreathlessness\n\nCetuximab can also trigger allergic reactions in some people, which can cause problems such as a swollen tongue or throat. In a few cases,\u00a0the reaction can be severe and potentially life-threatening.\nMost serious reactions occur within a day of treatment starting, so you'll be closely monitored once your treatment begins. If you have symptoms of a severe\u00a0reaction, such as a rapid heartbeat or breathing problems, medication can be used to relieve them (such as corticosteroids).\n\n\nIf you've had some or all of your larynx removed (laryngectomy), it's likely that you'll need to spend 1 or 2 days in an intensive care unit until you've recovered.\nYou won't be able to eat until your throat has healed, which for most people\u00a0takes at least\u00a0a week or two. While your throat heals, you'll need to be fed through a tube that's passed\u00a0through your nose and into your stomach.\nIf you've had all of your larynx removed\u00a0(total laryngectomy), you won't be able to speak normally, because you will no longer have vocal cords.\u00a0A number of techniques can be used to replicate the functions of your vocal cords although they can take\u00a0weeks or months to learn.\nTherefore, it's likely that you'll need to use alternative methods of communicating, such as using a pen or paper,\u00a0during the first few weeks or months after surgery. This can be a frustrating experience \u2013 the loss of something you've previously taken for granted can be difficult to cope with.\nTry to prepare yourself for strangers reacting in unpredictable and possibly upsetting ways.\u00a0Some people who have had a laryngectomy have reported that other people sometimes assume they're deaf or have a learning difficulty because of their inability to speak.\nYour emotions\nThe emotional impact of living with a laryngectomy can be significant. Many people report experiencing a rollercoaster effect.\nFor example, you may feel down when laryngeal cancer is diagnosed, then feel up after the cancer has been removed, then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the practicalities of living with a laryngectomy.\nThese emotional changes can sometimes trigger feelings of depression. You may be depressed if you have felt very down during the past month and you no longer take pleasure in doing\u00a0things you enjoy.\nContact your GP or care team for advice if you think\u00a0you may be depressed. There are a range of effective treatments available.\nThe\u00a0National Association of Laryngectomee Clubs (NALC) is also a useful resource for people trying to come to terms with living with a laryngectomy. NALC is a patient support group that provides advice on all aspects of living with a laryngectomy.\nLooking after your stoma\nIf you've had all of your larynx removed, the surgeon will need to create a permanent hole in your throat through which you will breathe (a stoma). During the first few months after surgery, it's likely that your stoma will produce a lot of mucus, particularly if you've had radiotherapy.\nExcessive mucus can cause breathing difficulties, so a tube may be attached to your stoma to help you breathe more easily. Once the production of mucus has settled down, the tube can be removed.\nIt's important to clean your stoma at least once a day, otherwise it can become crusty and may become vulnerable to infection.\u00a0A specialist nurse can teach you how to keep your stoma clean.\nYou'll be given special filters to place over your stoma that can help keep your stoma moist and free of germs.\nIt's important to remember that you'll need to cover your stoma with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, rather than covering your mouth or nose. This is because mucus or saliva will come out of your stoma.\nYou can read more about adjusting to a stoma in the\u00a0Handbook for laryngectomy patients - PDF (508KB) produced by NALC.\nSpeaking after surgery\nIf your larynx has been completely removed as part of your treatment for laryngeal cancer, you'll need additional treatment to help restore your voice.\nBefore your laryngectomy, you may meet a speech and language therapist (SLT) to discuss possible treatment options for restoring your voice. An SLT is a healthcare professional who specialises in helping people who have difficulties speaking and using language.\nThere are several different treatment options.\nA voice prosthesis is an artificial valve implanted into your neck. When you want to speak, you cover the stoma and breathe out through the valve.\nThe valve produces a noise, which you can use to make words by moving your lips and mouth in the usual way. The voice that's produced by the valve sounds natural, although it may be lower-pitched than your previous voice.\nIf you choose to have a voice prosthesis, it can be fitted during the surgery to remove your larynx.\nOesophageal speech is a technique for speaking that your SLT can teach you. It involves learning to push air\u00a0through your oesophagus (gullet). As the air moves through your oesophagus, it vibrates and makes a noise. You can produce words by moving your lips and mouth.\nSome people find it quite easy to learn oesophageal speech, whereas others find it difficult. Regular practice by yourself and with your SLT can help you\u00a0improve.\nAn electrolarynx is a small, battery-operated electrical device that vibrates and produces sound. You hold the device under your chin, and as you move your mouth and lips the vibrations translate into spoken words. Your SLT can train you to use it correctly.\n\n\nIt's thought that most laryngeal cancers can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle.\nAvoiding\u00a0tobacco products, cutting down on how much alcohol you drink and\u00a0having a healthy diet are particularly important in reducing your chances of developing the condition.\nAvoiding tobacco products\nUsing tobacco products increases your chances of developing several different types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer.\nTobacco comes in many forms, including:\n\ncigarettes\npipe tobacco\ncigars\ncigarillos\nsnuff (powdered tobacco\u00a0snorted through the nose)\nchewing tobacco\n\nIf you smoke or use other tobacco products, stopping will have both short- and long-term health benefits, including significantly reducing your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\nIf you decide to stop smoking your free NHS\u00a0stop smoking service\u00a0can help you give up. You can also call Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0on\u00a00800 84 84 84 for\u00a0free expert advice and support.\nIf you want to stop\u00a0smoking, but don't want to be referred to a stop smoking service, your GP should be able to prescribe medical treatment to help with any withdrawal symptoms you may have.\nRead more about stopping smoking.\nCutting down on alcohol\nStaying within the recommended guidelines for alcohol consumption will also reduce your risk of developing laryngeal\u00a0and liver cancers.\nStudies have found that your risk of developing laryngeal cancer reduces significantly within 5\u00a0to 10 years of not drinking, and after 20\u00a0to 30 years your risk is about the same as someone who has never drunk alcohol.\nContact your GP if you're finding it difficult to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink. You may need additional treatment, which could include counselling, group work or medication.\nRead more about\u00a0treatments for alcohol misuse\u00a0and tips on cutting down how much you drink.\nHealthy diet\nResearch shows a diet that contains plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, particularly tomatoes, citrus fruit (such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons), olive oil and fish oil,\u00a0may reduce your risk of getting laryngeal cancer. This type of diet is sometimes known as a 'Mediterranean diet'.\nEating plenty of fruit\u00a0and vegetables each day may help to reduce your chances of developing many types of cancer, including laryngeal cancer.\nRead about\u00a0food and diet and healthy eating for more information and advice.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Laryngitis is inflammation of the larynx (voice box).

It's usually caused by an infection or damage to the larynx.\nInfection\nViral infections such as a\u00a0cold\u00a0or\u00a0flu are the most common type of infection associated with acute laryngitis.\nRarer types of infection include:\n\nbacterial infections \u2013 such as diphtheria\nfungal infections \u2013 such as thrush (candidiasis) or aspergillosis\n\nPeople with weakened immune systems,\u00a0caused\u00a0by conditions such as HIV or as a result of chemotherapy or steroid medication, are thought to be most at risk from fungal laryngitis.\nLaryngitis caused by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection is known as infectious laryngitis.\nDamage to the larynx\nLaryngitis is also often caused by straining your voice, such as speaking or singing for long periods or shouting and singing loudly.\nStraining your voice can cause your vocal cords to vibrate at a faster rate than they should. This excessive vibration can damage the surface of your vocal cords, causing them to become inflamed.\nLaryngitis caused by damage to the\u00a0larynx\u00a0is\u00a0known as\u00a0mechanical laryngitis.\nLess common causes of mechanical laryngitis include:\n\ndirect trauma to the larynx \u2013 such as a blow to your throat, an accident or a sports injury\nprolonged coughing\npersistent and frequent clearing of your throat\n\nOther causes\nAs well as infection and damage to the larynx, laryngitis can also be caused by:\n\nsmoking and alcohol misuse, which can dry out and irritate your larynx\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \u2013 when stomach acid leaks out of your stomach and up into your throat, where it can irritate your larynx\nallergic reactions to substances such as dust, fumes, chemicals and toxins\n\nThese causes are most often associated with long-term (chronic) laryngitis.\n\n\nLaryngitis often gets better without treatment, so you don't usually need to see your GP unless you have particularly severe or long-lasting symptoms.\nIf you see your GP with laryngitis, they'll discuss with you what could be causing the condition, including:\n\noverusing your voice\nsmoking\nmisusing alcohol\nallergies\n\nYour GP may refer you for\u00a0blood tests and\u00a0take a throat swab using a small cotton bud\u00a0on a plastic shaft. This is\u00a0to check for a possible\u00a0viral, bacterial or fungal infection.\nThey may also examine your larynx using a mirror to look for redness or swelling.\nSeeing a specialist\nIf your GP thinks you need to see a specialist, they may refer you to\u00a0an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for some of the tests described below.\nA laryngoscopy is a test that involves examining your larynx using a thin tube containing a camera and light source (endoscope), which can\u00a0be passed\u00a0into your throat through either your nose or mouth. This test allows\u00a0your doctor to assess any damage to your larynx.\nLaryngoscopies carried out through\u00a0the nose are not painful, but it can be uncomfortable and\u00a0the tube may trigger your gag reflex, which can make you feel like you want to be sick (it's highly unlikely that you actually will be sick). Local anaesthetic can be used to numb your nose and throat, which should help reduce these feelings.\nIf you're having persistent problems with your voice, you might be asked to talk or sing while your larynx is examined. This may help your doctor determine why you're having problems with your voice.\nFor laryngoscopies carried out through\u00a0the mouth, general anaesthetic\u00a0is used. This means you'll be asleep during the examination. You can often go home on the day you have this procedure, although an overnight stay in hospital is sometimes recommended.\nYour ENT specialist may also want to make sure your symptoms aren't the result of\u00a0laryngeal cancer.\u00a0\nAlcohol and tobacco are the two main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\u00a0The more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer.\nLaryngeal cancer\u00a0is uncommon, but it's important to confirm it or rule it out quickly because the sooner laryngeal cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment will be.\nTests your ENT specialist may recommend to check for laryngeal cancer include:\n\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 a series of X-rays are taken and assembled by a computer into a more detailed 3D image of your throat\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0\u2013 strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed scans of the inside of your throat\nbiopsy\u00a0\u2013 where a sample of tissue is taken during a laryngoscopy to check for the presence of cancerous cells\n\nOther tests that may also be carried out include:\n\na\u00a0skin allergy test to check whether you have an allergy to certain substances\nchest and neck\u00a0X-ray to check for any abnormalities, such as an unusual narrowing or swelling of your larynx\n\n\n\nIn most cases, laryngitis gets better within a week without treatment. See your GP if your symptoms are severe or haven't improved after two weeks.\nTreatment at home\nYou\u00a0may be able to help your recovery by:\n\nnot\u00a0smoking and avoiding smoky, dry or dusty environments\ndrinking plenty of fluids to avoid\u00a0dehydration \u2013 particularly water (avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks), even though swallowing may be painful\ntaking painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen\u00a0\u2013 which may ease any associated pain, headaches and fever\u00a0(children under the age of\u00a016\u00a0shouldn't take aspirin)\ngargling with a mouthwash of warm, salty water or an over-the-counter solution, or sucking lozenges \u2013 this may help to soothe a\u00a0sore throat\nusing menthol inhalation and air humidifiers \u2013 which may soothe your\u00a0airways and help keep\u00a0them clear\navoiding speaking when possible and only speaking softly\u00a0when you need to \u2013 but don't whisper because this can\u00a0put more strain on your larynx\n\nTreating underlying causes\nIn some cases, it's possible to treat the underlying cause of laryngitis.

Thigh muscle cramps\u00a0tend to last the longest.\nDuring a\u00a0cramping episode, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and\u00a0the feet and toes will be\u00a0stiff.\nAfter the cramps have passed, you may have\u00a0pain and tenderness in your legs for several hours.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you only get\u00a0leg cramps\u00a0occasionally, it is\u00a0not a cause for concern and a medical diagnosis is not required.\nA visit to your GP will only be necessary if you get leg cramps frequently, or if they are so\u00a0painful they disrupt your sleep and you are unable to\u00a0function normally the next day.\nYou should also visit your GP if the muscles in your legs are shrinking or becoming weaker.\nWhen to seek immediate medical advice\nThere are two situations where\u00a0leg cramps may be a sign\u00a0of a more serious underlying health condition.\nYou should seek immediate medical help if:\n\nThe cramps last longer than 10 minutes and fail to improve, despite exercise.\nCramps develop after you come\u00a0into contact with substances that could be toxic (poisonous) or infectious, for example, if you have a cut that is contaminated with soil, which can sometimes cause a bacterial infection, such as tetanus, or after being exposed to elements such as mercury or lead.\n\nIn these circumstances, contact your GP for advice immediately. If this isn't possible,\u00a0contact your local out-of-hours service\u00a0or call the\u00a0NHS 24 '111' service.\n\n\nThe cause of leg cramps is sometimes unknown (idiopathic). In other cases, there may be an underlying condition or another identifiable cause.\nIdiopathic leg cramps\nAlthough the cause of idiopathic leg cramps is unknown, there are a number of theories about what might cause idiopathic leg cramps. These include:\n\nabnormal nerve activity during sleep which causes the muscle of the leg to cramp\nexcessive strain placed on leg muscles, such as when exercising,\u00a0may cause the muscles to cramp at certain times\na sudden restriction in the blood supply to the affected muscles\n\nAlso, tendons naturally shorten over time as a person gets older, which may explain\u00a0why older people\u00a0are particularly affected by leg cramps. Tendons are tough bands of tissue that connect muscles to bone. If your\u00a0tendons become too short, they may cause the muscles connected to them to cramp.\nSecondary leg cramps\nSecondary leg cramps are caused by\u00a0an underlying condition or another\u00a0identifiable cause. These\u00a0include:\n\npregnancy: the extra weight of\u00a0pregnancy can place strain on the leg muscles, making them more vulnerable to cramping\nexercise: leg cramps are often experienced when resting after exercise\nneurological conditions (conditions that affect the nerves in your leg muscles): for example,\u00a0motor neurone disease or\u00a0peripheral neuropathy\nliver disease: if your liver stops working properly, toxins will build up in your blood, which can make your muscles go into spasm\ninfection: some types of bacterial infection, such as tetanus, can cause muscle cramps and spasm\ntoxins: in some people, high levels of toxic (poisonous) substances in the blood, such as lead or mercury, can cause leg cramps\ndehydration: in some people, low levels of water in the\u00a0body can lead to a drop in your salt levels, which can trigger muscle cramps\n\nMedication\nCertain medications have been known to cause leg cramps in a small number of people. These include:\n\ndiuretics: these remove fluid from the body and are used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure,\u00a0heart failure and some types of kidney disease\nstatins: these are\u00a0used to treat people with high cholesterol levels\u00a0in their blood\u00a0\nraloxifene: this is used to prevent osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) in women who have experienced\u00a0the\u00a0menopause\nnifedipine: this is used to treat angina and\u00a0Raynaud's phenomenon\u00a0\nnicotinic acid: this is\u00a0used to\u00a0treat high cholesterol\n\nContact your GP if you think\u00a0your medication may be causing your leg cramps as\u00a0your dosage\u00a0may need to be adjusted. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care advises you to do so.\u00a0\n\n\nIf the cause of your leg cramps is known, it may be possible to treat the underlying cause.\nFor example, secondary leg cramps that are related to liver disease are caused by high levels of toxins in the blood which trigger muscles spasms. Therefore, muscle relaxants can be used to help prevent your muscles from going into spasm.\nIf the cause of your legs cramps is unknown (primary idiopathic leg cramps), a combination of exercise and painkilling medication is usually recommended.\nExercises\nMost cases of leg cramps can be treated with exercises. There are two types of exercise that you can do:\n\nexercises you do\u00a0during an episode of cramping to relieve the pain and stop the cramping\nexercises you do during the day to reduce how often you get leg cramps\n\nThe two types of exercises are explained below.\u00a0\nDuring an episode of leg cramp, stretch and massage the affected muscle.\nFor example, if the cramp is in your calf muscle:\n\nStraighten your leg and lift your foot upwards, bending it at the ankle so that your toes point towards your shin.\nWalk around on your heels for a few minutes.\n\nTo reduce your risk\u00a0of getting\u00a0leg cramps in the future, you should do exercises to stretch the affected muscles three times a day.\nFor example, if your calf muscles are affected by cramps, the following exercise should be beneficial:\n\nstand\u00a0about a\u00a0metre away from a wall\nlean forward with your arms outstretched to touch the wall while keeping the soles of your feet flat on the floor\nhold this position for five seconds before releasing\nrepeat the exercise for five minutes\n\nFor the best results, you should repeat this exercise three times a day, including one session just before you go to bed.\nIf you find these exercises useful you can\u00a0carry on doing them for as long as you are able to.\nPainkillers\nIf you have leg pain that persists after an episode of cramping, an over-the-counter painkiller, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen may help reduce the pain.\nQuinine\nQuinine was originally designed as a medication to treat malaria. Subsequent research has found that it can also be moderately effective in reducing the frequency of leg cramps.\nHowever, there is a small chance that quinine may cause unpleasant side effects including:\n\ntinnitus (ringing in your ears)\nimpaired hearing\nheadache\u00a0\nnausea (feeling sick)\ndisturbed vision\nconfusion\nhot flushes\n\nThrombocytopenia is a\u00a0rarer but more serious complication of quinine. It occurs when the number of platelets in your blood\u00a0falls to a dangerously low level. Platelets help the blood to clot which means people with\u00a0thrombocytopenia are at increased risk of\u00a0excessive bleeding such as:\n\nnosebleeds\u00a0\nbleeding gums\nbleeding inside the eye\nbleeding inside the skull or digestive system (both of which can be fatal)\n\nThere have been a number of reported cases of people dying from thrombocytopenia after taking quinine to prevent leg cramps.\nNever take more than your recommended dose of quinine. An overdose of quinine can result in permanent blindness and death.\nDue to these small but potential risks, your GP will only prescribe quinine if there is evidence that the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risks.\nIt is recommended that quinine is only prescribed when:\n\nyou have tried the exercise techniques discussed above and they haven't helped prevent your\u00a0leg cramps\nyou have frequent leg cramps which affect your quality of life\n\nIn these circumstances, you may be prescribed a four-week course of quinine. After this time, if you have not gained any\u00a0benefit, the treatment will be withdrawn.\nIf you experience\u00a0any of the side effects listed above, stop taking quinine immediately and contact your GP.\u00a0\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Lichen planus is a non-infectious, itchy rash that can affect many areas of the body.\nAffected areas can\u00a0include the:\n\narms, legs and trunk\u00a0\nmouth (oral lichen planus)\nnails and scalp\nvulva, vagina and penis\n\nThe exact cause of lichen planus is unknown. However, the condition isn't infectious and doesn't usually run in families. It can't be passed on to other people, including sexual partners.\nA\u00a0GP can usually\u00a0diagnose lichen planus by examining the rash and asking about your symptoms. Oral lichen planus is often diagnosed by a dentist during routine dental check-ups.\nLichen planus is thought to affect 1-2% of the worldwide population. It's more common in adults over the age of 40.\nLichen planus of the skin affects men and women equally. However, oral lichen planus is more common in women. The mouth is affected in around 50% of all cases of lichen planus (oral lichen planus).\nTreating lichen planus\nThere's no single treatment that can cure lichen planus completely. However, treatments are available\u00a0to help manage the symptoms and make living with it easier. For example,\u00a0steroid creams or ointments are often used to help relieve the itch and control the rash.\nMost cases of lichen planus of the skin clear up on their own within 6\u00a0to 9\u00a0months. The rash rarely lasts longer than 18 months.\u00a0However, oral lichen planus and lichen planus that affects the genital area may be more persistent.\nRead\u00a0more\u00a0about how lichen planus is treated.\nErosive lichen planus\nErosive lichen planus is a rare form of lichen planus that can last a long time. It causes painful ulcers to develop in the mouth and in the genital areas of both\u00a0males and females.\nIn some cases, long-term erosive lichen planus can increase the chance of\u00a0some types of\u00a0cancer developing.\nRead our page on\u00a0complications of lichen planus for more information about erosive lichen planus.\n\n\nThe symptoms of lichen planus vary, depending on which area of the body is affected.\nAreas of the body most commonly affected by the condition include the:\n\nskin\nmouth\npenis\nvulva (external female sex organs) and vagina\n\nLichen planus of the skin\nThe symptoms of lichen planus of the skin are:\n\npurple-red coloured bumps (papules) that are slightly raised, shiny and have a flat top. The papules usually measure 3-5mm in diameter and may also have irregular white streaks (Wickham's striae)\nthicker scaly patches can appear, usually around the ankles \u2013 this is known as hypertrophic lichen planus\nitchy skin\n\nLichen planus of the skin often affects the wrists, ankles and lower back, although other parts of the body can also be affected.\nThickened (hypertrophic) lichen planus affects the shins, and ring-shaped lichen planus affects creases in the skin, such as the armpits.\nAfter the\u00a0papules have cleared, the affected area of skin can sometimes become discoloured.\nLichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus)\nThe symptoms of oral lichen planus are:\n\na white pattern on the tongue and inner cheeks\nred and white patches in the mouth\nburning and discomfort in the mouth while eating or drinking\npainful red gums\n\nMild cases of oral lichen planus don't usually cause any pain or discomfort.\nLichen planus of the penis\nThe symptoms of lichen planus of the penis are:\n\npurple or white ring-shaped patches on the tip of the penis (glans)\nbumps (papules) that are flat-topped and shiny\na non-itchy rash\n\nLichen planus of the vulva and vagina\nThe symptoms of lichen planus of the vulva and vagina include:\n\nsoreness, burning and rawness around the vulva\nthe vulva may be covered in white streaks and be a red, pink or pale white colour\nif the vagina is affected, sexual intercourse can be painful\nif the outer layers of skin break down, moist, red patches can form\nscar tissue can form, which distorts the shape of the vagina\na sticky yellow or green discharge,\u00a0which may be bloodstained\nthe opening of the vagina can become narrowed\n\nOther areas\nLichen planus can sometimes affect other areas, including:\n\nthe nails \u2013 which can become thinner, ridged and grooved, or they may become darker, thicker or raised; they may sometimes shed or stop growing\nthe scalp \u2013 red patches can appear around clusters of hair; in some cases, permanent\u00a0hair loss can occur\n\n\n\nThe cause of lichen planus is unknown.\nIt's thought\u00a0to be related to the immune system, or an abnormal response of the immune system to certain medicines.\nLichen planus isn't infectious, doesn't usually run in families and can't be passed on to others.\nAutoimmune reaction\nThe immune system protects your body against illness and infection\u00a0by producing antibodies (proteins)\u00a0that attack bacteria and viruses.\nIn people with lichen planus, it's thought that the immune system becomes overactive, causing an excess amount of proteins to be produced, which inflame the skin. This is known as an autoimmune reaction and causes the symptoms of lichen planus.\nReaction to medication\nA reaction to certain medications is another possible cause of lichen planus. For example:\n\ngold injections \u2013 these are disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that are sometimes injected into the muscles of people with\u00a0arthritis to help reduce inflammation and painful joints\nantimalarial tablets \u2013 these help treat and prevent\u00a0malaria (a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes)\n\n\n\nLichen planus is often diagnosed by a GP or dentist examining the affected area.\nLichen planus of the skin\nYour GP may be able to make a diagnosis based on the characteristic rash.\u00a0However, lichen planus can be mistaken for other skin conditions, such as eczema,\u00a0which also causes the skin to become red, flaky and itchy.\nIf your doctor\u00a0is unable to make a confident diagnosis by examining your skin, they may want to take a small skin sample (biopsy), which will be examined under a microscope.\nIf a skin biopsy is required, you'll be given a\u00a0local anaesthetic to numb the affected area so you don't feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure.\nLichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus)\nA dentist or doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by looking at the inside of your mouth.\nA biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. A sample\u00a0of\u00a0mouth tissue will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope.\u00a0As with lichen planus of the skin, you'll be given a local anaesthetic to numb the pain.\n\n\nThere's no cure for lichen planus, so treatments aim to ease the symptoms and clear the rash. Mild lichen planus doesn't require treatment.\nSelf-help\nBelow is some general self-help advice that can help ease your symptoms and prevent them getting worse.\n\navoid washing with soap or bubble bath \u2013 use plain warm water instead\nwash your hair over a basin to stop affected areas of skin coming into contact with shampoo\nuse an\u00a0emollient to moisturise your skin\u00a0\n\n\navoid eating spicy foods and anything acidic, such as fruit juice, because they can irritate oral lichen planus\navoid eating sharp food, such as crusty bread\navoid drinking alcohol,\u00a0particularly spirits\nif areas of your mouth are painful, stick to soft, bland foods, such as mashed potatoes and porridge\nif possible, continue to use your usual toothpaste\navoid using mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they may be too strong, and keep your mouth as clean as possible\nvisit your dentist regularly to help keep your teeth and gums healthy\n\n\navoid washing with soap or bubble bath \u2013 use plain warm water or a soap substitute instead, such as aqueous cream\nuse an emollient, such as petroleum jelly, before and after urinating\napplying ice packs to the affected areas may soothe itching\u00a0and swelling (never apply an ice pack directly to your skin \u2013 wrap\u00a0it in a clean tea towel before placing\u00a0it on your body)\nwomen should avoid wearing tights\n\nLichen planus of the skin, hair and nails\nThere are a number of\u00a0medications\u00a0and treatments that may be recommended for lichen planus of the skin, hair and nails. These are outlined below. \u00a0\nCorticosteroid creams and ointments\u00a0contain corticosteroids (artificial hormones) and are used to treat inflammatory skin conditions. They are often\u00a0referred to\u00a0as topical corticosteroids.\nTopical corticosteroids help treat the\u00a0swelling (inflammation) and redness caused by lichen planus. Strong topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are also effective in reducing any itchiness you may have.\nTreatment is applied to the red or purple itchy spots, but should be stopped when the colour of the rash changes to brown or grey. This pigment change occurs when the inflammation has settled. Continuing to apply the corticosteroid cream to the brown areas of skin will\u00a0gradually cause the skin to thin. The side effects of corticosteroids can vary, depending on the:\n\ntype and severity of treatment being used\nhow long the treatment is used for\nnature of the condition being treated\n\nPotential side effects of topical corticosteroids can include:\n\nredness or burning and stinging of the skin\nskin rash\nthinning of the skin (atrophy)\nstretch marks (striae)\u00a0\ncontact dermatitis \u2013 a condition that causes skin inflammation\nexcessive hair growth (hypertrichosis)\nlightening of the skin\n\nAlways check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\nCorticosteroid tablets\u00a0are sometimes used to treat severe cases of lichen planus, when the symptoms aren't being effectively controlled with creams or ointments.\nPossible side effects of corticosteroid tablets used on a short-term basis can include:\n\nincreased appetite\nweight gain\ninsomnia\nfluid retention (inability to pass urine)\nmood changes, such as feeling irritable or anxious\n\nOther treatments\u00a0recommended for lichen planus of the skin are outlined below.\u00a0\n\nAntihistamines \u2013 these are often used to treat symptoms of allergies, such as itchy skin. If you have lichen planus of the skin that's causing itchiness, antihistamines may be prescribed to help reduce this.\nLight treatment \u2013 there are 2\u00a0types of light treatment: ultraviolet B (UVB) and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). UVB is the most commonly used light treatment, but PUVA may be recommended in severe or widespread cases of lichen planus that don't respond to other types of treatment.\u00a0\nAcitretin \u2013 this medication is only prescribed by a specialist and is used to treat severe cases of lichen planus. The tablets have some associated side effects and may not mix well with other medicines. Your specialist can offer advice.\n\nLichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus)\nMild cases of oral lichen planus won't need any treatment. In more severe cases, treatment includes:\n\na mouthwash that contains an anaesthetic to temporarily numb the mouth, which makes eating easier\ncorticosteroid sprays, mouthwashes, pastes and dissolvable lozenges\na mouthwash or gel that contains an antiseptic to help prevent the build-up of plaque in your mouth\n\nIn more severe cases of oral lichen planus, corticosteroid tablets may also be used on a short-term basis.\nIt can be difficult to prevent oral lichen planus, but to keep the lining of your mouth healthy it's recommended that you:\n\nstop\u00a0smoking\u00a0(if you smoke)\navoid drinking large amounts of alcohol\nhave a healthy, balanced diet, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables\n\nYou should also maintain\u00a0good oral hygiene by cleaning your teeth at least\u00a0twice a day, and having regular\u00a0dental check-ups,\u00a0so that any problems with your teeth or mouth\u00a0can be identified and treated early.\nOther treatments\nIf corticosteroids are not effective in treating your symptoms, you may be prescribed a medication that suppresses your immune system to try to limit the autoimmune reaction that's thought to cause lichen planus.\nThese types of treatments are known as immunomodulating agents. Depending on which area of your body is affected by lichen planus, treatments that may be recommended for you can include: treatments such as tacrolimus\u00a0\n\ntopical immunomodulating agents\u00a0(used to treat lichen planus of the skin) \u2013 treatments such as tacrolimus\u00a0ointment and\u00a0pimecrolimus cream are rubbed directly onto the skin\nimmunomodulating agents\u00a0(used to treat lichen planus of the mouth) \u2013 these are usually available in the form of tablets or capsules, and can be used to treat severe cases of oral lichen planus\n\nThese treatments can cause\u00a0a number of different side effects, which your specialist can discuss with you.\nYou'll also need to have regular blood tests while taking immunomodulating agents, particularly in\u00a0the early stages of treatment.\nFurther information and support\nYou can find support and information from organisations like:\n\nChanging Faces \u2013 a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice\n\n\n\nComplications of lichen planus may include discoloured skin and, in some cases, erosive lichen planus may develop into certain types of cancer.\nSkin pigmentation\nAfter the lichen planus rash has cleared up, the affected area of skin may be a different colour to what it was originally. There may be a brown or grey mark, which can sometimes last for months. This is known as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and tends to be more noticeable in people with darker skin.\nErosive lichen planus\nErosive lichen planus is a long-lasting (chronic) form of lichen planus that causes painful ulcers to develop, as well as burning and discomfort in the genital areas of both\u00a0male and females.\nOccasionally, in around 2% of cases, long-term cases of erosive lichen planus can develop into certain types of\u00a0cancer, such as:\n\nmouth cancer\u00a0\u00a0\nvulval cancer\u00a0\npenile cancer\n\nRegularly examining yourself and being aware of any changes that occur will help you to identify any problems at an early stage. Pay close attention to ulcerated areas in your mouth or genitals that don't heal and persist for a long time. Visit your GP immediately if you notice any changes that you're concerned about.\nYou should also visit your dentist regularly to ensure that your teeth and gums remain healthy, and that any ulcers or patches that form in your mouth are examined and treated promptly. Depending on individual circumstances, dental\u00a0check-ups for adults\u00a0are recommended anywhere between every 3 to 24 months.\nRead more about\u00a0treating lichen planus, including self-help tips for managing all types of the condition.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Primary liver cancer is an uncommon but serious type of cancer that begins in the liver.\nThis is a separate condition from secondary liver cancer, which occurs when cancer that first develops in another part of the body spreads to the liver.\nThe rest of this article refers to primary liver cancer only.

However, the chances of developing the condition are high for people with risk factors for the condition.\nThe number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. Around 2 in every 3 cases affect men.\nOver the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity.\u00a0\nDiagnosis and screening\nLiver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a GP and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver.\nHowever, regular check-ups for liver cancer (known as surveillance) are often recommended for people known to have a high risk of developing the condition, such as those with cirrhosis.\nHaving regular check-ups helps ensure the condition is diagnosed early. The earlier\u00a0liver cancer is diagnosed, the more effective\u00a0treatment is likely to be.\nRead\u00a0more about diagnosing liver cancer.\nHow liver cancer is treated\nTreatment for liver cancer depends on the stage the condition is at. If diagnosed\u00a0early, it may be possible to remove the cancer completely.\nTreatment options in the early stages of liver cancer include:\n\nsurgical resection \u2013 surgery to remove a section of liver\nliver transplant\u00a0\u2013 where the liver is replaced with a donor's liver\nmicrowave or radiofrequency ablation \u2013 where microwaves or radio waves are used to destroy the cancerous cells\n\nHowever, only a small proportion of liver cancers are diagnosed at a stage where these treatments are suitable. Most people are diagnosed when the cancer has spread too far to be removed or completely destroyed.\nIn these cases, treatments such as chemotherapy will be used to\u00a0slow down\u00a0the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms such as pain and discomfort.\nRead more about\u00a0treating liver cancer.\n\n\nThe exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but many cases are linked to a problem with the liver called cirrhosis. This is where the tissue of the liver has become scarred and cannot perform many of its usual functions.\nCancer is a condition\u00a0where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nIn cases of liver cancer, it is uncertain why and how the cells of the liver are affected, but it appears that cirrhosis can increase a person's chances of developing the condition.\nHowever, most cases of cirrhosis do not lead to liver cancer, and people without cirrhosis can\u00a0also develop liver cancer.\nCommon causes of cirrhosis\nThe liver is a tough and resilient organ. It can endure a high level of damage that would destroy other organs and is capable of regenerating itself. But despite the liver's resilience, excessive alcohol intake over many years can damage it.\nEvery time you drink alcohol, your liver filters out the poisonous alcohol from your blood and some of the liver cells die. The liver can regenerate new cells, but if you drink heavily for many years, your liver will lose the ability to do this and it can become damaged and scarred over time.\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease\u00a0occurs when small deposits of fat build up inside the tissue of the liver.\u00a0It's a\u00a0common condition and causes no noticeable symptoms in most people.\nHowever, in some people, high levels of fat can make the liver inflamed. Over time, the inflammation\u00a0can scar the liver.\nThe exact cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unclear, but it is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.\nA long-term infection of hepatitis C\u00a0can cause inflammation and scarring of the liver.\u00a0\nHepatitis C is spread by blood contact. The most\u00a0common ways this happens worldwide\u00a0include poor medical practice with the use of contaminated needles, or injected drug use, where any item of injecting equipment (not just needles) is shared.\nIf you smoke or regularly drink alcohol and have hepatitis C, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.\nEarly treatment of long-term hepatitis C with antiviral medication can prevent the liver from becoming scarred.\nOther\u00a0causes of cirrhosis\nHepatitis B\u00a0is a virus that can be spread through contaminated blood and other types of bodily fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal fluids.\nLike hepatitis C, hepatitis B is spread through blood contact. It is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth or from child to child in early life (usually in areas outside the UK where the infection is very common), and very rarely sexually or through injecting drugs.\nIt affects about\u00a01 in every 200 people\u00a0in the UK. Most of those infected were born in\u00a0parts of the world where the hepatitis B\u00a0virus is very common.\nAs with hepatitis C, hepatitis B can also cause inflammation and scarring of the liver over time.\nIf you smoke or drink and have hepatitis B, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases.\nEarly treatment of long-term hepatitis B with antiviral medication is not always needed, but can substantially reduce the risk of the liver becoming scarred.\nHaemochromatosis\u00a0is a genetic condition where the body stores too much iron from food.\nThe excess levels of iron have a poisonous effect on the liver and cause scarring over time, although treatment can reduce the risk of the condition leading to liver cancer.\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis\u00a0is a rare and poorly understood liver condition.\nOne of the main functions of the liver is to create a\u00a0fluid called bile, used by the body to help break down fat. The bile is transported to the digestive system via a series of tubes called bile ducts.\nFor reasons that are unclear, in cases of primary biliary cirrhosis, the bile ducts gradually become\u00a0damaged. This eventually leads to a build-up of bile inside the liver, which damages the liver and causes cirrhosis.\n\n\nFor many people, the first stage of diagnosing liver cancer is a consultation with a GP, although people at risk are usually tested regularly for the condition.\nIf you visit your GP, they will ask about your symptoms,\u00a0when they started, and when they are noticeable. They will also examine you.\nIf they feel\u00a0you need further tests, they will refer you to a hospital specialist.\u00a0\nSurveillance for liver cancer\nIf you are in a high-risk group for developing liver cancer, regular screening\u00a0\u2013 known as surveillance\u00a0\u2013 is often recommended. This is because the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chance there is of curing it.\nSurveillance is usually carried out every 6 months and\u00a0often involves:\n\nultrasound scans\u00a0\u2013 high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of your liver, which can highlight any abnormalities\nblood tests\u00a0\u2013\u00a0your blood is tested for a protein called\u00a0alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is\u00a0found in some people with liver cancer\n\nSurveillance is usually recommended if you have cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), although there are other factors that can also affect your risk of liver\u00a0cancer.\nThe potential benefits of surveillance should\u00a0be discussed with you before\u00a0you enter\u00a0any screening programme.\nFurther testing\nThe tests above can also be used to look for liver cancer in people who are not being routinely screened.\nIf these initial\u00a0tests suggest there is a chance you could have liver cancer, one or multiple tests will usually be recommended to confirm the diagnosis.\nThe further tests include:\n\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scans \u2013\u00a0a series of X-rays of your liver are\u00a0taken to give\u00a0a more detailed three-dimensional image\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\u00a0\u2013 uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to build up a picture of the inside of your liver\nbiopsy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a needle is inserted into your abdomen (tummy)\u00a0to remove a small sample of liver tissue, which is then tested in a laboratory for cancerous cells\nlaparoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a small incision is made in your abdomen under general anaesthetic (where you are asleep) and a flexible camera called an endoscope is used to examine your liver\n\nAfter\u00a0these tests have been carried out, it will usually be possible to confirm a diagnosis of liver cancer and determine the condition's stage.\nStaging liver cancer\nStaging is a term used to describe how far a particular cancer has spread. There are a number of different systems used to stage liver cancer.\nMany liver cancer specialists use combination staging systems that include features of both the cancer and the underlying liver function to stage a person's condition.\nThis is because the length of time a person lives and how well they\u00a0tolerate potential treatments will be determined not only by how advanced their cancer is, but also by their level of health and how good their underlying liver function is.\nOne combination system for staging liver cancer is known as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The BCLC staging system consists of 5 stages. These are:\n\nstage 0 \u2013\u00a0the tumour is less than 2cm (20mm) in diameter and the person is very well and has normal liver function\nstage A \u2013\u00a0a single tumour has grown but is less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter, or there are 3 or fewer smaller tumours\u00a0less than 3cm (30mm) in diameter and the person is very well with normal liver function\nstage B \u2013 there are multiple tumours in the liver, but the person is well and their liver function is unaffected\nstage C \u2013\u00a0any of the above circumstances, but the person is not so well and their liver function is not so good, or where the cancer has started to spread into the main blood vessel of the liver, nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body\nstage D \u2013\u00a0where the liver has lost most of its functioning abilities and the person begins to have symptoms of end-stage liver disease, such as a build-up of fluid inside their abdomen\n\n\n\nThe treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage of the condition. Treatment can include surgery and medication.\nCancer treatment teams\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat liver cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nDeciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nYour treatment plan\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage your liver cancer is at.\nIf your cancer is at stage A when diagnosed, a complete cure may be possible. The 3 main ways this can be achieved are:\n\nremoving the affected section of liver \u2013 known as a resection\nhaving a liver transplant \u2013 an operation to remove the liver and replace it with a healthy one\nusing heat to kill cancerous cells \u2013 known as microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA)\n\nIf your cancer is at stage B or C, a cure is not usually possible. However, chemotherapy can slow the progression of the cancer, relieve symptoms, and prolong life for months or, in some cases, years. There is also a medication called sorafenib that\u00a0can help prolong life.\nIf your cancer is at stage D when diagnosed, it is usually too late to slow down the spread of the cancer. Instead, treatment focuses on relieving\u00a0any\u00a0symptoms of pain and discomfort you may have.\nSurgical resection\nIf damage to your liver is minimal and the cancer is contained in a small part of your liver, it may be possible to remove the cancerous cells during surgery. This procedure is known as surgical resection.\nAs the liver can regenerate itself, it may be possible to remove a large section of it without seriously affecting your health. However, in the majority of people with liver cancer, their liver's regenerative ability may be significantly impaired and resection may be unsafe.\nWhether or not a resection can be performed is often determined by assessing the severity of your cirrhosis (scarring of the liver).\nIf a liver resection is recommended, it will be carried out under a general anaesthetic, which means you will be asleep during the procedure and won't feel any pain as it is carried out.\nMost people are well enough to leave hospital within a week or two of having surgery. However, depending on how much of your liver was removed, it may take several months for you to fully recover.\nLiver resection is a complicated surgery and can have a considerable impact on your body. There is a significant risk of complications occurring during and after surgery.\nPossible complications of liver resection include:\n\ninfection at the site of the surgery\nbleeding after the surgery\nblood clots that develop in your legs \u2013 the medical term for this is deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\nbile leaking from the liver \u2013 further surgery may be required to stop the leak\njaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\nliver failure (where your liver is no longer able to function properly)\n\nLiver resection can also sometimes cause fatal complications, such as a heart attack.\u00a0\nLiver transplant\nA liver transplant involves removing a cancerous liver and replacing it with a healthy\u00a0liver from a donor.\nThis is a major operation and there is a risk of potentially life-threatening complications.\u00a0\nA liver transplant may be suitable for you if you:\n\nonly have a single tumour less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter\nhave 3 or fewer small tumours, each less than 3cm (30mm)\nhave responded exceptionally well to other treatments, with no evidence of tumour growth for 6 months\n\nIf you have multiple tumours or a tumour larger than 5cm, the risk of the cancer returning is usually so high that a liver transplant will be of no benefit.\nIf you are suitable for a liver transplant, you will normally need to be placed on a waiting list until a donor liver becomes available. The average waiting time for a liver transplant is 142 days for adults.\nIn some cases, a small part of the liver of a living relative can be used. This is known as a living donor liver transplant.\nThe advantage of using a living donor liver transplant is that the person receiving the transplant can plan the procedure with their medical team and relative, and will not usually have to wait very long.\nRead more about liver transplants.\nMicrowave or radiofrequency ablation\nMicrowave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be recommended as an alternative to surgery to treat liver cancer at an early stage, ideally when the tumour or tumours are smaller than 5cm (50mm) in diameter.\nThey can also be used to treat tumours larger than this, but the treatment may need to be repeated in such cases.\nThese treatments involve heating the tumours with microwaves or radio waves produced by small, needle-like electrodes. This heat kills the cancer cells and causes the tumours to shrink.\nSimilar procedures using lasers or freezing can also achieve the same result.\nThere are 3 main ways microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out:\n\nwhere the needles are passed through the skin (percutaneously)\nwhere the needles are inserted through small incisions in your abdomen\u00a0\u2013 'keyhole' surgery (laparoscopy)\nwhere the needles are inserted through a single large incision made in your abdomen\u00a0\u2013 'open' surgery\n\nContinuous ultrasound or computerised tomography (CT) scans are used to make sure the needles are guided into the correct position.\nMicrowave ablation or RFA can be carried out under general anaesthetic or\u00a0local anaesthetic (where you are awake but the area being treated is numbed), depending on the technique used and the size of the area being treated.\nHow long it takes to carry out the treatment depends on the size and number of tumours being treated, but it usually takes between 1 and 3 hours in total. Most people need to stay overnight in hospital.\nYou may experience some minor discomfort and\u00a0flu-like symptoms, such as chills and muscle pains, for a few days after the procedure.\nThe risk of complications occurring with microwave ablation or RFA is low, but possible problems can include bleeding, infection, minor burns and damage to nearby organs.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0uses powerful cancer-killing medications to slow the spread of liver cancer.\nA type of chemotherapy called transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is usually recommended to treat cases of stage B and C liver cancer. In these cases, the treatment can prolong life, but cannot cure the cancer.\nTACE may also be used to help prevent cancer spreading out of the liver in people waiting for a liver transplant.\nIt\u00a0is not recommended for stage D liver cancer because it can make the symptoms of liver disease worse.\nDuring TACE a fine tube called a catheter is inserted\u00a0into the main blood vessel in your groin (femoral artery) and passed along the artery\u00a0to the main blood vessel that carries blood to the liver (hepatic artery).\nChemotherapy medication is injected directly into the liver through the catheter and either a gel or small plastic beads are injected into the blood vessels supplying the tumours to help slow down the speed they grow.\nTACE usually takes one to 2 hours to complete. After the procedure, you will stay in hospital overnight before returning home.\nThis procedure can be completed several times if necessary.\nInjecting chemotherapy medications directly into the liver, rather than into the blood, has the advantage of avoiding the wide range of side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, such as hair loss and tiredness.\nHowever, the procedure is not free of side effects and complications. The most common side effect is post-chemoembolisation syndrome, which can cause abdominal (tummy) pain and a high temperature (fever), as well as making you vomit or feel sick.\nThese symptoms may last for a few weeks after a TACE session.\nRead more about chemotherapy.\nAlcohol injections\nIf you only have a few small tumours, alcohol (ethanol) injections may be used as a treatment.\u00a0A needle passes through the skin to inject alcohol into the cancerous cells. This dehydrates the cells and stops their blood supply.\nIn most cases, this is carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area is numbed so you won't feel any pain.\nSorafenib\nSorafenib is a medication given in tablet form that can disrupt the blood supply to liver tumours and slow down their growth.\nIt is sometimes used as a treatment for advanced cases of liver cancer, although it is not routinely available on the NHS because the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said the cost of the medication is high for the limited benefit it offers.\nWhether or not you are eligible for sorafenib will be decided by your medical team, and will depend on the likelihood of whether\u00a0you will significantly benefit from the medication.\nFor more information, see the NICE guidelines on sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.\nAdvanced liver cancer\nTreatment for advanced liver cancer focuses on relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort, rather than attempting to slow down the progression of the cancer.\nSome people with advanced liver cancer require strong painkillers, such as codeine or possibly morphine. Nausea and constipation are common side effects of these types of painkillers, so you may also be given an anti-sickness tablet and a laxative.\nRead more about end of life care.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer.\u00a0\nThere are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including:\n\na persistent cough\ncoughing up blood\npersistent breathlessness\nunexplained tiredness and weight loss\nan ache or pain when breathing or coughing\n\nYou should speak to your GP if you have these symptoms.\nRead more about the symptoms of lung cancer\nTypes of lung cancer\nCancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This\u00a0page is about\u00a0primary lung cancer.\nThere are 2 main types of primary lung cancer.\u00a0These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. They are:\n\nnon-small-cell lung cancer \u2013 the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either\u00a0squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma\nsmall-cell lung cancer \u2013\u00a0a less common type that\u00a0usually spreads\u00a0faster than non-small-cell lung cancer\n\nThe type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing lung cancer\nWho's affected\nLung cancer mainly affects older people.\u00a0It's\u00a0rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. Lung cancer is most commonly\u00a0diagnosed in people aged 70\u00a0to 74.\nAlthough people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause (accounting for over 85% of cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances.\nRead more about:\n\ncauses of lung cancer\npreventing lung cancer\n\nTreating lung cancer\nTreatment depends on the type of cancer, how far it's spread and how good your general health is.\nIf the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung is usually recommended.\nIf surgery is unsuitable due to your general health,\u00a0radiotherapy\u00a0to destroy the cancerous cells may be recommended instead.\nIf the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective,\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0is usually used.\nRead more about treating lung cancer\n\n\nSymptoms of lung cancer develop as the condition progresses and there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages.\nThe main symptoms of lung cancer are:\n\na\u00a0cough that doesn\u2019t go away after 2 or 3 weeks\na long-standing cough that\u00a0gets worse\npersistent chest infections\ncoughing up blood\nan ache or pain when breathing or coughing\npersistent breathlessness\npersistent tiredness or lack of energy\nloss of appetite or unexplained weight loss\n\nLess common symptoms of lung cancer include:\n\nchanges in the appearance of your fingers, such as becoming more curved or their ends becoming larger (this is known as finger clubbing)\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\u00a0\ndifficulty swallowing\u00a0or pain when swallowing\nwheezing\na hoarse voice\u00a0\nswelling of your face or neck\npersistent chest or shoulder pain\n\nIf you have any of these, you should speak to your GP.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Symptoms of lung cancer\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Signs and Symptoms of lung cancer\u00a0\n\n\n\nMost cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking, although people who have never smoked can also develop the condition.\nSmoking\nSmoking cigarettes is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer.\u00a0It's responsible for more than 85% of all cases.\nTobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can\u00a0lead to\u00a0the development of cancer. These substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing).\nIf you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker.\nWhile smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as oesophageal cancer and mouth cancer. These products include:\n\ncigars\npipe tobacco\nsnuff (a powdered form of tobacco)\nchewing tobacco\n\nSmoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco.\u00a0While they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer.\nIt's been\u00a0estimated that smoking 4 joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes.\nEven smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. This is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer.\nPassive smoking\nIf you don't smoke, frequent exposure to other people\u2019s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer.\nFor example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner.\nRadon\nRadon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that\u00a0comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings.\nIf radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you're a smoker.\u00a0\nOccupational exposure and pollution\nExposure to certain chemicals and substances used in several occupations and industries has been linked to a slightly higher risk of developing lung cancer. These chemicals and substances include:\n\narsenic\nasbestos\nberyllium\ncadmium\ncoal and coke fumes\nsilica\nnickel\n\nRead more information about\u00a0asbestosis and silicosis.\nResearch\u00a0also suggests that being exposed to large amounts of diesel fumes for many years may increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 50%. One study has shown that your risk of developing lung cancer increases by about a third if you live in an area with high levels of nitrogen oxide gases (mostly produced by cars and other vehicles).\nRead further information about the\u00a0causes and risk factors for lung cancer\n\n\nSpeak to your GP if you have symptoms of lung cancer, such as breathlessness or a persistent cough.\nYour GP will ask about your general health and what symptoms you've been experiencing. They may examine you and ask you to breathe into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air you breathe in and out.\nYou may be asked to have a\u00a0blood test to rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms, such as a chest infection.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of lung cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected lung cancer.\nChest X-ray\nA chest X-ray is usually the first test used to diagnose lung cancer. Most lung tumours show up on X-rays as a white-grey mass.\nHowever, chest X-rays can't give a definitive diagnosis because they often can't distinguish between cancer and other conditions, such as a lung abscess (a collection of pus that forms in the lungs).\nIf your chest X-ray suggests you may have lung cancer, you should be referred to a specialist (if you haven't already) in chest conditions such as lung cancer. A specialist can carry out more tests to investigate whether you have lung cancer and, if you do,\u00a0what type it is\u00a0and how much it's spread.\nCT scan\nA computerised tomography (CT) scan is usually carried out after a chest X-ray. A CT scan\u00a0uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of your body.\nBefore having a CT scan, you'll be given an injection of a contrast medium. This is a liquid containing a dye that makes the lungs show up more clearly on the scan. The scan is painless and takes 10 to 30 minutes to complete.\nPET-CT scan\nA PET-CT scan (which stands for positron emission tomography-computerised tomography) may be carried out if the results of the CT scan show you have cancer at an early stage.\nThe PET-CT scan can show where there are active cancer cells. This can help with diagnosis and treatment.\nBefore having a PET-CT scan, you'll be injected with a slightly radioactive material. You'll be asked to lie down on a table, which slides into the PET scanner. The scan is painless and takes around 30 to 60 minutes.\nBronchoscopy and biopsy\nIf the CT scan shows there might be cancer in the central part of your chest, you'll have a bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a procedure\u00a0that allows\u00a0a doctor or nurse to\u00a0remove a small sample of cells from inside your lungs.\nDuring a bronchoscopy, a thin tube called a bronchoscope is used to examine your lungs and take a sample of cells (biopsy). The bronchoscope is passed through your mouth or nose, down your throat and into the airways of your lungs.\nThe procedure may be uncomfortable, but you'll be given a mild sedative beforehand to help you relax and a\u00a0local anaesthetic to make your throat numb. The procedure is very quick and only takes a few minutes.\nOther types of biopsy\nIf you're not able to have one of the biopsies described above, or you've had one and the results weren't clear, you may be offered a different type of biopsy. This may be a type of surgical biopsy such as a thoracoscopy or a mediastinoscopy, or a biopsy carried out using a needle inserted through your skin.\nA percutaneous needle biopsy involves removing a sample from a suspected tumour to test it at a laboratory for cancerous cells.\nThe doctor carrying out the biopsy will use a CT scanner to guide a needle to the site of a suspected tumour through the skin. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the surrounding skin, and the needle is passed through your skin and into your lungs. The needle will then be used to remove a sample of tissue for testing.\nA thoracoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to examine a particular area of your chest and take tissue and fluid samples.\nYou're likely to need a\u00a0general anaesthetic before having a thoracoscopy. Two or three small cuts will be made in your chest to pass a tube (similar to a bronchoscope) into your chest. The doctor will use the tube to look inside your chest and take samples. The samples will then be sent away for tests.\nAfter a thoracoscopy, you may need to stay in hospital overnight while any further fluid in your lungs is drained out.\nA mediastinoscopy allows the doctor to examine the area between your lungs at the centre of your chest (mediastinum).\nFor this test, you'll need to have a general anaesthetic and stay in hospital for a couple of days. The doctor will make a small cut at the bottom of your neck so they can pass a thin tube into your chest.\nThe tube has a camera at the end, which enables the doctor to see inside your chest. They'll also be able to take samples of your cells and lymph nodes at the same time. The lymph nodes are tested because they're usually the first place that lung cancer spreads to.\nStaging\nOnce tests have been completed, it should be possible to work out what stage your cancer is, what this means\u00a0for your treatment and whether it's possible to\u00a0completely cure the cancer.\nNon-small-cell lung cancer (the most common type)\u00a0usually spreads more slowly than small-cell lung cancer and responds differently to treatment.\nThe cancer is contained within the lung and hasn't spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage 1 can also be divided into two sub-stages:\n\nstage 1A \u2013 the tumour is less than 3cm in size (1.2 inches)\u00a0\nstage 1B \u2013 the tumour is 3-5cm (1.2-2 inches)\n\nStage 2 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 2A and 2B.\nIn stage 2A lung cancer, either:\n\nthe tumour is 5\u00a0to 7cm\u00a0\nthe tumour is less than 5cm\u00a0and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes\n\nIn stage 2B lung cancer, either:\n\nthe tumour is larger than 7cm\u00a0\nthe tumour is 5\u00a0to 7cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes\u00a0\nthe cancer hasn't spread to lymph nodes, but has spread to surrounding\u00a0muscles or tissue\u00a0\nthe cancer has spread to one of the main airways (bronchus)\u00a0\nthe cancer has caused the lung to collapse\u00a0\nthere are multiple small tumours in the lung\n\nStage 3 is divided into 2 sub-stages: 3A and 3B.\nIn stage 3A lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or into the surrounding tissue. This can be:\n\nthe covering of the lung (the pleura)\nthe chest wall\nthe middle of the chest\nother lymph nodes near the affected lung\n\nIn stage 3B lung cancer, the cancer has spread to either of the following:\n\nlymph nodes on either side of the chest, above the collarbones\nanother important part of the body, such as the gullet (oesophagus), windpipe (trachea), heart or into a main blood vessel\n\nIn stage 4 lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to both lungs or to another part of the body (such as the bones, liver or brain), or the cancer has caused fluid-containing cancer cells to build up around your heart or lungs.\nSmall-cell lung cancer is less common than non-small-cell lung cancer. The cancerous cells responsible for the condition are smaller in size when examined under a microscope than the cells that cause non-small-cell lung cancer.\nSmall-cell lung cancer only\u00a0has 2 possible stages:\n\nlimited disease \u2013 the cancer has not spread beyond the lung\nextensive disease \u2013 the cancer has spread beyond the lung\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Types of lung cancer\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Being diagnosed with lung cancer\u00a0\n\n\n\nTreatment for lung cancer is carried out by a team of specialists who will work together to provide the best possible treatment.\nThis team contains all the specialists required to make a proper diagnosis, to stage your cancer and to plan the best treatment. If you want to know more, ask your specialist about this.\nThe type of treatment you'll receive for lung cancer depends on several factors, including:\n\nthe type of lung cancer you have (non-small-cell or small-cell cancer)\nthe size and position of the cancer\nhow far advanced your cancer is (the stage)\nyour overall health\n\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.\nThe main treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, you may receive a combination of these treatments.\nYour treatment plan\nYour treatment plan depends on whether you have non-small-cell lung cancer or small-cell lung cancer.\nIf you have non-small-cell lung cancer that's confined to one lung and you're in good general health, you'll probably have surgery to remove the cancerous cells. This may be followed by a course of chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells that may have remained in the body.\nIf the cancer hasn't spread too far but surgery isn't possible (for example, if your general health means you have an increased risk of developing complications), radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells will usually be recommended. In some cases, this may be combined with chemotherapy (known as chemoradiotherapy).\nIf the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually recommended. If the cancer starts to grow again after initial chemotherapy treatment, another course of treatment may be recommended.\nIn some cases, a treatment called biological or targeted therapy may be recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy, or after chemotherapy. Biological therapies are medications that can control or stop the growth of cancer cells.\u00a0\nSmall-cell lung cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy, either on its own or in combination with radiotherapy. This can help to prolong life and relieve symptoms.\nSurgery isn't usually used to treat this type of lung cancer. This is\u00a0because the cancer has often already spread to other areas of the body by the time it's diagnosed. However, if the cancer is found very early, surgery may be used. In these cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\nSurgery\nThere are\u00a03\u00a0 types of lung cancer surgery:\n\nlobectomy \u2013\u00a0where\u00a0one\u00a0or more large parts of the lung (called lobes) are removed \u2013 your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in 1 section of 1 lung\npneumonectomy \u2013 where the entire lung is removed \u2013 this is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung\nwedge resection or segmentectomy \u2013 where a small piece of the lung is removed (this procedure is\u00a0only suitable for a small number of patients, as it is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung \u2013 this is\u00a0usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer)\n\nPeople are naturally concerned that they won't\u00a0be able to breathe if some or all of a lung is removed, but it's possible to breathe normally with 1 lung. However, if you have breathing problems before the operation, such as breathlessness, it's likely that these symptoms will continue after surgery.\nBefore surgery can take place, you'll need to have a number of tests to check your general state of health and your lung function. These may include:\n\nan\u00a0electrocardiogram (ECG) \u2013 electrodes are used to monitor the electrical activity of your heart\nspirometry\u00a0\u2013 you'll breathe into a machine called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can breathe in and out\n\nSurgery is usually performed by making a cut (incision)\u00a0in your chest or side, and removing a section or all of the affected lung. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed if it's thought that the cancer may have spread to them.\nIn some cases, an alternative to this approach, called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), may be suitable. VATS is a type of keyhole surgery, where small incisions are made in the chest. A small fibre-optic camera is inserted into one of the incisions, so the surgeon can see images of the inside of your chest\u00a0on a monitor.\nYou'll probably be\u00a0able to go home 5 to 10 days after your operation. However, it can take many weeks to recover fully from a lung operation.\nAfter your operation, you'll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. Even if you have to stay in bed, you'll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots from forming. A physiotherapist will show you breathing exercises to help prevent complications.\nWhen you go home, you'll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Walking and swimming are good forms of exercise that are suitable for most people after treatment for lung cancer. Talk to your care team about which types of exercise are suitable for you.\nAs with all surgery, lung surgery carries a risk of complications. These are estimated to occur in 1 out in 5 cases. These complications can usually be treated using medication or additional surgery, which may mean you need to stay in hospital for longer.\nComplications of lung surgery can include:\n\ninflammation or infection of the lung (pneumonia)\u00a0\nexcessive bleeding\u00a0\na blood clot in the leg (deep vein thrombosis), which could potentially travel up to the lung (pulmonary embolism)\n\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses pulses of radiation to destroy cancer cells. There are a number of ways it can be used to treat people with lung cancer.\nAn intensive course of radiotherapy, known as radical radiotherapy, can be used to try to cure non-small-cell lung cancer if the person isn't healthy enough for surgery. For very small tumours, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery.\nRadiotherapy can also be used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn't possible (this is known as palliative radiotherapy).\nA type of radiotherapy known as prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is also sometimes used during the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. PCI involves treating the whole brain with a low dose of radiation. It's used as a preventative measure because there's a risk that small-cell lung cancer will spread to your brain.\nThe 3 main\u00a0ways that radiotherapy can be given are described below:\n\nconventional external beam radiotherapy \u2013 a machine is used to direct beams of radiation at affected parts of your body\nstereotactic radiotherapy \u2013 a more accurate type of external beam radiotherapy where several high-energy beams are used to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumour, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue as much as possible\ninternal radiotherapy \u2013 a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into your lung \u2013 a\u00a0small piece of radioactive material is placed inside the catheter and positioned against the site of the tumour before being removed after a few minutes\n\nFor lung cancer, external beam radiotherapy is used more often than internal radiotherapy, particularly if it's thought that a cure is possible. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to treat tumours that are very small, as it's more effective than standard radiotherapy alone in these circumstances.\nInternal radiotherapy only tends to be used as a palliative treatment when the cancer is blocking or partly blocking your airway.\nA course of radiotherapy treatment can be planned in several different ways.\nRadical radiotherapy is usually given 5 days a week, with a break at weekends. Each session of radiotherapy lasts 10\u00a0to 15 minutes and the course usually lasts 4 to 7 weeks.\nContinuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) is an alternative method of delivering radical radiotherapy. CHART is given 3 times a day for 12 days in a row.\nFor stereotactic radiotherapy, fewer treatment sessions are needed because a higher dose of radiation is delivered with each treatment. People having conventional radical radiotherapy are likely to have around 20\u00a0to 32 treatment sessions, whereas stereotactic radiotherapy typically only requires anything from 3 to 10 sessions.\nPalliative radiotherapy usually only requires 1 to 5 sessions to control your symptoms.\u00a0\nSide effects of radiotherapy to the chest\u00a0include:\n\nchest pain\u00a0\nfatigue\u00a0\npersistent\u00a0cough that may bring up blood-stained phlegm (this is normal and nothing to worry about)\u00a0\ndifficulties swallowing (dysphagia)\u00a0\nredness and soreness of the skin, which looks and feels like sunburn\u00a0\nhair loss\u00a0on your chest\u00a0\n\nSide effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has been completed.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medication to treat cancer. There are several different ways that chemotherapy can be used to treat lung cancer. For example, it can be:\n\ngiven before surgery to shrink a tumour, which can increase the chance of successful surgery\u00a0(this is usually only done as part of a clinical trial)\ngiven after surgery to prevent the cancer returning\u00a0\nused to relieve symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn't possible\ncombined with radiotherapy\n\nChemotherapy treatments are usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to let your body recover from the effects of the treatment.\nThe number of cycles of chemotherapy you need will depend on the type and the grade of your lung cancer. Most people require four to 6 courses of treatment over 3 to 6 months.\nChemotherapy for lung cancer involves taking a combination of different medications. The medications are usually delivered through a drip into a vein (intravenously), or into a tube connected to one of the blood vessels in your chest. Some people may be given capsules or tablets to swallow instead.\nSide effects of chemotherapy can include:\n\nfatigue\u00a0\nnausea\nvomiting\u00a0\nmouth ulcers\nhair loss\n\nThese side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished, or you may be able to take other medicines to make you feel better during your chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.\u00a0Tell your care team or GP as soon as possible if you have possible signs of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more, or you suddenly feel generally unwell.\nOther treatments\nAs well as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there are a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to treat lung cancer.\u00a0\nBiological therapies\u00a0are newer medications. They're sometimes recommended as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy for non-small-cell cancer that has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective.\nExamples of biological therapies include\u00a0erlotinib and gefitinib. These are also called\u00a0growth factor inhibitors because they work by disrupting the growth of the cancer cells.\nBiological therapies are only suitable for people who have\u00a0certain proteins\u00a0in their cancerous cells. Your doctor may be able to request tests on\u00a0a small\u00a0sample of cells removed from your lung (biopsy) to determine whether these treatments\u00a0are likely to be suitable for you.\nRadiofrequency ablation is a new type of treatment that can treat non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed at an early stage.\nThe doctor carrying out the treatment uses a computerised tomography (CT) scanner to guide a needle to the site of the tumour. The needle will be pressed into the tumour and radio waves will be sent through the needle. These waves generate heat, which kills the cancer cells.\nThe most common complication of radiofrequency ablation is that a pocket of air gets trapped between the inner and outer layer of your lungs (pneumothorax). This can be treated by placing a tube into the lungs to drain away the trapped air.\nCryotherapy is a treatment that can be used if the cancer starts to block your airways. This is known as endobronchial obstruction, and it can cause symptoms such as:\n\nbreathing problems\na cough\ncoughing up blood\n\nCryotherapy is performed in a similar way to internal radiotherapy, except that instead of using a radioactive source, a device known as a cryoprobe is placed against the tumour. The cryoprobe can generate very cold temperatures, which help to shrink the tumour.\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT)\u00a0is a treatment that can be used to treat early-stage lung cancer when a person is unable or unwilling to have surgery. It can also be used to remove a tumour that's blocking the airways.\nPhotodynamic therapy is carried out in 2 stages. Firstly, you'll be given an injection of a medication that makes the cells in your body very sensitive to light.\nThe next stage is carried out 24\u00a0to 72 hours later. A thin tube\u00a0will be guided to the site of the tumour, and a laser will be beamed through it. The cancerous cells, which are now more sensitive to light, will be destroyed by the laser beam.\nSide effects of photodynamic therapy can include inflammation of the airways\u00a0and a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Both these side effects can cause symptoms of breathlessness and lung and throat pain. However, these symptoms should gradually pass as your lungs recover from the effects of the treatment.\n\n\nBreathlessness is common in people who have lung cancer, whether it is a symptom of the condition or a side effect of treatment.\nIn\u00a0many cases, breathlessness can be\u00a0improved with some simple measures such as:\n\nbreathing in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth (after treatment for lung cancer, you may see a physiotherapist, who can teach you some simple breathing exercises)\nmaking daily activities easier \u2013 for example, using a trolley when you go shopping or keeping things you often need downstairs so you don't need to regularly walk up and down the stairs\nusing a fan to direct cool air towards your face\neating smaller and more frequent meals, and taking smaller mouthfuls\n\nIf\u00a0measures like these aren't enough to control your breathlessness, you may need further treatment.\u00a0There are a number of medications that can help improve breathlessness. Home oxygen treatment\u00a0may be an option in more severe cases.\nIf your breathlessness is caused by another condition, such as a chest infection or\u00a0a fluid build-up around the lungs (a pleural effusion), treating this\u00a0underlying\u00a0cause\u00a0may\u00a0help your breathing.\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Managing breathlessness\u00a0\nCancer Research UK: Coping with breathlessness\nThe Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation: Managing symptoms\u00a0\n\nPain\nSome people with lung cancer have pain, while others never have any. About 1 in 3 people who are treated for\u00a0cancer experience some pain.\nPain isn't related to the severity of the cancer \u2013 it varies from person to person. What causes cancer pain isn\u2019t thoroughly understood, but there are ways of treating it so the pain can be controlled.\nPeople\u00a0with advanced lung cancer may need treatment for pain as their cancer progresses. This can be part of palliative care and is often provided by doctors, nurses and other members of the palliative care team. You can have palliative care at home, in hospital, in a hospice or other care centre.\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Controlling cancer pain\u00a0\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Your pain management team\n\nEmotional effects and relationships\nHaving cancer can lead to a range of emotions. These may include shock, anxiety, relief, sadness and depression.\nPeople deal with serious problems in different ways. It's hard to predict how living with cancer will affect you.\nBeing open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help you may put others at ease. But don't feel shy about telling people that you need some time to yourself, if that's what you need.\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan: emotional effects\n\nTalk to others\nYour GP or specialist nurse may be able to reassure you if you have questions, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist phone helpline. Your GP practice will have information on these.\nYou may find it helpful to talk about your experience of lung cancer with others in a similar position at a local support group. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet other people\u00a0who have been diagnosed with lung cancer and had treatment.\nIf you have feelings of depression, talk to your GP \u2013 they can provide advice and support.\nRead further information:\n\nThe Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation: Lung cancer support groups\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Depression\u00a0\n\nMoney and financial support\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support.\nIf you have a job but can't work because of your illness, you are entitled to\u00a0Statutory Sick Pay from your employer.\nIf you don't have a job and can't work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance.\nIf you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer\u2019s Allowance.\nYou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or you have a low household income.\nIt's a good idea to find out early on what help is available to you. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who\u00a0can\u00a0give you the information you need.\nRead further information:\n\nGOV.UK: Carers and disability benefits.\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Financial issues\u00a0\n\nPalliative care\nIf you have a lot of symptoms caused by lung cancer, your GP and healthcare team will need to give you support and pain relief. This is called palliative care. Support is also available for your family and friends.\nAs your cancer progresses, your doctor should work with you to establish a clear management plan based on your (and your carer's) wishes. This includes whether you'd prefer to go to hospital, a hospice, or be looked after at home as you become progressively more ill.\nIt will take account of what services are available to you locally, what's clinically advisable and your personal circumstances.\nMore about palliative care\nRead further information:\n\nNICE: Supportive and palliative care for adults with cancer\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Caring for someone with cancer\nMarie Curie Cancer Care: Support for patients\n\n\n\nIf you smoke, the best way to prevent lung cancer and other serious conditions is to stop smoking as soon as possible.\nHowever long you have been smoking, it's always worth quitting. Every year you don't smoke decreases your risk of getting serious illnesses, such as lung cancer. After 10 years of not smoking, your chances of developing lung cancer falls to half that of someone who smokes.\u00a0Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0can offer advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking.\u00a0\nYour GP or pharmacist can also give you help and advice about giving up smoking.\nDiet\nResearch suggests that eating a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including at least 5 portions a day of fresh fruit and vegetables and plenty of\u00a0whole grains, can reduce\u00a0your risk of lung cancer, as well as other types of cancer and heart disease.\nMore about eating well\nExercise\nThere's\u00a0strong evidence to suggest that regular exercise can lower the risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer.\nAdults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week.\nMore about\u00a0keeping active\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening.\nTypes of lupus\nThere are some types of lupus that just affect the skin \u2013 such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects.\nHowever, the term \"lupus\" is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs.\nSymptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe.\nEven mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person\u2019s quality of life.\nThe rest of this article will focus on SLE.\nSigns and symptoms\nSLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are:\n\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nrashes \u2013 particularly on the face, wrists and hands\njoint pain\u00a0and swelling\n\nAs the\u00a0symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose.\nIf you\u00a0have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE, you should see your GP so they can try to determine the cause.\nRead more about the symptoms of lupus\u00a0and diagnosing lupus.\u00a0\nWhat causes lupus?\nSLE\u00a0is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs.\nAs with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors\u00a0may be\u00a0responsible for triggering\u00a0SLE in certain people.\nRead more\u00a0about the causes of lupus.\nWho is affected\nSLE is an uncommon condition where around 90% of cases occur in women. The condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages.\nThe condition tends to be less common in people of white European origin and more common in those of African, Caribbean or Asian origin.\nHow\u00a0lupus is treated\nThere is currently no cure for SLE, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and reduce the chances of organ damage.\nThese medications include:\n\nhydroxychloroquine \u2013 a medicine that has historically been used to treat\u00a0malaria, but can also help treat some symptoms of SLE\ncorticosteroids \u2013 anti-inflammatory medications\nimmunosuppressants \u2013 a group of medicines that suppress your immune system\n\nWith good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with SLE are able to manage their condition effectively.\nRead more\u00a0about treating lupus.\nOutlook\nA few decades ago SLE was regarded as a terminal condition, as many people would die of an associated complication within a few years of being diagnosed.\nAs a result of early diagnosis and advances in treatment, however, the outlook for SLE is now much better. The vast majority of people diagnosed with the condition will have a normal or near-normal life expectancy.\nHowever, some people with SLE are still at risk of life-threatening complications as a result of damage to internal organs and tissues, such as heart attack\u00a0or\u00a0stroke. SLE, and some of the treatments for it, can also increase your risk of developing potentially serious infections.\nRead more about the complications of lupus.\n\n\nSymptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can vary widely from person to person. Some people may only experience a few mild symptoms, whereas others may be more severely affected.\nEven if you usually have mild symptoms, SLE can \"flare-up\", with symptoms becoming more severe or new symptoms developing.\nMain\u00a0symptoms\nThe 3\u00a0main symptoms of SLE are fatigue, joint pain and\u00a0rashes.\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms of SLE. You may feel very tired even though you\u00a0get plenty of sleep. Carrying out everyday tasks, such as housework or office work, can leave you feeling exhausted.\nMany people with SLE find that fatigue is the most distressing and disruptive aspect of SLE because it has a negative impact on\u00a0their work and social life.\nIf you have SLE, you are likely to experience joint pain in your hands and feet. You may find the pain changes from one set of joints to another quite quickly, and is usually worse in the morning.\nUnlike some other conditions that affect the joints, SLE is unlikely to cause your joints to become permanently damaged or deformed.\nMany people with SLE develop rashes on their skin \u2013 most commonly on the face, wrists and hands. A rash over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose is particularly common and is known as a \"butterfly rash\" or \"malar rash\".\nRashes caused by SLE may\u00a0get better\u00a0after a few days or weeks, but can last longer or even be permanent.\nRashes caused by SLE can sometimes be itchy or painful, and they may get worse if they are exposed to sunlight. This is known as \"photosensitivity\".\nOther symptoms\nSLE can also cause a wide range of symptoms.\u00a0However, you're unlikely\u00a0to have all of the symptoms listed below, and many people with the condition will only experience\u00a0the main symptoms.\nOther\u00a0features of SLE may include:\n\na fever (high temperature)\nswollen lymph glands\u00a0(small glands found throughout your body, including in your neck, armpits and groin)\nrecurring\u00a0mouth ulcers\nhair loss\u00a0(alopecia)\nhigh blood pressure\u00a0(hypertension)\nheadaches\u00a0and migraines\nstomach (abdominal) pain\nchest pain\ndepression\u00a0\ndry eyes\nmemory loss\nseizures (fits)\nproblems thinking clearly and difficulty telling the difference between reality and imagination (psychosis)\nshortness of breath\nRaynaud's phenomenon a condition that limits the blood supply to your hands and feet\u00a0when it is cold\nankle swelling and fluid retention (oedema)\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE.\nWhile it is likely that your symptoms are being caused by a more common condition, it is important to see a doctor for a diagnosis.\nRead more about diagnosing lupus.\n\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system.\nThe immune system is the body\u2019s natural defence against illness and infection. When the immune system detects the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria or a virus, it sends white blood cells and antibodies to attack it.\nIn cases of SLE, antibodies released by the immune system can attack healthy tissue, cells and organs.\nIt's not clear exactly why this happens, although most experts think SLE has more than one cause. It has been suggested that there may be a number of genetic factors that make people more susceptible to the condition, and that it also takes one or more environmental factors to trigger SLE in those who are susceptible.\nPossible genetic and environmental factors are discussed in more detail below.\nGenetic factors\nBrothers and sisters of people with SLE are much more likely to develop the condition than the population at large.\nResearchers have identified a number of different genetic mutations that seem to make people more susceptible to developing SLE. A genetic mutation occurs when normal instructions carried in certain genes become \"scrambled\", resulting in the body\u2019s processes not working normally.\nMost faulty genes are associated with regulating certain functions of the immune system, which may explain why the immune system in people with SLE starts to malfunction.\nEnvironmental factors\nA number of environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in vulnerable individuals, although the evidence for many of these is limited.\nPossible environmental factors that have been suggested include:\n\nexposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light)\nhormonal changes that occur during a woman\u2019s lifetime, such as during\u00a0puberty or pregnancy\ncertain infections, such as by the\u00a0Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \u2013 a common viral infection that doesn't usually cause any symptoms\nsmoking\n\n\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be difficult to diagnose, as it has similar symptoms to several other, far more common, conditions.\nDiagnosis may also be difficult\u00a0because\u00a0symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and they may change over time. For example, there may be periods where your symptoms are not very noticeable, or times when they flare up and become more severe.\nFor a confident diagnosis of SLE to be made, you will need to have several symptoms of lupus and a number of\u00a0blood tests may need to be carried out.\nBlood tests\nSome of the blood tests that may be carried out are described below.\nA blood test called the\u00a0erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test can be used to\u00a0determine whether there is any inflammation in your body.\nThis can be useful in diagnosing SLE because the condition can cause\u00a0many areas of the body to become inflamed (swell), including\u00a0the joints and internal organs.\nThe test works by measuring how long it takes for red blood cells to fall to the bottom of\u00a0a test tube. The quicker they fall, the more likely it is that there are high levels of inflammation.\nAn anti-nuclear antibody test checks\u00a0whether there is a certain type of antibody cell in your blood, known as the anti-nuclear antibody. Approximately 95% of people with SLE have this antibody.\nHowever, it is possible to have the anti-nuclear antibody without having SLE, so the anti-nuclear antibody test is not a definitive way of testing for the condition.\u00a0Other blood tests will also be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nAn anti-DNA test also checks for a certain type of antibody in your blood, known as the anti-DNA antibody. If you have the anti-DNA antibody, it is highly likely that you have SLE. However, the antibody is only found in around 70% of people with the condition.\nThe level of anti-DNA antibodies increases when SLE is more active, so during a flare-up of symptoms your reading from this test may be greater than normal.\nComplement is a chemical in the blood that forms part of your immune system.\u00a0The level of this chemical may be tested to check how active your SLE is. The level of complement in your blood decreases when SLE is more active.\nOther tests\nOnce you have been diagnosed with SLE, you will normally need regular\u00a0monitoring to see\u00a0how the condition is affecting your body.\nIf you have SLE it is possible you may\u00a0develop other conditions, such as kidney problems. Monitoring your condition will allow your doctor to check for these complications and, if necessary, treat them as soon as possible.\nYou may need to have scans, such as an X-ray, ultrasound scan,\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0or a computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0to check whether SLE is affecting your internal organs.\nRead more about the complications of lupus.\n\n\nThere is currently no cure for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but treatments that can ease the symptoms and make it easier to live with are available.\nIn most cases, treatment will involve a combination of self-care measures and medication.\nProtecting yourself from the sun\nExposure to sunlight can sometimes make symptoms such as rashes worse, and it's\u00a0important to protect your skin when\u00a0in the sun.\nThis means wearing clothing that covers your skin, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. You will also need to apply sunscreen with a high SPF to prevent sunburn. However, some people with lupus\u00a0are not sun-sensitive and do not need to take extra precautions.\nAs people get most of their\u00a0vitamin D\u00a0as a result of\u00a0direct sunlight on\u00a0the skin, there is a risk you\u00a0may not get enough of this vitamin if you need to avoid sun exposure.\u00a0This means you may need to make an extra effort to include good sources of vitamin D in your diet to avoid problems such as osteoporosis (weakened bones), and you may be advised to take vitamin D supplements.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a common painkilling medication that reduces inflammation in the body. If you experience joint or muscle pain as a result of SLE, you may be prescribed a NSAID to help ease your symptoms.\nCommonly prescribed NSAIDs for SLE include ibuprofen, naproxen\u00a0and diclofenac.\nYou can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, over the counter. These NSAIDs may be suitable if your joint or muscle pain is mild. For more severe pain, you will need stronger medication prescribed by your GP.\nNSAIDs may not be suitable for people who have stomach, kidney or liver problems, or have had these problems in the past. They may also be unsuitable for people with asthma. Your GP will advise\u00a0about which NSAID is right\u00a0for you.\nIf taken in high doses or over long periods of time, NSAIDs can damage your stomach lining, which may cause internal bleeding.\nIf you need to take NSAIDs on a long-term basis, your GP will carefully monitor you to check for any problems, and you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect your stomach.\nHydroxychloroquine\nHydroxychloroquine\u00a0is a medicine\u00a0that has been\u00a0used to treat malaria, but\u00a0is also effective in treating some of the symptoms of SLE, such as rashes, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue.\nYou will usually have to take hydroxychloroquine for 6 to 12 weeks before you\u00a0notice any benefit.\nMost expert doctors recommend\u00a0people with SLE take hydroxychloroquine on a long-term basis as a way of controlling their symptoms, helping to prevent flare-ups and to prevent development of more serious problems from lupus.\nSide effects of hydroxychloroquine are uncommon, but may include indigestion, diarrhoea,\u00a0headaches and\u00a0rashes.\nHydroxychloroquine may also cause more serious side effects in a small number of people. For example, in rare cases, this medicine can cause\u00a0eye damage. Contact your GP or specialist immediately if you experience vision problems while taking hydroxychloroquine.\nIf your GP or specialist feels it is necessary, you may need regular eye examinations.\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids\u00a0are\u00a0a type of medicine that help reduce inflammation quickly. They can be very effective in treating symptoms of SLE, but are usually only prescribed if the condition is severe.\nIf you have severe symptoms of SLE, or if you are experiencing a flare-up, you may be given a large dose of corticosteroids to help bring your symptoms under control. As your symptoms ease, your dosage can gradually be reduced.\nWhen prescribing corticosteroids, the lowest effective dosage is always given. This is because high doses or long-term use of corticosteroids can cause side effects. These may include:\n\nthinning of your bones\nthinning of your skin\nweight gain\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\n\nCorticosteroids are a safe and effective form of treatment, provided\u00a0they are taken correctly and under the supervision of your GP or specialist. They will tailor the steroid dose to your disease activity, to minimise side effects while effectively controlling the condition.\nImmunosuppressants\nImmunosuppressants are a type of medicine that suppress your immune system. They can help improve your symptoms of SLE by limiting the damage\u00a0your immune system causes when it attacks healthy parts of your body.\nCommonly prescribed immunosuppressant medicines include azathioprine,\u00a0methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil\u00a0and cyclophosphamide.\nImmunosuppressants are sometimes used in conjunction with corticosteroids (see above) because these medicines may ease your symptoms more effectively when used together. Alternatively, the use of immunosuppressant medication may allow your corticosteroid dose to be reduced.\nImmunosuppressant medication is usually only prescribed if you have severe SLE. This is because this type of medication is powerful and can cause side effects such as:\n\nloss of appetite\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\nswollen gums\nbruising or bleeding more easily\nheadache\nacne\nextra hair growth\nweight gain\nliver damage\nan increased risk of infection (see below)\n\nMethotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide can also cause birth defects if they are taken during pregnancy, so you should use a reliable form of contraception if you are taking these medications and are sexually active. If you are trying to become pregnant, an alternative medication such as azathioprine can be used.\nTell your GP if a side effect becomes particularly troublesome, as\u00a0it may mean your dose needs to be adjusted.\nTaking immunosuppressant medication can increase your risk of developing an infection. This is a particularly serious\u00a0concern for people with SLE, because the organ damage that can occur as a result\u00a0of the condition means infections are more likely to be life-threatening.\nIt is therefore\u00a0very important to report any\u00a0symptoms of a possible infection to your GP immediately.\nSymptoms of infection may sometimes be similar to a flare up of\u00a0SLE and include:\n\na fever (high temperature)\na\u00a0cough or\u00a0breathlessness\nburning when passing urine or\u00a0passing blood in\u00a0your urine\ndiarrhoea\n\nYou should also try to avoid contact with anyone known to have an infection \u2013 even if it is an infection you were previously immune to, such as\u00a0chickenpox or measles.\u00a0This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered).\nRituximab\nRituximab\u00a0is a new type of medication\u00a0used in people with severe SLE\u00a0that\u00a0doesn't respond to other treatments.\nRituximab was originally designed to treat certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma, but it has since proved effective in treating a number of autoimmune conditions, such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis.\nRituximab works by locking on to and killing cells called \"B-cells\", which produce antibodies responsible for the symptoms of SLE. It is administered directly into your vein over the course of several hours, known as an infusion.\nRituximab is not currently licensed for treating SLE in the UK, but your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using rituximab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe\u00a0it is in treating SLE.\nCommon side effects of rituximab include:\n\nflu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature\ndizziness\nvomiting\n\nIn rare cases, rituximab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.\nBelimumab\nBelimumab is a new medication given to people with active SLE who don\u2019t respond to other treatments.\nIt\u00a0works by binding to growth factors that are needed for the survival of B-cells. It is given directly into your vein over several hours, known as an infusion. The first 3\u00a0doses are given 14 days apart, and\u00a0the medication is usually given once a month thereafter.\nBelimumab is licensed for treating SLE in the UK, and there may be instances where your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using belimumab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe it is in treating SLE.\nCommon side effects of belimumab include:\n\nflu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature\nnausea and diarrhoea\nheadache\ndifficulty sleeping (insomnia)\na cough,\u00a0sore throat and blocked or runny nose\njoint pain\nincreased risk of infections\nchanges in blood pressure\n\nIn rare cases, belimumab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.\n\n\nIf your symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are mild or well-controlled, you may find it barely affects your day-to-day life and that you do not have any complications.\nHowever, for some people, SLE can be a more serious condition\u00a0that can cause life-threatening complications. Some of\u00a0these\u00a0complications are outlined below.\nKidney problems\nAround 1\u00a0in every 3\u00a0people with SLE\u00a0will develop a potentially serious kidney disease called lupus nephritis, which is caused by prolonged inflammation of the kidneys.\nLupus nephritis tends to develop relatively early in the course of SLE, usually within five years of diagnosis.\nSymptoms of lupus nephritis can include:\n\nswelling of your feet (oedema)\nheadaches\ndizziness\nblood in your urine\na frequent need to urinate\n\nLupus nephritis can also cause high blood pressure (hypertension). If left untreated, it can put you at risk of developing life-threatening problems such as a\u00a0heart attack or\u00a0stroke.\nIn many cases, lupus nephritis does not cause any noticeable symptoms. However, this does not mean the condition is not dangerous, as the kidneys could still be being damaged.\nIf you have SLE, it is likely you will need to have regular blood tests\u00a0so the condition of your kidneys can be carefully monitored. If you develop lupus nephritis, it can usually be successfully controlled using immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide.\nIn a small number of cases, the kidney damage can become severe enough to require treatment with\u00a0dialysis (where a machine is used to\u00a0replicates many of the kidneys' functions) or a kidney transplant.\nCardiovascular disease\nCardiovascular disease (CVD)\u00a0is a general term for any type of health condition that affects the heart and arteries. It is often associated with\u00a0blood clots and\u00a0atherosclerosis\u00a0(hardening and narrowing of the arteries).\nExamples of CVD include coronary heart disease, angina\u00a0(chest pain caused by the heart\u00a0not receiving enough blood), heart attack and stroke.\nPeople with SLE are more likely to develop CVD\u00a0than the general population, because SLE can cause your heart and arteries to become inflamed and damaged.\nIf you have SLE, you can reduce your risk of CVD by making health lifestyle chances, such as:\n\nstopping smoking\u00a0if you smoke\neating a healthy, balanced diet low in saturated fat, sugar and salt, and containing at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day\nmaintaining a healthy weight\nexercising regularly \u2013 at least\u00a0150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) a week of exercise strenuous enough to leave you slightly out of breath is recommended\ncutting down on your alcohol consumption\n\nPregnancy complications\nSLE does not usually affect fertility, but it can increase your risk of experiencing pregnancy complications, such as:\n\npre-eclampsia\u00a0(a condition that causes high blood pressure during pregnancy)\npremature delivery\nmiscarriage\nstillbirth\n\nSome children of women with SLE can also be born with\u00a0heart block (where electrical pulses that control the beating of the heart are disrupted) and rashes. This is known as \"neonatal lupus syndrome\".\nIf you have SLE and are thinking of having a baby, it is best to plan this carefully with your doctors if possible. The risk of complications is higher if you become pregnant during periods where your symptoms are particularly severe, so you will usually be advised to try to avoid getting pregnant until your symptoms are better controlled.\nIf you do become pregnant, you will need to be monitored closely by your specialist and\u00a0by an obstetrician, so they can check for any problems.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Lymphoedema is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues. It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs.\nOther symptoms of lymphoedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them.\nLymphoedema can get worse if it's not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition.\nRead more about the symptoms of lymphoedema\u00a0and diagnosing lymphoedema\nWhat causes\u00a0lymphoedema?\nLymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. This is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. Its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues.\nAbnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphoedema.\nThere are two main types of lymphoedema:\n\nprimary lymphoedema \u2013 caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood\nsecondary lymphoedema \u2013 caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury, cancer treatment, inflammation of the limb or a lack of limb movement\u00a0\n\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of lymphoedema\nWho is affected\nA recent study has suggested that over 200,000 people in the UK may be living with lymphoedema.\u00a0\nSecondary lymphoedema has been shown to affect approximately one in five women after breast cancer treatment.\nPrimary lymphoedema is less common than secondary lymphoedema, and is estimated to affect around one in every 6,000 people.\nHow lymphoedema is treated\nThere is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system.\nThese include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques.\nRead more about\u00a0treating lymphoedema and preventing lymphoedema\nComplications\nThe build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection.\nIn particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called\u00a0cellulitis is commonly reported in people with the condition.\nRead more about the\u00a0complications of lymphoedema\n\n\nThe main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight.\nAt first, the swelling may come and go. It may get worse during the day and then go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent.\nOther symptoms in an affected body part can include:\n\nan aching, heavy feeling\ndifficulty with movement\nrepeated skin infections\nthe skin becoming hard and tight\nfolds developing in the skin\nwart-like growths developing on the skin\na leakage of fluid through the skin\n\nWhen these symptoms start depends on what is causing the condition.\nIf lymphoedema is caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body), the symptoms can develop at any age, but most commonly start during infancy, adolescence or early adulthood.\nIn these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time \u2013 particularly the lower leg.\nIf lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. For example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment for\u00a0breast cancer, lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years.\nRead more about the causes of lymphoedema\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you are at risk of developing lymphoedema because you have had treatment for\u00a0cancer, you may be offered an assessment for the condition as part of your treatment aftercare plan. Speak to your consultant or specialist nurse if you have any concerns.\nIf you think you may have lymphoedema, but not as a result of treatment for cancer, see your GP.\nRead more about diagnosing lymphoedema\n\n\nThere are two types of lymphoedema, called primary and secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes.\nThe main causes of primary and secondary lymphoedema are outlined below.\nPrimary lymphoedema\nPrimary lymphoedema is caused by alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that help fight infection and remove excess fluid from the body).\nThese \"faulty\" genes result in the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining fluid not developing properly or not working as they should.\nPrimary lymphoedema usually runs in families, but not every child born to someone with the condition will develop it themselves.\u00a0\nSecondary lymphoedema\nSecondary lymphoedema develops in people who previously had a normal lymphatic system.\nIt can have a number of different causes. Some of the most common causes are explained below.\nCancer cells can spread around the body through the lymphatic system, so part of the treatment for the condition can involve surgically removing sections of the lymphatic system potentially containing cancerous cells.\nAlthough the surgeon will try to ensure limited damage to your lymphatic system, this isn't always possible.\nThere is a particular risk of lymphoedema occurring as a complication of treatment for:\n\nbreast cancer\nmelanoma skin cancer\ngynaecological cancers \u2013 such as cervical cancer\u00a0and vulval cancer\ngenitourinary cancers \u2013 such\u00a0as prostate cancer or penile cancer\n\nRadiotherapy\u00a0uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous tissue, but it can also damage healthy tissue.\nIf it's necessary to use radiotherapy to destroy cancerous cells in your lymphatic system, there is a risk that the system could become permanently damaged and unable to drain fluid properly.\nIn some cases, an infection can cause lymphoedema.\nCellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that can cause lymphoedema. Severe cellulitis can damage the tissue around the lymphatic system, causing it to become scarred.\nAnother infectious cause of lymphoedema is a parasitic infection called filariasis. This is a common cause of lymphoedema worldwide, but is not a risk in the UK.\nConditions that cause tissue to become inflamed (red and swollen) can also permanently damage the lymphatic system. Medical conditions that can cause lymphoedema include:\n\nrheumatoid arthritis \u2013 which causes pain and swelling in the joints\neczema \u2013 which causes the skin to become itchy, reddened, dry and cracked\n\nVenous diseases, which affect the flow of blood through the veins, can cause lymphoedema in some people. The abnormal or damaged veins can result in excessive fluid leaking from the blood into the tissue spaces. This overwhelms and eventually exhausts the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining this fluid.\nSome venous diseases that can lead to lymphoedema include:\n\ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013 a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body\nvaricose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) \u2013 where poor drainage of blood in the veins causes higher vein pressure, and more fluid passes into the surrounding tissues\n\nPeople who are obese, particularly those who are severely obese, have an increased risk of developing lymphoedema. It\u2019s not clear exactly why this is, but it has been suggested that the extra fatty tissue affects the lymphatic channels in some way, reducing the flow of fluid through them.\nIn these cases, weight loss is an important part of treatment and even just starting to lose weight can make a big difference.\nIn a small number of cases, lymphoedema can be caused by an accidental injury to the lymphatic system. For example, lymphoedema can sometimes occur after extensive soft tissue loss or bruising.\nMovement and exercise helps lymph drainage, as muscle activity surrounding the lymphatic vessels massages fluid into and along them. Therefore, reduced movement can lead to lymphoedema, because the fluid in the lymphatic system does not get moved on, causing swelling.\nFor example, people who are unable to move fully for a long time due to an illness or surgery may be at risk of lymphoedema.\n\n\nIf you're being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you'll be monitored for the condition afterwards. Otherwise, see your GP if you experience symptoms of swelling.\nThere are a number of specialist lymphoedema treatment centres in the UK. Your doctor may refer you to one of these for further assessment. A list of treatment centres near you is available from the Lymphoedema Support Network.\nIn many cases, it's possible to make a diagnosis of lymphoedema by:\n\nasking about your symptoms and medical history\nexamining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it's enlarged\u00a0\n\nFurther tests\nAlthough not necessary in most cases, further tests may occasionally be used to assess and monitor your condition. These tests are explained below.\nIn some cases, tests to calculate the volume of an affected limb may be carried out. These may include:\n\na tape measure to measure the circumference of the limb at certain intervals, to calculate its volume\nwater displacement \u2013 where you place the affected limb in a tank of water and the amount of water that is displaced is measured to calculate the volume of the limb\nperometry \u2013 infrared light is used to measure the outline of an affected limb and calculate its volume\n\nDuring a bioimpedance test, electrodes (small metallic discs) are placed on different parts of your body. The electrodes release a small and painless electric charge that is measured using a handheld device. Changes in the strength of the current can indicate the presence of fluid in your tissue.\nImaging tests may also be used to help diagnose and monitor lymphoedema. These include:\n\na lymphoscintigraph \u2013 you are injected with a radioactive dye that can be tracked using a special scanner; this shows how the dye moves through your lymphatic system and can check for any blockages\na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of your body\u00a0\nan ultrasound scan \u2013 which uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body\na computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 which uses\u00a0X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the lymph nodes\n\nThese scans can be used to create a clearer picture of the affected tissue.\n\n\nThe recommended treatment for lymphoedema is decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT).\nDLT is not a cure for lymphoedema, but it can help control the symptoms. Although it takes time and effort, the treatment can be used to effectively control your lymphoedema.\nDecongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT)\nThere are four components to DLT:\n\ncompression bandages and garments \u2013 to move fluid out of the affected limb and minimise further build-up\nskin care \u2013 to keep the skin in good condition and reduce the chances of infection\nexercises \u2013 to use muscles in the affected limb to improve lymph drainage\nspecialised massage techniques \u2013 known as manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) \u2013 to stimulate the flow of fluid in the lymphatic system and reduce swelling\n\nEach of these components is described in more detail below.\nDLT usually begins with an intensive phase of therapy, during which you may receive daily treatment for several weeks to help reduce the volume of the affected body part.\nThis is followed by the second phase, known as the maintenance phase. During this, you will be encouraged to take over your own care by carrying out simple self-massage techniques, wearing compression garments and continuing to exercise. This phase of treatment aims to maintain the reduced size of the affected body part.\nYou may then have reviews every few months to check how your treatment is progressing.\nUnlike the blood circulation system, there is no central pump, such as the heart, to move fluid around the lymphatic system. Instead, the lymphatic system uses the massaging effect of surrounding muscles to move the fluid.\nIf you have lymphoedema, you will have special bandages or garments (such as sleeves, gloves, stockings or tights) fitted over any affected limbs. These will support the affected muscles during exercise and encourage them to move fluid out of the affected limb.\nThese may also be applied after a session of MLD, to prevent fluid accumulating in the limb again. This use of compression bandages and garments is known as multilayer lymphoedema bandaging.\nVelcro wraps may be used instead of bandages and have the advantage that the person with lymphoedema can apply them themselves.\nYou will be taught how to correctly apply your own bandages and compression garments, so you can continue to use them during the maintenance period.\nTaking good care of your skin is important, because it will reduce your risk of developing an infection, such as cellulitis.\nRead our page on preventing lymphoedema for more skin care advice.\nYour lymphoedema care team will help devise an exercise and movement plan designed to strengthen and stimulate the muscles involved in lymph drainage. They will also help you to lose weight, if you are overweight. This will be tailored to your requirements and ability.\nYour plan may involve specific limb exercises, as well as gentle activities that involve the whole body, such as swimming, cycling and walking.\nTo begin with, you may receive specialised massages called manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) \u2013 usually carried out by a specialist therapist \u2013 to move fluid from the swollen areas into working lymph nodes, where it can be drained.\nYour lymphoedema therapist will also teach you a range of simpler massage techniques that you or your carer can use during the maintenance phase of treatment, to help keep the swelling down. These self-massage techniques are known as simple lymphatic drainage (SLD).\nSurgery\nIn a small number of cases, surgery may be considered to treat lymphoedema. There are three main types of surgery that may be useful for the condition:\n\nthe removal of sections of excess skin and underlying tissue (debulking)\nthe removal of fat from the affected limb (liposuction) \u2013 see below\nthe restoration of the flow of fluid around the affected section of the lymphatic system \u2013 for example, by connecting the lymphatic system to nearby blood vessels (lymphaticovenular anastomosis)\n\nThese treatments may help to reduce the size of areas of the body affected by lymphoedema, but some are still experimental \u2013 particularly lymphaticovenular anastomosis \u2013 and are not in widespread use.\nLiposuction is where a thin tube is inserted through small incisions in the skin to suck fat out of tissue. It can be used to remove excess fat from an affected limb to help reduce its size.\nOnce the surgery is complete, you will have to wear a compression garment on the affected limb day and night for at least a year to help keep the swelling down.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states that liposuction for chronic (long-term) lymphoedema appears to be safe, and may be effective in the short term. However, NICE says there is not enough evidence of its long-term effectiveness and safety.\nAccess to liposuction for lymphoedema may be limited, depending on what is available from your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).\n\n\nCellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema, but psychological issues can also occur as a result of the condition.\nThese complications are explained below.\nCellulitis\nMany people with lymphoedema experience repeated episodes of\u00a0cellulitis (also known as erysipelas). Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) and the layer of fat and soft tissues (the subcutaneous tissues) that lie underneath the skin. Cellulitis can occur as a result of lymphoedema and can also cause the condition.\nSymptoms of cellulitis can include:\n\nredness and a feeling of heat in the skin\npain in the affected area\na high temperature (fever)\nchills\n\nCellulitis can usually be successfully treated with antibiotics, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital.\nIn some cases, you may be provided with a short supply of antibiotic tablets to use as soon as you notice symptoms of cellulitis. Alternatively, you may be given a long-term course of antibiotics to take to prevent infection.\nPsychological impact\nLiving with a chronic (long-term) condition that affects your appearance, such as lymphoedema, can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of depression.\nIf you have been feeling particularly down for the last few months and you no longer take pleasure in the things you usually enjoy, you may be depressed. If this is the case, talk to your GP or members of your lymphoedema treatment team, because there are effective treatments for depression.\nTalking to other people who also have lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety. The\u00a0Lymphoedema Support Network offers information and advice, and can put you in touch with a support group in your area.\nRemember: if you persevere with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable.\u00a0\nRead more about\u00a0treating lymphoedema\n\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to completely prevent lymphoedema, but the following steps may help reduce your chances of developing the condition.\nIf you already have lymphoedema, this advice may stop it getting worse.\nSkin care\nThe part of your body affected by lymphoedema is more vulnerable to infection of the build-up of fluid within the tissues. Any cuts in your skin can allow bacteria to enter your body and may quickly develop into an infection.\nSkin infections can also damage your lymphatic system and cause lymphoedema to develop.\nYou can reduce your chances of developing skin infections by:\n\nnot having injections or blood pressure readings in the affected area whenever possible\ntreating cuts and scratches immediately with an antiseptic cream\nusing insect repellents to prevent\u00a0insect bites\nmoisturising the skin daily to keep it supple \u2013 your GP can prescribe a suitable cream\navoiding very hot baths and showers \u2013 the heat from saunas, steam rooms and sun beds may also increase the swelling\nusing sun cream with a high sun protection factor (SPF) to prevent sunburn\nwearing gloves for gardening and household tasks to avoid cuts, if your upper limbs are affected\nusing anti-fungal powder to prevent fungal infections in your skin or feet, if your lower limbs are affected\ncutting your nails with nail clippers\nseeing a chiropodist for foot and nail care \u2013 but make sure you tell them you have lymphoedema\nwearing shoes that fit correctly and provide support on the top of your feet, if your lower limbs are affected\nusing an electric razor if you need to shave to reduce the risk of cutting yourself\nnot wearing tight-fitting clothes or jewellery\u00a0\n\nContact your GP as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of a possible skin infection, such as redness and a feeling of heat in the skin.\nHealthy lifestyle\nAdopting a healthy lifestyle may also help reduce your risk of developing lymphoedema, and may help control the condition if you already have it.\nThis includes:\n\neating a healthy diet\nmaintaining a healthy weight\nexercising regularly\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. If it isn't diagnosed and treated quickly, it can be fatal.\nA single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected.\nSymptoms of malaria\nIt's important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you're travelling to areas where there's a high risk of the disease. This means that you can get medical attention quickly.\nSymptoms are similar to those of flu and usually appear 6 to 30 days after the mosquito bite, but it can sometimes take up to a year for symptoms to start.\nThe initial symptoms of malaria include:\n\na high temperature (fever)\nheadache\nsweats\nchills\nmuscle aches or pains\nvomiting and or diarrhoea\n\nThese symptoms can start mild and may be difficult to identify as malaria.\nWhen to seek medical attention\nMalaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. It can be fatal if not treated quickly.\nThe effects of malaria are usually more severe in:\n\nbabies\nyoung children\npregnant women\nolder people\n\nWhat causes malaria?\nMalaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.\nThere are 5 different types of Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. They are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be.\nAll malaria infections cause the same symptoms and require immediate medical attention. It's not possible to find out which type of malaria you have from symptoms alone.\nHow malaria is spread\nThe Plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. These are known as 'night-biting' mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise.\nWhen a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. Malaria can't be spread directly from person to person.\nWhen an infected mosquito bites, the parasite enters the blood and travels to the liver. In the liver, it develops for days to weeks before re-entering the blood. This is the point where symptoms develop and urgent treatment is required.\nAlthough it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection through blood transfusions\u00a0and sharing needles.\nWhere is malaria found?\nMalaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is not found in the UK or Europe.\nThe fitfortravel website has more information about the risk of malaria in individual countries.\nComplications of malaria\nMalaria is a serious illness that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated quickly. Severe complications of malaria can occur within hours or days of the first symptoms. This means it is important to seek urgent medical help as soon as possible.\nThe destruction of red blood cells by the malaria parasite can cause severe anaemia.\nAnaemia is a condition where the red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen to the body's muscles and organs. This can leave you feeling drowsy, weak and faint.\nIn rare cases, malaria can affect the brain. This is known as cerebral malaria which can cause your brain to swell, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage. It can also cause fits (seizures) or coma.\nOther complications\nOther complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include:\n\nliver failure and jaundice \u2013 yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes\nshock \u2013 a sudden drop in blood pressure\npulmonary oedema \u2013 a build-up of fluid in the lungs\nacute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nabnormally low blood sugar \u2013 hypoglycaemia\nkidney failure\nswelling and rupturing of the spleen\ndehydration\n\nMalaria in pregnancy\nIf you get malaria while pregnant, you and your baby have an increased risk of developing serious complications like:\n\npremature birth \u2013 birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy\nlow birth weight\nrestricted growth of the baby in the womb\nstillbirth\nmiscarriage\ndeath of the mother\n\nPregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to regions with a risk of malaria.\n\n\nIf you travel to an area that has malaria, you are at risk of the infection. It's very important that you take precautions to prevent the disease and get treatment immediately if symptoms do develop.\nPreventing malaria\nMalaria can often be avoided using the ABCD approach to prevention, which stands for:\n\nAwareness of risk \u2013 find out whether you're at risk of getting malaria\nBite prevention \u2013 use insect repellent, cover your skin with clothing, and use a mosquito net to avoid mosquito bites\nCheck whether you need to take antimalarial prevention tablets by visiting a travel health clinic - if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose and finish the course\nDiagnosis \u2013 seek immediate medical advice if you have malaria symptoms, including up to a year after you return from travelling\n\nBeing aware of the risks\nTo check whether you are travelling to a malaria risk area see the fitfortravel or National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) websites.\nVisit your local travel clinic for malaria advice as soon as you know that you are travelling to a risk area.\nIf you grew up in a country where malaria is common, any natural protection will be quickly lost when you move. This means you need to protect yourself from infection if you're now travelling to a risk area, even if that\u2019s where you grew up.\nFurther information about travel health and vaccinations.\nPreventing mosquito bites\nAvoiding mosquito bites is one of the best ways to prevent malaria. This is particularly important during early evening and at night when mosquitoes bite.\nThere are several steps you can take to avoid being bitten.\nThe most effective repellents contain 50% diethyltoluamide (DEET). These are available in:\n\nsprays\nroll-ons\nsticks\ncreams\n\nThere's no evidence to suggest that other remedies protect against malaria, such as homeopathic remedies, electronic buzzers, vitamins B1 or B12, garlic, yeast extract spread (Marmite), tea tree oils or bath oils.\nFurther information on mosquito bite prevention is available from the fitfortravel or National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) websites.\nAntimalarial tablets\nAntimalarial tablets can help prevent you from developing a malaria infection. For the best protection, you must also follow mosquito bite prevention advice.\nYou must start taking antimalarial tablets before travel and continue taking them whilst travelling in the risk area. Antimalarial tablets must also be taken for a period of time after you have left the risk area.\nHow long antimalarial tablets should be taken will depend on which tablet is used.\nAntimalarial tablets don\u2019t stop malaria from entering your body. However, they do stop the infection from developing inside your body and prevent you from getting ill.\nIf you stop taking your antimalarial tablets early (even when you are back in the UK) you could still become ill with malaria.\nTaking antimalarial medication\nYou may need to take a short trial course of antimalarial tablets before travelling. This is to check that side effects do not occur and that you do not have an adverse reaction. If you do, alternative antimalarials can be prescribed before you leave.\nThere's currently no vaccine available that offers protection against malaria.\nTypes of antimalarial medication\nThe type of antimalarial tablets that you will be recommended is based on the following information:\n\nwhere you're going\nany relevant family medical history\nyour medical history, including any allergies to medication\nany medication you're currently taking\nany problems you've had with antimalarial medicines in the past\nyour age\nwhether you're pregnant\n\nIf you've taken antimalarial medication in the past, don't assume it's suitable for future trips.\nThe type of antimalarial that you will need to take depends on which strain of malaria is carried by the mosquitoes in an area. It will also depend on whether they're resistant to certain types of antimalarial medication.\nThe main types of antimalarials used to prevent malaria are:\n\nAtovaquone plus proguanil (also known as Maloff protect or Malarone)\nDoxycycline (also known as Vibramycin-D)\nMefloquine (also known as Lariam)\n\nTo find out what type of antimalarial medication is best for you, visit your local travel clinic.\nTreating malaria\nIf malaria is diagnosed and treated quickly, you should fully recover. Treatment should be started as soon as possible.\nTreatment begins in a hospital to make sure complications don\u2019t suddenly develop. Treatment is with tablets or capsules. If someone is very ill, treatment will be given through a drip into a vein in the arm (intravenously).\nTreatment for malaria can leave you feeling very tired and weak for several weeks.\nThe type of medicine and how long you need to take it will depend on:\n\nthe type of malaria you have\nthe severity of your symptoms\nwhether you took preventative antimalarial tablets\nyour age\nwhether you're pregnant\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "A malignant brain tumour is a fast-growing cancer that spreads to other areas of the brain and spine.\nGenerally, brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4, according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. A malignant brain tumour is either grade 3 or 4, whereas grade 1 or 2 tumours are usually classed as benign or non-cancerous.\u00a0\nMost malignant tumours are secondary cancers, which means they started in another part of the body and spread to the brain. Primary brain tumours are those that started in the brain.\nThese pages focus on high-grade brain tumours. For information about grade\u00a01 or\u00a02 tumours, read our pages on\u00a0low-grade (benign) brain tumours.\nSigns and\u00a0symptoms\nThe symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain.\nCommon symptoms include:\n\nsevere, persistent\u00a0headaches\nseizures (fits)\npersistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness\nmental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality\nprogressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems\n\nSpeak to your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of\u00a0malignant brain tumours\u00a0and diagnosing\u00a0malignant brain tumours.\nTypes of malignant tumours\nMost\u00a0malignant brain tumours develop from the glial\u00a0tissue, which supports the brain's nerve cells.\u00a0These tumours are known as\u00a0gliomas.\nGliomas can be separated further, depending on the cells they developed from. For example:\n\nan astrocytoma develops from cells thought to provide the brain's framework\nan oligodendroglioma develops from the cells that produce the fatty covering of nerves\nan ependymoma develops from the cells that line the cavities in the brain\n\nIt's also possible to have a malignant tumour that's a mixture of these types or developed in a different part of the brain.\nWho is affected\nBrain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults.\nThe exact cause of primary malignant brain tumours is unknown, although it's thought that certain genetic conditions and previous\u00a0radiotherapy treatment to the head may increase the risk of one developing.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of malignant brain tumours.\nHow malignant brain tumours are treated\nA primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord.\nSurgery will usually need to be carried out to remove as much of the tumour as possible. This may be\u00a0followed by\u00a0radiotherapy\u00a0and/or chemotherapy\u00a0to kill any cancerous cells left behind and reduce the chances of the tumour regrowing.\nHowever, malignant tumours will often eventually return after treatment. If this happens, or if you have a secondary tumour, a cure isn't usually possible and treatment can instead be used to improve symptoms and prolong life.\nRead\u00a0more about treating malignant brain tumours.\nLiving with a brain tumour\nLiving with a brain tumour is not easy.\u00a0You may feel\u00a0worried and anxious about what's going to happen to you and your family. This is perfectly normal.\nIt can help to seek accurate medical information about your specific tumour and its treatment, make sure you're closely involved in decisions about your care, and ask your care team about anything you're not sure about.\nYou can read more about living with a brain tumour on The Brain Tumour Charity's website.\nYour doctor\u00a0may be able to\u00a0refer you to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of diagnosis and treatment. There are also many organisations and helplines that can help, such as\u00a0The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\nSupport for carers\nBeing a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others, it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing.\nResearch on carers\u2019 health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.\nHowever, neglecting your own health doesn't work in the long term. If you're caring for someone else, it\u2019s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It's in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.\nFor more information on the support available to you and benefits you may be entitled to, visit\u00a0Care Information Scotland.\n\n\nThe symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain.\nWhen symptoms do occur, it is because the brain tumour is either putting pressure on the brain or preventing an area of the brain from functioning properly.\nSigns of increased pressure on the brain\nCommon symptoms of increased pressure within the skull include:\n\nsevere, persistent\u00a0headaches \u2013 which are typically worse in the morning or when bending over or coughing\npersistent nausea and vomiting\ndrowsiness\nvision problems \u2013 such as\u00a0blurred vision,\u00a0floaters and\u00a0loss of vision that may come and go\nseizures (fits) \u2013 which may affect the whole body or just involve a twitch in one area\n\nSymptoms caused by the position of a tumour\nDifferent areas of the brain control different functions, so the symptoms caused by a brain tumour will depend on where the tumour is located. For example, a tumour affecting:\n\nthe frontal lobe may cause changes in personality, weakness in one side of the body and loss of smell\nthe temporal lobe may cause\u00a0forgetfulness,\u00a0language problems (aphasia) and seizures\nthe parietal lobe may cause aphasia and\u00a0numbness or weakness in one side of the body\nthe occipital lobe may cause loss of vision on one side\nthe cerebellum may cause a loss of co-ordination, flickering of the eyes, vomiting and a stiff neck\nthe brain stem may cause unsteadiness and difficulty walking, facial weakness, double vision, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing (dysphagia)\n\nWhen to speak to your GP\nIt's important to speak to a doctor if you develop persistent and worrying symptoms that may be caused by a brain tumour. While it's unlikely that you have a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nIf your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.\nRead more about diagnosing\u00a0malignant brain tumours.\n\n\nMost malignant brain tumours are caused by a cancer that started somewhere else in the body and spread to the brain, through the bloodstream. These are known as secondary tumours.\nCancers that can spread to the brain include lung cancer, breast cancer, bowel cancer and melanoma skin cancer.\nSome primary malignant brain cancers\u00a0(cancerous tumours that start in the brain) are caused by a previously\u00a0benign brain tumour becoming cancerous, but usually the exact reason why a primary\u00a0tumour develops is unknown.\nAge\nBrain tumours affect people of all ages, including children, but the risk tends to increase as you get older. Most tumours affect people over 50 years of age.\nFamily history\nPeople with a family history of brain tumours may be at a slightly increased risk of developing\u00a0a brain tumour themselves.\nRadiotherapy\nIf your brain is exposed to radiation during\u00a0radiotherapy, your risk of developing\u00a0certain types of\u00a0brain tumour later on is increased.\nGenetic conditions\nSome genetic conditions can increase your risk of a brain tumour, such as:\n\nneurofibromatosis type 1\u00a0or\u00a0neurofibromatosis type 2\ntuberous sclerosis\u00a0\nTurcot syndrome\nLi-Fraumeni cancer syndrome\nvon Hippel-Lindau syndrome\nGorlin syndrome\n\nUnlike most brain tumours, tumours associated with these conditions tend to develop\u00a0in childhood or early adulthood.\nCan mobile phones cause brain tumours?\nThere have been\u00a0reports in the media about a possible connection between brain tumours and the radiofrequency (RF) energy emitted by mobile phones. RF energy produces heat, which can increase body temperature and damage tissue exposed to it.\nHowever, it's thought that the amount of RF energy people are exposed to from mobile phones is too low to produce significant tissue heating or an increase in body temperature.\nResearch is underway to establish whether RF energy has any long-term health effects, but the balance of evidence currently available suggests that it's unlikely\u00a0mobile phones cause health problems.\n\n\nSpeak to your GP if you develop any of the symptoms of a malignant brain tumour, such as a persistent and severe headache.\nYour GP will\u00a0examine you and ask about your symptoms. They may also carry out a simple neurological examination.\nIf they suspect you may have a tumour, or they are not sure what's causing your symptoms, you'll probably be referred to a neurologist (brain and nerve specialist).\nNeurological examination\nYour GP or neurologist may\u00a0carry out a test of your nervous system, called a neurological examination, to look for problems associated with a\u00a0brain tumour.\nThis\u00a0may involve tests of your:\n\nhand and limb strength\nreflexes, such as your knee-jerk reflex\nhearing and vision\nskin sensitivity\nbalance and co-ordination\nmemory and mental agility (using simple questions or arithmetic)\n\nA neurologist may also recommend one or more\u00a0further tests.\nFurther tests\nOther tests you may have to help diagnose a brain tumour include:\n\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a series of X-rays\na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0\u2013 this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a strong magnetic field and radio waves\u00a0\u00a0\nan electroencephalogram (EEG)\u00a0\u2013 where electrodes attached to your scalp record your brain activity to look for any abnormalities\n\nIf a tumour is suspected, a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tissue) may be taken to establish the type of tumour and the most effective treatment.\nUnder anaesthetic, a small hole (known as a burr hole) is made in the skull and a very fine needle is used to obtain a sample of tumour tissue. You'll probably need to stay in hospital for a few days afterwards.\n\n\nIf you have a malignant brain tumour, you'll usually need surgery to remove as much of it as possible. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may then be used to treat any remaining cancerous tissue.\nThe aim of this is to remove or destroy as much of the tumour as possible, ideally getting rid of the\u00a0cancerous cells completely. However, this isn't always possible and most\u00a0malignant\u00a0brain tumours will eventually return after treatment.\nIf your tumour does return after treatment, or you\u00a0have a secondary brain tumour (where cancer has spread to your brain from another part of your body), a cure isn't usually possible. Treatment\u00a0can instead\u00a0be used\u00a0to control your symptoms and\u00a0prolong life.\nYour treatment plan\nThere are a number of different treatments for\u00a0malignant brain tumours, and deciding on what you feel is the best treatment can be confusing.\nA group of different specialists called a multidisciplinary team (MDT) will be involved in your care and will recommend what they think is the best treatment option for you, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions that you'd like to ask. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nSurgery\nSurgery will be recommended for most people with a malignant brain tumour. If the size or position of the tumour mean surgery is not possible, one or more of the treatments described below may be recommended instead.\nThe main operation used to treat people with brain tumours is called a craniotomy. You will be given a\u00a0general anaesthetic so you are asleep while the\u00a0procedure is carried out. An area of your scalp will be shaved and a section of the skull is cut out as a flap to reveal the brain and tumour underneath.\nThe surgeon can then remove as\u00a0much of the tumour as possible and secure the flap of skull back in place with metal screws.\nAfter surgery, treatment with\u00a0radiotherapy\u00a0and/or chemotherapy may be recommended to kill any cancer cells left behind and reduce the risk of the tumour coming back.\u00a0\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0is a treatment where a beam of\u00a0high-energy radiation\u00a0is focused on the tumour to kill the cancerous cells. It can be used after surgery or as the main treatment for tumours that\u00a0are difficult to remove.\nRadiotherapy is\u00a0usually given in several doses (fractions) spread over the course of a week. An entire course of treatment will usually last up to 6 weeks in total.\nPossible side effects of radiotherapy for a brain tumour include nausea, temporary hair loss, tiredness and red, sore skin. Read more about the side effects of radiotherapy.\nIn a small\u00a0number of cases, a similar treatment called\u00a0proton beam therapy may be recommended. However, this is only suitable in very specific cases and currently, you'll need to be referred\u00a0for treatment abroad if your doctor thinks it's appropriate.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a medication used to kill cancerous cells. It may be\u00a0used alongside radiotherapy or on its\u00a0own, either\u00a0to help kill any cancerous cells left\u00a0behind after surgery or to help relieve your symptoms when a cure is not possible.\nChemotherapy medication for brain tumours can be given in a number of ways, including as:\n\ntablets (orally) \u2013\u00a0temozolomide and procarbazine\u00a0are given in this way\ninjections into a vein (intravenously) \u2013\u00a0vincristine is given in this way\nsmall, disc-like\u00a0implants placed in the brain during surgery \u2013 carmustine\u00a0can be\u00a0given in this way, but is\u00a0only recommended if\u00a090% or more of the tumour has been\u00a0removed\n\nThe side effects of chemotherapy largely depend on the specific medication you're taking. Common general side effects include tiredness, headaches, temporary hair loss and nausea. Read more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nFor more information about some of the treatments used, see the guidelines from the\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on carmustine implants to treat gliomas\u00a0and temozolomide for recurrent malignant glioma.\nRadiosurgery\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)\u00a0is a special type of radiotherapy that's sometimes used to treat brain tumours that can't be safely removed with surgery.\nDuring the treatment, several small beams of radiation are used to very accurately\u00a0deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumour,\u00a0usually in a single treatment session.\u00a0\nAs the radiation beams can be aimed very precisely, a high dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumour with minimal damage to the surrounding healthy cells.\nThis means you're less likely to experience many of the usual side effects of radiotherapy. Recovery\u00a0tends to be much faster\u00a0and an overnight stay isn't usually\u00a0necessary.\nHowever, radiosurgery is currently only available in a few specialised centres across the UK and is only suitable for certain people, based on the characteristics of their tumour.\nTreating symptoms\nYou may also be given medication to relieve some of the symptoms you may\u00a0have as a result of your\u00a0brain tumour.\nThese may include:\n\nanticonvulsants to prevent seizures (fits)\ncorticosteroids to reduce\u00a0swelling and pressure in the brain\npainkillers to treat\u00a0headaches\nanti-emetics to prevent vomiting\n\nDepending on your circumstances, these medications may be given before, after, or instead of surgery.\nChoosing not to have treatment\nIf your tumour is at an advanced stage or in a difficult place in the brain, a cure may not be possible and treatment may only be able to control the cancer for a period of time. This means you will be getting the side effects of treatment without getting rid of the tumour.\nIn this situation, it may be difficult to decide whether or not to go ahead with treatment. Talk to your doctor about what will happen if you choose not to be treated, so you can make an informed decision.\nIf you decide not to have treatment, you will still be given palliative care, which will control your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.\n\n\nAfter being treated for a brain tumour, you may need additional care to monitor and treat any further problems.\nFollow-up appointments\nMalignant\u00a0brain tumours often grow back after treatment, so regular follow-up appointments will be recommended to look for signs that this may have happened.\nThese appointments may include a discussion of any worrying new symptoms you experience, a physical examination, and\u00a0occasionally a brain scan.\nYou will\u00a0usually\u00a0have follow-up appointments at least every few months to begin with, but they may be needed less frequently over time if no problems develop.\nSupportive treatment\nProblems caused by a brain tumour\u00a0don't always resolve as soon as\u00a0the tumour is removed or treated. For example, some people have persistent weakness, seizures (fits), difficulty walking and speech problems.\nIn these cases,\u00a0you may need\u00a0extra support to help you overcome or adapt to\u00a0any problems you have. This may include\u00a0therapies such as:\n\nphysiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 to help with any movement problems you have\noccupational therapy \u2013 to identify any problems you're having with daily activities and\u00a0arrange for\u00a0any equipment or alterations to your home that may help\nspeech therapy \u2013 to help you with any\u00a0communication or swallowing problems\n\nSome people may also need to continue taking medication for seizures for a few months or more after their tumour has been treated or removed.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made recommendations on the standards of care that brain tumour patients should receive. For more information, see the\u00a0service guidance for improving outcomes for people with brain and other central nervous system tumours.\nDriving\u00a0and travelling\nYou may not be allowed to drive for a while after you've had a brain tumour. This will\u00a0depend on things such as\u00a0the type of brain tumour you had, where it was in the brain, and what symptoms you have.\nIf you are required to give up your driving licence and notify the DVLA, they will speak to your GP or specialist\u00a0to determine when you can drive again.\nWith up-to-date scans and advice from your medical team, you may be allowed to drive again once an agreed period has passed and you have successfully completed a medical test to determine your ability to control a vehicle.\nYou can find out about\u00a0brain tumours and driving on the Cancer Research UK website.\nFlying is usually possible from 3 months after treatment.\nSports and activities\nAfter you have been treated for a brain tumour, you must permanently avoid contact sports, such as rugby and boxing. You can start other activities again, with the agreement of your doctor, once you have recovered.\nSwimming unsupervised is not recommended for around 1 year after treatment, as there is a risk you could have an\u00a0epileptic fit while in the water.\nSex and pregnancy\nIt's safe to have sex after treatment for a brain tumour.\nWomen may be advised to avoid becoming pregnant for 6 months or more after treatment.\u00a0If you're planning to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your medical team.\nGoing back to work\nYou'll usually tire\u00a0more easily following treatment for a brain tumour.\nYou may wish to return to work and normal life as soon as possible, but it's probably a good idea to return part-time to begin with and only go back full-time when you feel able to.\nIf you've experienced seizures,\u00a0you shouldn't\u00a0work with machinery or at heights.\nEmotional support\nA brain tumour is often life-changing. You may feel angry, frightened and emotionally drained. If it will help, your doctor or specialist may be able to refer you to a social worker and counsellor for help with the practical and emotional aspects of your diagnosis.\nThere are also many organisations that can\u00a0provide information and support, such as\u00a0The Brain Tumour Charity and Brain Tumour Research.\nSocial support\nIf you have been diagnosed with a brain tumour, your treatment and medical care will probably be the first thing on your mind. But there are other aspects of your life to think about and it is important to know exactly what kind of assistance is available and where you can get it.\nIf you are finding it hard to cope with day-to-day life, talk about your needs with your doctor or nurse, who will refer you to a social worker. Your social worker will assess exactly the kind of help you need.\nHelp you may need might include:\n\na care attendant, who can help with housework, dressing and washing, or even just keep you company and give your carer a break\na 'meals on wheels' service\nincome support, disability living allowance or attendance allowance\nequipment and\u00a0adaptations\u00a0for your home\n\nFor more information about what\u00a0help you\u00a0might need and how you can access it, visit Care Information Scotland.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications.\u00a0It's now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccination.\nAnyone can get measles if they haven't been vaccinated or they haven't had it before, although it's most common in young children.\nThe infection usually clears in around 7 to 10 days.\nThe initial\u00a0symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected.

These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).\nRead more about the complications of measles\nThe measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\nYou can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours.\nPeople\u00a0with measles\u00a0are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about four days after the rash first appears.\nMeasles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\nThis is given in two doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The first dose is given when your child is around 12 months old and a second dose is given from age 3 years 4 months.\nAdults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they haven't been fully vaccinated before. Ask your GP about having the vaccination.\nIf the MMR vaccine isn't suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you're at immediate risk of catching measles.\nRead more about preventing measles\nThere are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection, including:\n\ntaking\u00a0paracetamol or\u00a0ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains\u00a0\u2013 aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old\ndrinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration\nclosing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity\nusing damp cotton wool to clean the eyes\nstaying off school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears\n\nIn severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.\nRead more about treating measles\n\n\nMeasles starts with cold-like symptoms that develop about 10 days after becoming infected.

This is known as acute otitis media. The main symptoms include:\n\nearache\na high temperature (fever)\nbeing sick\na lack of energy\nslight hearing loss - if the middle ear becomes filled with fluid\n\nIn some cases, a hole may develop in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) and pus may run out of the ear. The earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves.\nAs babies are unable to communicate the source of their discomfort, it can be difficult to tell what's wrong with them. Signs that a young child might have an ear infection include:\n\nraised temperature\npulling, tugging or rubbing their ear\nirritability, poor feeding or restlessness at night\ncoughing or a runny nose\nunresponsiveness to quiet sounds or other signs of difficulty hearing, such as inattentiveness\nloss of balance\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nMost cases of otitis media pass within a few days, so there's usually no need to see your GP.\nHowever, see your GP if you or your child have:\n\nsymptoms showing no sign of improvement after two or three days\na lot of pain\na discharge of pus or fluid from the ear \u2013 some people develop a persistent and painless ear discharge that lasts for many months, known as chronic suppurative otitis media\nan underlying health condition, such as cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease, which could make complications more likely\n\nRead more about diagnosing middle ear infections\nHow middle ear infections are treated\nMost ear infections clear up within three to five days and don't need any specific treatment. If necessary, paracetamol or ibuprofen should be used to relieve pain and a high temperature.\nMake sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age. Read more about giving your child painkillers.\nAntibiotics aren't routinely used to treat middle ear infections, although they may occasionally be prescribed if symptoms persist or are particularly severe.\nRead more about treating middle ear infections\nWhat causes middle ear infections?\nMost middle ear infections occur when an infection such as a cold, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear and causes the Eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked.\nThis mean mucus can't drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear.\nAn enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the Eustachian tube. The adenoid can be removed if it causes persistent or frequent ear infections. Read more about removing adenoids.\nYounger children are particularly vulnerable to middle ear infections as:\n\nthe Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults\na child's adenoids are relatively much larger than an adults\n\nCertain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including:\n\nhaving a cleft palate \u2013 a type of birth defect where a child has a split in the roof of their mouth\nhaving Down's syndrome \u2013 a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features\n\nCan middle ear infections be prevented?\nIt's not possible to prevent middle ear infections, but there are some things you can do that may reduce your child's risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\nmake sure your child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations \u2013 particularly the pneumococcal vaccine and the DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB (6-in-1) vaccine\navoid exposing your child to smoky environments (passive smoking)\ndon't give your child a dummy once they're older than six to 12 months old\ndon't feed your child while they're lying flat on their back\nif possible, feed your baby with breast milk rather than formula milk\n\nAvoiding contact with other children who are unwell may also help reduce your child's chances of catching an infection that could lead to a middle ear infection.\nFurther problems\nComplications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious if they do occur.\nMost complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head, including:\n\nthe bones behind the ear (mastoiditis)\nthe inner ear (labyrinthitis)\nthe protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis)\n\nRarely, infections can leave a perforation or hole in the eardrum.\nIf complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital.\nRead more about the complications of middle ear infections\n\n\nA middle ear infection (otitis media) can usually be diagnosed using an instrument called an otoscope.\nAn otoscope is a small handheld device with a magnifying glass and a light source at the end. Using an otoscope, a\u00a0doctor\u00a0can\u00a0examine the ear to look for signs of fluid in the middle ear, which may indicate an infection.\nSigns of fluid in the middle ear can include the ear drum:\n\nbulging\nbeing an unusual colour (usually red or yellow)\nhaving a cloudy appearance\n\nIn some cases, a hole may have developed in the eardrum (perforated ear drum) and there may be fluid in the ear canal (the tube between the outer ear and eardrum).\nSome otoscopes can also be used to blow a small puff of air into the ear to check for any blockages in the middle ear, which\u00a0could be a sign of an infection.\u00a0If the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects\u00a0the throat and middle ear) is clear, the eardrum will move slightly.\u00a0If it's blocked, the eardrum will remain still.\nFurther\u00a0tests\nFurther tests are normally only required if treatment\u00a0isn't working or complications develop.\u00a0These tests will usually be carried out at your local ear, nose and throat (ENT) department.\nSome of the\u00a0tests that may be carried out are described below.\nTympanometry is a test that measures how the ear drum reacts to changes in air pressure.\nDuring a tympanometry test, a probe is placed into your child's ear. The probe changes the air pressure at regular intervals while transmitting a sound into the ear. A measuring device is attached to the probe to record how the drum moves and how changes in air pressure affect this movement.\nA healthy ear drum should move easily if there's a change in air pressure. If your child's ear drum moves slowly or not at all, it usually suggests there's fluid behind it.\nAudiometry is a hearing test that uses a machine called an audiometer to produce sounds of different volume and frequency. This can help determine if your child has any hearing loss as a result of their condition.\nDuring the test, your child listens through headphones and is asked if\u00a0they can hear\u00a0the sounds.\nOn the very rare occasions where there's a possibility the infection has spread out of the middle ear and into the surrounding area, a scan of the ear may be carried out. This may be\u00a0either a:\n\ncomputerised\u00a0tomography (CT) scan\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n\nA CT scan takes a series of\u00a0X-rays and uses a computer to assemble the scans into a more detailed image, whereas an MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images of the inside of the body.\n\n\nMost middle ear infections (otitis media) clear up within three to five days and don't need any specific treatment.\nYou can relieve any pain and a high temperature using over the counter painkillers such as paracetamol\u00a0and ibuprofen.\nMake sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age.\nPlacing a warm flannel or washcloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain until the condition passes.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics aren't routinely used to treat middle ear infections as there's no evidence that they speed up the healing process. Many cases are\u00a0caused by viruses, which antibiotics aren't effective against.\nUsing antibiotics to treat minor bacterial infections also increases the likelihood of bacteria\u00a0becoming\u00a0resistant to them over time. This\u00a0means more serious infections could become untreatable in the future. Read about antibiotic resistance\u00a0for more information.\nIf antibiotics are needed,\u00a0a five-day course of an antibiotic called amoxicillin is\u00a0usually prescribed. This is often given as a liquid. Common side effects of amoxicillin include:\u00a0\n\na rash\nfeeling sick\ndiarrhoea\n\nAn alternative antibiotic such as erythromycin\u00a0or clarithromycin may be used for people allergic to amoxicillin.\nIn some cases, your GP\u00a0may give you\u00a0a prescription that you can choose to pick up a few days later if the condition hasn't improved by then.\nAdults and children who develop a long-term middle ear infection (chronic suppurative otitis media) may benefit from short courses of antibiotic ear drops.\nAntibiotics\u00a0are usually only considered\u00a0if your child:\n\nhas a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to\u00a0complications, such as\u00a0cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease\nis less than three months old\nis less than\u00a0two years old with an infection in both ears\nhas\u00a0discharge coming from their ear\n\nAdults may be prescribed antibiotics if:\n\nthey have\u00a0a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to\u00a0complications, such as\u00a0cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease\nsymptoms are showing no signs of improvement after four days\n\nGrommets\nFor children with recurrent severe middle ear infections, tiny tubes may be inserted\u00a0into the eardrum to help drain fluid. These tubes are called grommets.\nGrommets are inserted under\u00a0general anaesthetic, which means your child\u00a0will be\u00a0asleep and won't feel any pain. The procedure\u00a0usually only takes about 15 minutes and your child should be able to go home the same day.\nA grommet helps keep the eardrum open for several months. As the eardrum starts to heal, the grommet will slowly be pushed out of the eardrum and eventually falls out. This process happens naturally and shouldn't be painful. Most grommets fall out within\u00a0six to 12 months of being inserted.\nSome children need another procedure to replace the grommets if they're still experiencing problems.\nTreatment with grommets isn't routinely funded in all areas or for adults with recurrent otitis media.\n\n\nSerious complications of middle ear infections (otitis media) are very rare but very young children are still at risk because their immune systems are still developing.\nSome of the main complications associated with middle ear infections are detailed below.\nMastoiditis\nMastoiditis\u00a0can develop if an infection spreads out of the middle ear and into the area of bone underneath the ear (the mastoids).\nSymptoms of mastoiditis can include:\n\na high temperature (fever)\nswelling behind the ear, which pushes it forward\u00a0\nredness and tenderness or pain behind the ear\na creamy discharge from the ear\u00a0\nheadache\nhearing loss\n\nMastoiditis is usually treated\u00a0in hospital with antibiotics given through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously). In some cases, surgery may be required\u00a0to drain the ear and remove the infected mastoid bone.\nCholesteatoma\nA cholesteatoma\u00a0is\u00a0an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear that can sometimes develop as a result of recurring or persistent middle ear infections.\nIf it's not treated, a cholesteatoma can eventually damage the delicate structures deep inside your ear, such as the tiny bones that are essential for hearing.\nSymptoms of a cholesteatoma can include:\n\nhearing loss\nweakness in half your face\ndizziness\ntinnitus\u00a0\u2013 hearing sounds\u00a0from inside their body rather than from an outside source\n\nIn most cases, surgery is required to remove a cholesteatoma.\nLabyrinthitis\nIn some cases, an infection in the middle ear can spread into the inner ear and affect the delicate structure deep inside the ear called the labyrinth. This is known as labyrinthitis.\nSymptoms of labyrinthitis can include:\n\ndizziness\nvertigo\u00a0(the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning)\nloss of balance\nhearing loss\n\nThe symptoms of labyrinthitis usually pass within a few weeks, although medication to relieve the symptoms and treat the underlying infection may sometimes be prescribed. Read more about treating labyrinthitis.\nProblems with speech and language development\nIf your child has frequent ear infections that affect their hearing\u00a0while they're very young, there's a risk their speech and language development may be affected.\nContact your GP for advice if you're concerned about your child's development at any point.\nFacial paralysis\nIn very rare cases, the swelling associated with otitis media can cause the facial nerve to become compressed. The facial nerve is a section of nerve that runs through the skull and is used by the brain to control facial expressions.\nCompression of the nerve can lead to a person being unable to move some or all of their face. This is known as facial paralysis.\nThis can be\u00a0frightening when it first occurs, as many parents are concerned their child may have experienced a stroke.\u00a0However, the condition usually resolves once the underlying infection has passed and rarely causes any long-term problems.\nMeningitis\nA very\u00a0rare and serious complication of a middle ear infection\u00a0is meningitis. This can occur if the infection spreads to the protective outer layer of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges).\nSymptoms of meningitis can include:\n\nsevere headache\nbeing sick\na high temperature (fever)\nstiff neck\nsensitivity to light\nrapid breathing\na blotchy red rash that does not fade or change colour when you place a glass against it (although this is not always present)\n\nIf you think your child may have meningitis, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\nMeningitis caused by a bacterial infection is usually treated in hospital with antibiotics given through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously). Read more about treating meningitis.\nBrain abscess\nAnother very rare and serious complication of\u00a0a middle ear infection\u00a0is a brain abscess. This is a pus-filled swelling that develops inside the brain.\nSymptoms of a brain abscess can\u00a0include:\n\na severe headache\nchanges in mental state, such as confusion\nweakness or\u00a0paralysis on one side of the body\na high temperature (fever)\nseizures (fits)\u00a0\n\nIf you suspect that you or someone you know may have a brain abscess, call 999 for an ambulance.\nA brain abscess is usually treated using a combination of antibiotics and surgery. The surgeon will usually open the skull and drain the pus from the abscess or remove the abscess entirely.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums.\nTumours\u00a0can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common.\nSymptoms of mouth cancer\u00a0include:\n\nred or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue\nulcers\na lump\n\nSpeak to your GP if these symptoms\u00a0do not heal within 3 weeks, especially if you're a heavy drinker or smoker.\nTypes of mouth cancer\nA cancer that develops on the inside or outside layer of the body is called a carcinoma and these types of cancer are categorised by the type of cells the cancer\u00a0starts in.\nSquamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer, accounting for nine out of 10 cases. Squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin.\nLess common types of mouth cancer include:\n\noral malignant melanoma \u2013 where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its colour\nadenocarcinomas \u2013 cancers that develop inside the salivary glands\n\nWhat causes mouth cancer?\nMouth cancer occurs when something goes wrong with the normal cell lifecycle, causing them to grow and reproduce uncontrollably.\nRisk factors\u00a0for developing mouth cancer include:\n\nsmoking or using products that contain tobacco\ndrinking alcohol \u2013 smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large\ninfection with the human papilloma virus (HPV), the virus that causes genital warts\n\nRead more about the causes of mouth cancer\nWho is affected by mouth cancer?\nMouth cancer is an uncommon type of cancer.\nMost cases of mouth cancer first develop in older adults who are aged between 50\u00a0and 74 years old.\nMouth cancer can occur in younger adults, but it's thought that HPV infection may be responsible for the majority of cases that occur in younger people.\nMouth cancer is more common in men than in women. This is thought to be due to the fact that, on average, men drink more alcohol than women.\nTreating mouth cancer\nThere are 3 main treatment options for mouth cancer. They are:\n\nsurgery \u2013 where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue\nchemotherapy \u2013 where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells\nradiotherapy \u2013 where high energy X-rays\u00a0are used to kill cancerous cells\n\nThese treatments are often used in combination. For example, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.\nRead more about treating mouth cancer\nComplications of mouth cancer\nBoth surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult (dysphagia).\nDysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. If small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia.\nRead more about the complications of mouth cancer\nReducing the risk\nThe three most effective ways to prevent mouth cancer from developing \u2013 or prevent it reocurring after successful treatment \u2013 are:\n\nnot smoking\nkeeping to the recommended limits for alcohol consumption\neating a 'Mediterranean-style diet', with plenty of fresh vegetables (particularly tomatoes), citrus fruits, olive oil and fish (read more about healthy eating)\n\nIt's also important that you have regular dental check-ups because dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer.\n\n\nMouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat.\nThe most common symptoms of mouth cancer include:\n\nred or white patches in the mouth or throat\na lump\nulcers\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\npersistent pain in the mouth\npain or difficulty when swallowing (dysphagia)\nchanges in your voice, or speech problems\nswollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck\nunexplained weight loss\nbleeding or numbness in the mouth\na tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason\ndifficulty moving your jaw\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nMany of these symptoms can\u00a0be caused by less serious conditions, such as minor infections.\nBut it's strongly recommended that you visit your GP if any of these symptoms have lasted for more than 3 weeks. It's especially important to seek medical advice if you're a heavy drinker or smoker.\nDental check-ups\nMouth cancer tends not to cause any noticeable symptoms during the initial stages of the disease.\nThis is why it's important to have regular dental check-ups, particularly if you are a smoker, a heavy drinker or a betel chewer, because a dentist may often be able to detect the condition during an examination.\nYou should have a dental check-up at least every year. However, more frequent check-ups may be recommended if you have a history of\u00a0tooth decay or gum disease.\n\n\nThe 2 leading causes of mouth cancer in the UK are drinking too much alcohol and smoking.\nBoth alcohol and tobacco are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to cancer.\nThe risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.\nExactly what triggers the changes in DNA that lead to mouth cancer and why only a small number of people develop mouth cancer is still uncertain.\nHow mouth cancer spreads\nThere are 2 ways mouth cancer can spread:\n\ndirectly \u2013 the cancer can spread out of the mouth and into nearby tissues, such as surrounding skin or into the back of the jaw\nvia the lymphatic system \u2013\u00a0the lymphatic system is a series of glands\u00a0found throughout your body which\u00a0produce many specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection\n\nMouth cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic oral cancer.\nOther risk factors\nOther\u00a0risk factors for mouth cancer may\u00a0include:\n\nchewing tobacco or other smokeless tobacco products like snus\nchewing\u00a0betel nuts with or without tobacco\na poor diet\nthe human papilloma virus (HPV)\npoor oral hygiene\n\nThere is a range of smokeless tobacco products including:\n\nchewing tobacco\nsnuff \u2013 powdered tobacco designed to be snorted\nsnus \u2013 a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip\n\nSmokeless tobacco products are not harmless and may increase your risk of developing mouth cancer, as well as other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and oesophageal cancer.\nBetel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian ethnic communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin.\nThey have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco.\nDue to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large.\nThere is evidence that a poor diet may increase your risk of some types of mouth cancer.\nA healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is thought to reduce your risk of developing mouth cancer.\nThe human papilloma virus (HPV) is a family of viruses that affect the skin and\u00a0moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat.\nYou can contract an HPV infection by having sexual contact with a person already infected \u2013 you do not have to have 'full sex'; just close skin-to-skin contact.\nThere is evidence that in rare cases,\u00a0certain types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth inside the mouth, triggering mouth cancer.\nThere is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having tooth decay, gum disease, not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer.\n\n\nIf you have symptoms of mouth cancer, your GP will carry out a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nIf mouth cancer is suspected, you will be referred to hospital for further tests or to speak to a specialist head and neck surgeon.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of mouth cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected mouth cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nBiopsy\nIt may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. This procedure is known as a biopsy.\nThere are 3 main methods used to carry out a biopsy in cases of suspected mouth cancer.\nA punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth.\nThe area is first injected with a local anaesthetic to numb it. The doctor will then cut away a small section of affected tissue and remove it with tweezers.\nThe procedure is not painful, but can feel a little uncomfortable.\nA fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected\u00a0a swelling in your neck is the result of mouth cancer.\nYour neck is numbed and a\u00a0needle is used\u00a0to draw out a small sample of tissue and fluids from the lump. The sample is then\u00a0checked for cancerous cells.\nFNA is not painful but\u00a0it can be uncomfortable and cause bruising.\nA\u00a0panendoscope is used if the suspected tissue is at the back of your throat or inside one of your nasal cavities.\nThis is a long thin tube\u00a0with a\u00a0camera and a light\u00a0which\u00a0is guided through\u00a0the nose, then used to remove a small section of tissue for the biopsy.\nThe panendoscope can also check whether cancer has spread from your mouth to further down your throat, such as your larynx (voice box), oesophagus (gullet) or trachea (windpipe).\nFurther tests\nIf the biopsy confirms cancer you will need further tests to check what stage it has reached.\nIf the cancer is diagnosed late it can have spread from your mouth into the lymphatic system \u2013 a series of glands throughout your body which produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system.\nOnce the cancer reaches the lymphatic system, it is capable of spreading to any other part of your body, including your bones, blood and organs.\nHowever, it's uncommon for mouth cancer to spread further than the lymph nodes near your mouth, although in some cases it may also spread to surrounding bones, such as the jaw bone, and in some cases your lungs.\nTherefore, the tests will examine your lymph nodes, bones and the tissue near the site of your initial tumour to check for the presence of other tumours.\nThese tests may include:\n\nan\u00a0X-ray\na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \na computerised tomography (CT) scan\na positron emission tomography (PET) scan\n\nFurther biopsies on nearby lymph nodes may also be carried out.\nStaging and grading\nOnce these tests have been completed it should be possible to tell what stage and grade your cancer is:\n\nstaging is a measure of how far the cancer has spread\nthe grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how fast it is likely to spread in future\n\nThis will help determine whether you have:\n\nearly mouth cancer (usually curable)\nintermediate mouth cancer (may be curable)\nor advanced mouth cancer (not usually curable, but it is usually possible to slow the spread of the cancer and extend lifespan)\n\nThere are 3 grades of mouth cancer: low-grade (the slowest), moderate-grade and high-grade (the most aggressive).\nGrading your cancer helps the doctor decide how quickly you need to be treated. Read more about treating mouth cancer.\n\n\nYour treatment will depend on the type and size of the cancer, the grade and how far it's spread \u2013 as well as your general health.\nYour treatment plan\nIf the cancer hasn't spread beyond the mouth or the oropharynx (the bit of your throat at the back of your mouth), a complete cure may be possible using a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nIf the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, then a cure is unlikely but it will be possible to slow the progress of the cancer and help relieve symptoms by using surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your care team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, what are the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nBefore treatment begins\nRadiotherapy makes the teeth more sensitive and vulnerable to infection so before treatment begins, you'll be given a full dental examination and any necessary work will be carried out.\nIf you smoke or drink, stopping will increase the chances of your treatment being successful.\nYour specialist nurse and your GP can provide help and support if you are finding it difficult to quit smoking and drinking.\nRead more about quitting smoking and cutting down on alcohol\nSurgery\nFor mouth cancer, the aim of surgical treatment is to remove any affected tissue while minimising damage to the rest of the mouth.\nIf the cancer is in its very early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumours using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves taking a medicine that makes your tissue sensitive to the effects of light. A laser is then used to remove the tumour.\nIf your cancer is more advanced, it may be necessary to remove part of your mouth lining and, in some cases, facial skin, which can be replaced using skin grafted from your forearm or chest.\nIf your tongue is affected, part of the tongue will have to be removed. This is known as a partial glossectomy. The tongue is then reconstructed using grafted tissue.\nIf the cancer has spread to your jawbone it will need to be surgically removed. The jawbone can be replaced by taking bone from another part of your body and grafting it in place.\nOccasionally, other bones, such as cheekbones, may have to be removed to completely remove the cancer.\nThese can be replaced with plastic prosthetic bones which are usually very realistic, leaving your physical appearance largely unaffected.\nDuring surgery, your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes near the site of the initial tumour. This is often done as a preventative measure in case they contain small numbers of cancerous cells that can't be detected.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy uses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. It may be possible to remove the cancer using radiotherapy alone, but it is usually used after surgery to prevent the cancer from reocurring.\nThe treatment is normally given every day over the course of three to seven weeks, depending on the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.\nWhile it kills cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also affect healthy tissue, and it has a number of side effects, including:\n\nsore, red skin (like sunburn)\nmouth ulcers\u00a0\nsore mouth and throat\ndry mouth\nloss of, or changes in taste\nloss of appetite\ntiredness\u00a0\nfeeling sick\nstiff jaw\nbad breath\u00a0\n\nAny side effects will be monitored by your care team and treated where possible.\nThe side effects of radiotherapy can be distressing, but most of them will pass once the radiotherapy is complete.\nInternal radiotherapy \u2013 also called brachytherapy \u2013 is often used to treat cancers of the tongue that are in their early stages. It involves placing radioactive implants directly into the tumour while you are under a general anaesthetic.\nThey will be left for between 1 and 8 days during which time the cancer cells will receive a much higher dose of radiation than the rest of your mouth.\nVisits by friends and family will need to be restricted due to radiation and pregnant women and children won't be able to visit you.\nThe radioactive implants will cause your mouth to become swollen, and you will experience some pain 5 to 10 days after the implants are removed.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning.\nChemotherapy involves the use of powerful cancer-killing medicines. These medicines damage the DNA of the cancerous cells, interrupting their ability to reproduce.\nMedicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. Adverse side effects are common and include:\n\nfatigue (tiredness)\nsore mouth\nmouth ulcers\nfeeling sick\nbeing sick \nhair loss\ntiredness\n\nThe side effects should stop once the treatment has finished.\nChemotherapy also weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to infection.\nCetuximab\nCetuximab is a new type of medication, known as a biologic, used to treat advanced cases of mouth cancer. It is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy.\nCetuximab targets proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors. These receptors help the cancer to grow, so by targeting these proteins, cetuximab prevents the cancer from spreading.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ruled that cetuximab did not represent a cost-effective treatment in most cases and has recommended it only be used in people who:\n\nare in a good state of health (likely to make a good recovery if treated)\nare unable to have chemotherapy for medical reasons (for example, because they have kidney disease or are pregnant)\n\n\n\nComplications of treatment for mouth cancer can include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), speech problems and emotional disruption.\nDifficulty swallowing\nDysphagia\u00a0is the medical term for difficulty swallowing. It's easy to take your ability to swallow food and liquid\u00a0for granted,\u00a0but in reality, the process relies on a complex interaction of muscles, which can be easily disrupted.\nSurgery and\u00a0radiotherapy can affect your tongue, mouth or throat, resulting in dysphagia. Dysphagia is a potentially serious problem because, aside from the risk of malnutrition, there is a chance that small particles of food could enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs. This can trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia.\u00a0\nIf you are having problems swallowing, a speech and language therapist (SLT) will need to assess your swallowing reflex. One way an SLT can do this is to perform a test known as a videofluoroscopy, which involves adding a special dye to liquid and food that you swallow. The dye highlights your swallowing reflexes and by using X-rays your SLT can see if there is a risk of food entering your lungs.\nIf this is the case, it may be necessary for the short term to provide you with a feeding tube, which will be directly connected to your stomach. The SLT will teach you exercises so you can 'relearn' how to swallow properly.\nYour ability to swallow will improve as you learn the exercises and the damaged tissue is allowed to heal. However, there is a chance your swallowing reflex will never fully recover.\nIn some circumstances, you may have to alter your diet to make swallowing easier. A\u00a0dietitian can give you dietary advice.\nRead more detailed information about how dysphagia is\u00a0treated\nSpeech\nMuch like swallowing, your ability to speak clearly is governed by a complex interaction of muscles, bones and tissue, including your tongue, teeth, lips and soft palate (a section of tissue found at the back of the mouth).\nRadiotherapy and surgery can affect this process and make it difficult to pronounce certain sounds. In severe cases, you may have problems making yourself understood.\nAn SLT will help you improve your verbal communication skills by teaching you a series of exercises that develop your range of vocal movements and teach you new ways of producing sounds.\nEmotional impact\nThe emotional impact of living with mouth cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a roller coaster effect.\nFor example, you may feel down when you receive a diagnosis, but feel up when\u00a0the cancer responds to treatment.\u00a0Then you may feel down again as you try to come to terms with the side effects and after effects of your treatment.\nThis type of emotional disruption can sometimes trigger depression. Signs that you may be depressed include:\n\nfeeling down or hopeless during the past month\nno longer taking pleasure in the things you used to enjoy\n\nContact your GP for advice if you think\u00a0you may be depressed. There are a range of effective treatments for depression, including antidepressant medication and talking therapies, such as\u00a0cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nRead more about\u00a0depression and coping with cancer\n\n\nHaving mouth cancer doesn't necessarily mean you'll have to give up work, but you may need quite a lot of time off, and you may not be able to carry on as you did before treatment.\nIf you have cancer you're covered by the Disability Discrimination Act. This means that your employer is not allowed to discriminate against you because of your illness. They have a duty to make 'reasonable adjustments' to help you cope. Examples of these include:\n\nallowing you time off for treatment and medical appointments\nallowing flexibility with working hours, the tasks you have to perform or your working environment\n\nThe definition of what is 'reasonable' depends on the situation. For example, how much it would affect your employer\u2019s business.\nIt will help if you give your employer as much information as possible about how much time you will need off and when. Talk to your human resources department if you have one. Your union or staff association representative should also be able to give you advice.\nIf you're having difficulties with your employer, you may be able to receive help from your union or your local Citizens Advice Bureau.\nRelationships with others\nIt is not always easy to talk about cancer, either for you or your family and friends. You may sense that some people feel awkward around you or avoid you. Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. Do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.\nMoney and financial support\nIf you have to stop work or go part-time because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support:\n\nif you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\nif you don't have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\nif you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer\u2019s Allowance\nyou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income\n\nFind out as early as possible what help is available to you. Speak to the social worker at your hospital who can give you the information you need.\nTalk to others\nIf you have questions, your GP or nurse may be able to reassure you. You may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information on these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to other people who have mouth cancer, either at a local support group or in an internet chatroom, such as:\n\nCancer Research UK: Cancer chat\u00a0\nMacmillan Cancer Support: Head and neck cancer forum\u00a0\n\nCaring for others with mouth cancer\nBeing a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy and make it easy for you to neglect your own health and mental wellbeing. Research on carers\u2019 health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress.\nIf you are caring for someone else, it is important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It is in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for.\nEat regularly and healthily. If you do not have time to sit down for every meal, try to make time to sit down for at least 1 of your day's meals. Instead of relying on fast food snacks, go for healthier options, such as fruit.\nAs well as exhaustion, isolation and\u00a0worries about the person you are caring for, it is understandable if there are times when you feel resentful and then guilty for feeling like this. These feelings are natural.\nFriends and family may not always understand what you are going through and it can be helpful to talk to people in the same situation.

The pain is\u00a0frequently a persistent dull ache,\u00a0which may be made worse by movement.\nBone fractures and spinal cord compression\nMultiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). The spine and ribs are most often affected.\nFractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back).\nCompression of the spinal cord can cause\u00a0pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels.\nAnaemia\nMultiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells (anaemia). This can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment.\nIf you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless.\nRepeated infections\nPeople with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness).\nYou may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time.\nRaised calcium levels in the blood\nA high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream.\nSymptoms of hypercalcaemia can include extreme thirst, feeling sick, needing to urinate frequently, constipation, confusion and drowsiness.\nUnusual bleeding\nBruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage)\u00a0\u2013 such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and\u00a0heavy periods \u2013 sometimes occurs in multiple myeloma because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood clotting cells called platelets being made.\nThickened blood\nIn some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. This is known as hyperviscosity, which can cause problems such as blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, bleeding from the gums or nose, and shortness of breath.\nKidney problems\nKidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma for several reasons. Abnormal proteins produced by\u00a0the cancer\u00a0cells can damage the kidneys, as can other complications, such as hypercalcaemia. Some medications used to treat multiple myeloma can also\u00a0cause kidney damage.\nEventually, the kidneys may stop working properly. This is known as kidney or renal impairment, or kidney or renal failure. Signs of kidney failure can include:\n\nweight loss\u00a0and poor appetite\nswollen ankles, feet or hands\ntiredness and a lack of energy\nshortness of breath\nitchy skin\nfeeling sick\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should speak to your GP if you have symptoms of multiple myeloma. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.\nYou should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia or kidney failure, as these are medical emergencies that need to be investigated and treated as soon as possible.\nRead more about diagnosing multiple myeloma\u00a0and treating multiple myeloma\n\n\nIn multiple myeloma, cells inside the bone marrow called plasma cells become cancerous.\nBone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body's blood cells.\nPlasma cells are normally produced in\u00a0a controlled way. In cases of multiple myeloma, large numbers of abnormal plasma cells are produced. These fill up the bone marrow and interfere with the production of other cells, such as red and white blood cells.\nThe exact reason why this happens is unknown, but multiple myeloma is closely associated with a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), and there are certain things that can increase your risk of developing it.\nMonoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS)\nIn almost all cases, multiple myeloma occurs in someone who previously had MGUS.\nMGUS is the name for having an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood. This does not cause any symptoms and treatment is not required.\nHowever, every year around\u00a01 in every 100 people with MGUS go on to develop multiple myeloma. There is no known way to delay or prevent this, so\u00a0ongoing outpatient\u00a0tests to check for cancer will usually be recommended if you have MGUS.\nOther factors\nAs well as MGUS, certain things can increase your risk of developing multiple myeloma, including:\n\nage \u2013 your risk of developing multiple myeloma increases as you get older; most cases are diagnosed at around the age of\u00a070, and cases affecting people under 40 are rare\ngender \u2013 men are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than women\nethnicity \u2013 multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations\n\nIt has also been suggested that having a family history of MGUS or multiple myeloma, having reduced immunity (for example, because of medication or HIV), being overweight or obese, and being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals may increase your risk of multiple myeloma. However, a link between these factors and the condition is less clear.\n\n\nMultiple myeloma can be difficult to diagnose because it's an uncommon type of cancer that initially has few or no symptoms.\nYour GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms, medical history and overall health. During the examination, your GP will look for things such as bleeding, signs of infection and specific areas of bone tenderness.\nYou may need urine and\u00a0blood tests to check for certain types of antibodies and proteins (immunoglobulins).\nIf multiple myeloma is suspected,\u00a0you\u00a0will be\u00a0referred to a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the blood) for further tests and\u00a0scans.\nBlood tests\nA number of blood tests are used to help diagnose multiple myeloma, and they may need to be repeated to monitor the condition.\nThese may include:\n\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or plasma viscosity (PV) \u2013\u00a0if you have multiple myeloma, your ESR or PV will usually be raised\ntests to measure the type and number of abnormal antibodies produced by the cancerous plasma cells\na full blood count (FBC) to check levels of different types of blood cells\u00a0\u2013 your doctor will be looking for a low number of red blood cells and platelets\nliver and kidney function\nblood calcium level\n\nUrine tests\nA urine sample will be checked for the abnormal proteins produced by the cancerous plasma cells. The abnormal proteins are known as monoclonal light chains,\u00a0or Bence Jones protein.\nThese proteins can damage your kidneys as they pass through them from your blood to your urine. You may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. This will be used to check the quantity of proteins being produced and how well your kidneys are working.\nX-rays and other scans\nYou will have\u00a0X-rays\u00a0taken of your long bones (arms and legs), skull, spine and pelvis to look for any damage.\nOther scans, such as\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, may also be carried out.\nBone marrow biopsy\nA bone marrow\u00a0biopsy is usually needed to confirm multiple myeloma. A needle will be used to take a small sample of bone marrow from one of your bones, usually the pelvis. A sample of bone may also be removed.\nThis is carried out using a\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0(the area where the needle is inserted is numbed).\nThe sample of bone marrow and bone will be used\u00a0to check for cancerous plasma cells.\n\n\nIf you have multiple myeloma, you will be cared for by a team, which is usually led by a consultant haematologist who specialises in myeloma.\nThe team will discuss your condition and recommend the best treatment for you. However, the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, it may be useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a particular treatment.\nThere are 2 main aims in treating multiple myeloma:\n\nto bring the myeloma under control\nto prevent and treat problems associated with myeloma, such as\u00a0anaemia and bone pain\n\nWhile treatment can often control myeloma and improve quality of life, myeloma usually can't be cured. This means additional treatment is needed when the cancer comes back (a relapse).\nNot everyone diagnosed with myeloma will need immediate treatment if the condition is not causing any problems. This is sometimes referred to as asymptomatic, or smouldering myeloma.\nIf you don't need treatment, you'll be monitored for signs the cancer is beginning to cause problems. If you do need treatment, the following options are most commonly used.\nBringing myeloma under\u00a0control\nThe initial treatment for multiple myeloma may be either:\n\nnon-intensive \u2013 for older or less fit patients (this is more common)\nintensive \u2013 for younger or fitter patients (thought to be too toxic for older or less fit patients)\n\nThe decision about which treatment is appropriate for you is usually based on your biological age or fitness.\nAs a general rule, people younger than 65 are more likely to be candidates for intensive therapy. For those over 70, non-intensive treatment is more likely to be recommended.\nThose aged in between will be given careful consideration as to what treatment group they fall into.\nBoth non-intensive and intensive treatments involve taking a combination of anti-myeloma medicines. Intensive treatment involves much higher doses and is followed by a stem cell transplant.\nThe medicines usually include a chemotherapy medicine, a steroid medicine, and either thalidomide or bortezomib.\nChemotherapy medicines kill the myeloma cells. The most common types used to treat myeloma are melphalan and cyclophosphamide.\nThese treatments are mostly taken in tablet form. They are reasonably well tolerated and side effects are mild. Possible side effects include:\n\nincreased risk of infections\nfeeling sick\nvomiting\nhair loss\n\nYour clinician will give you advice and information about your risk of developing potentially serious infections, and\u00a0tell you what you can do to reduce your risk of picking up infections during your treatment.\nSteroid medications (corticosteroids)\u00a0help destroy myeloma cells and make chemotherapy more effective.\u00a0The 2 most common types used to treat myeloma are dexamethasone and\u00a0prednisolone.\nSteroids are taken orally (by mouth) after eating. Possible side effects include heartburn, indigestion, increased appetite, mood changes and problems falling asleep.\nThalidomide can help kill myeloma cells. You take\u00a0it as a tablet every day, usually\u00a0in the evening\u00a0as it can make you feel sleepy.\nOther common side effects include:\n\nconstipation\u00a0\ndizziness\nrashes\nnumbness or tingling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\n\nThalidomide can cause birth defects, so it should not be taken by pregnant women, and a reliable form of\u00a0contraception such as a condom must be used during treatment.\nThere is also a risk you may develop a blood clot when taking thalidomide, so you may be given medication to help prevent this. Contact your care team immediately if you develop symptoms of a blood clot, such as pain or swelling in one of your legs, or chest pain and breathlessness.\nBortezomib (Velcade) can help kill myeloma cells by causing protein to build-up inside them.\nThere are some limitations as to who can have bortezomib, but a member of your care team will discuss this with you.\nThe medication is given by injection, usually under the skin.\u00a0Possible side effects include:\n\ntiredness\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nnumbness or tingling in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\n\nAfter initial therapy with primarily outpatient-based treatments, people receiving intensive treatment will be given a much higher dose of chemotherapy medication as an inpatient to potentially help destroy a larger number of myeloma cells. This aims to achieve a longer period of remission (where there is no sign of active disease in your body).\nHowever, these high doses also affect healthy bone marrow, so a\u00a0stem cell transplant\u00a0will be needed to help your bone marrow recover.\nIn most cases, the stem cells will be collected from you before treatment (autologous transplantation). In rare cases, they are collected from a sibling or an unrelated donor.\nTreating relapses\nFurther treatment is needed if myeloma returns. Treatment for relapses is generally similar to initial treatment, although non-intensive treatment is often preferred to further intensive treatment.\nAdditional medications such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide and other chemotherapy medicines may be added, or used\u00a0again as your haematologist feels is appropriate.\nYou may also be asked if you want to participate in clinical trial research into\u00a0new treatments for multiple myeloma.\nLenalidomide and pomalidomide are similar to thalidomide. They're both taken by mouth, and both can\u00a0have an effect on the cells produced by your bone marrow, which can cause:\n\nincreased risk of infection \u2013 as\u00a0a result of\u00a0a low number of white blood cells\nanaemia \u2013\u00a0caused by\u00a0a low number of red blood cells\nbruising and bleeding \u2013\u00a0because of\u00a0a low platelet count\n\nThey may also increase your risk of developing a blood clot and have other side effects similar to thalidomide.\nLet your care team know if you experience any problems or unusual symptoms while taking lenalidomide or pomalidomide.\nTreating symptoms and complications of myeloma\nAs well as the main treatments for multiple myeloma, you may also need treatment to help relieve some of the problems caused by the condition.\nFor example:\n\npainkillers \u2013 may be given to reduce pain\nradiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 may be used to relieve bone pain\u00a0or help healing after a bone is surgically repaired\nbisphosphonate medication \u2013 either\u00a0given as tablets or by injection, this may\u00a0help prevent bone damage and reduce the levels of calcium in your blood\nblood transfusions or\u00a0erythropoietin medication \u2013 may be used\u00a0to increase your red blood cell count and\u00a0treat anaemia\nsurgery \u2013 may be carried out\u00a0to repair or strengthen damaged bones, or treat compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back)\ndialysis\u00a0\u2013 may be\u00a0required if you develop kidney failure\nplasma exchange\u00a0\u2013 treatment to remove and replace a blood component called plasma may be carried out if you have unusually thick blood (hyperviscosity)\n\nThese treatments can each cause side effects and complications, so make sure you discuss the potential risks and benefits with your treatment team beforehand.\nClinical trials and research\nResearch is ongoing to find new treatments for multiple myeloma and work out ways to improve the use of existing ones. To help with this, you may be asked to take part in a clinical trial\u00a0during your treatment.\nClinical trials usually involve comparing a new treatment with an existing one to see whether the new treatment is more or less effective.\nIt's important to remember, however, that if you are given a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing treatment.\nThere will never be any pressure for you to take part in a trial if you do not want to.\nSearch clinical trials for multiple myeloma\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Mumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine.\nIt\u2019s most recognisable by the painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive \"hamster face\" appearance.\nOther\u00a0symptoms of mumps\u00a0include headaches, joint pain and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands.\nWhen to see your GP\nIt's important to contact your GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made.\u00a0While\u00a0mumps isn't usually serious,\u00a0the condition\u00a0has similar symptoms to\u00a0more serious types of infection, such as\u00a0glandular fever and tonsillitis.\nYour GP can usually make a diagnosis\u00a0after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth\u00a0and checking the person's temperature to see if it's higher than normal.\nLet your GP know in advance if you're coming to the surgery, so they\u00a0can take any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection.\nIf your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection unit (HPU). The HPU will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.\nWho is affected\nMost cases of mumps occur in people between 17 and 34 years of age who have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. There were 534 confirmed mumps cases of mumps in Scotland between 1 January and 30 September 2019.\nOnce you've been infected by the mumps virus, you normally develop a life-long immunity to further infection.\nHow mumps is spread\nMumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu \u2013 through infected droplets of saliva\u00a0that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.\u00a0\u00a0\nA person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards.\nDuring this time, it's important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who haven't been vaccinated.\nIf you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by:\n\nregularly washing your hands with soap\nusing and disposing of tissues when you sneeze\navoiding school or work for at least five days after your symptoms first develop\n\nPreventing mumps\nYou can protect your child against mumps by making sure they're given the combined\u00a0MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella).\u00a0The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS\u00a0childhood immunisation schedule.\u00a0\nYour child should be given one dose when they are around 12-13 months and a second booster dose before they start school.\u00a0Your child needs to get 2 doses of the vaccine to provide the best protection against mumps.\nTreatment for mumps\nThere's currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within one or two weeks.\nTreatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes:\n\ngetting plenty of bed rest and fluids\nusing painkillers, such as ibuprofen\u00a0and paracetamol\u00a0\u2013 aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16\napplying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain\n\nRead more about treating mumps\nComplications\nMumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person's health.\u00a0Serious complications are rare.\nHowever, mumps can lead to viral\u00a0meningitis if the\u00a0virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males\u00a0or the ovaries in females (if the affected male or female has\u00a0gone through puberty).\nRead more about the complications of mumps\n\n\nThe symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after becoming infected with the mumps virus (this delay is known as the incubation period). The average incubation period is around 17 days.\nSwelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. The parotid glands are a pair of glands responsible for producing saliva. They're located in either side of your face, just below your ears.\nBoth glands are usually affected by the swelling, although only one gland can be affected. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness and\u00a0difficulty with swallowing.\nMore general symptoms often develop a few days before the parotid glands swell. These can include:\n\nheadache\njoint pain\nfeeling sick\ndry mouth\nmild abdominal pain\nfeeling tired\nloss of appetite\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F), or above\n\nIn about\u00a0one in\u00a0three cases, mumps doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you suspect mumps, it's important to call your GP.\nWhile the infection isn't usually serious, mumps\u00a0has similar\u00a0symptoms to other, more serious types of infection, such as\u00a0glandular fever and tonsillitis. It's always best to visit your GP so they can confirm (or rule out) a diagnosis of mumps.\nIt's also important to let\u00a0your GP\u00a0know in advance if\u00a0you're coming to the surgery\u00a0so they can take any necessary precautions to avoid the spread of infection.\n\n\nMumps is caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to a family of viruses known as paramyxoviruses. These viruses are a common source of infection, particularly in children.\nWhen you get mumps, the virus moves from your respiratory tract (your nose, mouth and throat) into your parotid glands (saliva-producing glands found either side of your face), where it begins to reproduce. This causes the glands to swell.\nThe virus can also enter your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spine. Once the virus has entered the CSF, it can spread to other parts of your body, such as your brain, pancreas, testicles (in boys and men) and ovaries (in girls and women).\nHow mumps is spread\nMumps is an airborne virus and can be spread by:\n\nan infected person coughing or sneezing and releasing tiny droplets of contaminated saliva, which can then be breathed in by another person\nan infected person touching their nose or mouth, then transferring the virus onto an object, such as a door handle, or work surface; if someone else touches the object shortly afterwards, they can transfer the virus into their respiratory tract\nsharing utensils, such as cups, cutlery or plates with an infected person\n\nPeople with mumps are usually most infectious\u00a0from a few days before their parotid glands swell until a few days afterwards. For this reason, it's advisable to avoid work or school for five days after your symptoms\u00a0first develop\u00a0if you're diagnosed with mumps.\nMumps\u00a0can also be passed on by people who are infected with\u00a0the virus\u00a0but don't have any obvious symptoms.\n\n\nIf you suspect that you or your child has mumps, it's important to\u00a0see your GP\u00a0for a diagnosis.\nLet your GP know in advance of your surgery visit so\u00a0any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection can be taken.\nMumps\u00a0can usually be\u00a0diagnosed from the symptoms, in particular\u00a0the swelling of\u00a0glands in the sides of your face (parotid glands).\nIf you have mumps, your GP can see and feel the swelling. By looking inside your mouth, they may be able to see that your tonsils have been pushed out of their usual position.\nYour GP can also check your temperature to see if it is higher than normal.\nIf your GP suspects mumps, they should notify\u00a0your local health protection unit (HPU). The HPU will arrange for a sample of your saliva to be tested to confirm\u00a0or rule out\u00a0the diagnosis.\nRead about treating mumps.\n\n\nTreatment for mumps is focused on relieving symptoms until your body\u2019s immune system fights off the infection. There are currently no medications to treat the mumps virus.\nThe infection usually passes within\u00a0a week or two.\nIn the meantime, the measures below may help.\n\nget plenty of bed rest until your symptoms have passed\ntake over-the-counter painkillers, such as\u00a0ibuprofen or paracetamol, to relieve any pain (children\u00a0aged 16 or under should not be given aspirin)\ndrink plenty of fluids, but avoid acidic drinks such as fruit juice as these can irritate your parotid glands; water is usually the best fluid to drink\napply a warm or cool compress to your swollen glands\u00a0to help reduce\u00a0any pain\neat foods that don't require a lot of chewing, such as soup, mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs\n\nIf your symptoms don\u2019t improve after seven days, or\u00a0suddenly worsen,\u00a0contact your GP for advice.\nPreventing the spread of infection\nIf you or your child has mumps, it\u2019s important to prevent the infection spreading, particularly\u00a0to younger people born between 1980\u00a0and 1990 (these people are unlikely to have immunity from a previous infection, and are also unlikely to have been vaccinated).\nThe best way to do this is to:\n\nstay away from school, college or work until five days after\u00a0you first developed symptoms\nwash your hands regularly, using soap and water\nalways use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze, and throw the tissue in a bin immediately afterwards\n\n\n\nThere are several problems that often occur with mumps. These can be worrying, but they're rarely serious and usually improve as the infection passes.\nCommon complications\nPain and swelling of the testicle (orchitis) affects one in\u00a0four males who get mumps after puberty.\u00a0The swelling is usually sudden and affects only one testicle. The testicle may also feel warm and tender.\nIn affected boys and men, swelling of the testicle\u00a0normally begins\u00a0four to eight\u00a0days after the swelling of the parotid gland.\u00a0Occasionally, swelling can occur up to six weeks after the swelling of the glands.\nAny\u00a0testicle pain\u00a0can be eased using over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol\u00a0or ibuprofen. If the pain is particularly severe, contact your GP, who may prescribe a stronger painkiller for you.\nApplying cold or warm compresses to your testicle and wearing supportive underwear may also reduce any pain.\nJust under half of all males who get mumps-related orchitis notice some shrinkage of their testicles and an estimated 1 in 10 men experience a drop in their sperm count (the amount of healthy sperm their body can produce). However, this is very rarely large enough to cause infertility.\nOne in 20 females who get mumps after puberty experience swelling of the ovaries (oophoritis), which can cause:\n\nlower abdominal pain\nhigh temperature\nbeing sick\n\nThe symptoms of oophoritis usually pass once the body has fought off the underlying mumps infection.\nViral\u00a0meningitis can occur if the mumps virus spreads into the outer protective layer of the brain (the meninges). It occurs in about\u00a0one in\u00a0seven cases of mumps.\nUnlike bacterial meningitis, which is regarded as a potentially life-threatening medical emergency, viral meningitis causes milder, flu-like symptoms, and the risk of serious complications is low.\nSensitivity to light, neck stiffness\u00a0and\u00a0headaches are common symptoms of viral meningitis. These usually pass within 14 days.\nAbout 1 in 20 cases of mumps lead to short-term inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis). The most common symptom is sudden pain in the centre of your belly. Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:\n\nfeeling or being sick\ndiarrhoea\nloss of appetite\nhigh temperature\ntenderness of the belly\nless commonly, yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n\nAlthough pancreatitis associated with mumps is usually mild, you may be admitted to hospital so your body functions can be supported until your pancreas recovers.\nRare complications of mumps\nRare but potentially serious complications of mumps include an infection of the brain itself, known as encephalitis. This is\u00a0thought to occur in around 1 in 1,000 people who develop viral meningitis from mumps. Encephalitis is a potentially fatal condition that requires admission to a hospital\u00a0intensive care unit. About 1 in 20 people with mumps experience some temporary\u00a0hearing loss, but permanent loss of hearing\u00a0is rare. It's estimated\u00a0this occurs in around 1 in 20,000 cases of mumps.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is a rare disorder that affects the inner ear.

The unpredictable nature of the attacks and the restrictions this can place on your activities can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression.\nYour GP can offer advice and support if you're finding it difficult to cope with the effect M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is having on your life. There are also a number of support groups, that could provide assistance and advice.\nRead more about living with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\nInformation about you\nIf you have\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register\n\n\nThe symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease vary from person to person. They often begin as sudden attacks, lasting for a few hours. Some people may experience several attacks each week or they may be separated by weeks, months or even years.\nSee your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, so they can try to identify the problem and refer you to a specialist, if necessary.\nMain symptoms\nThe main symptoms of\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease are:\n\nvertigo \u2013 the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning\ntinnitus \u2013\u00a0hearing sounds from inside\u00a0your body, rather than from an outside source\nhearing loss, with a particular difficulty hearing deep or low sounds\na sense of pressure or fullness\u00a0deep inside the\u00a0ear\n\nThese symptoms\u00a0usually only affect one ear at first, but both ears\u00a0often become affected over time.\nVertigo and tinnitus are described in more detail below.\nVertigo\u00a0is one of the most common and noticeable symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\u00a0\nAs well as a sensation of spinning, you may also experience additional symptoms during an attack of vertigo, such as dizziness, feeling or being sick, and problems with balance. You may have difficulty standing or walking. Occasionally, you may have \"drop attacks\", where you suddenly fall to the ground.\nDuring a severe attack,\u00a0you may\u00a0also experience sweating, diarrhoea and rapid or irregular heartbeats.\nTinnitus is usually more noticeable when you're tired or when it's quiet, as there's less background noise to distract you from sounds coming from inside your body.\nExamples of\u00a0sounds you may hear include buzzing, humming, grinding, hissing and whistling.\nStages of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is often\u00a0divided into early, middle and late stages.\nHowever, the progression of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease varies between individuals. You may not necessarily pass through each of these stages and the severity of the symptoms may also vary. In general, people experience more attacks during the first few years, and then as the attacks decrease in frequency over time, the hearing loss becomes progressively worse.\nSome or all of the following\u00a0symptoms may be experienced before an attack:\n\nloss of balance\u00a0\ndizziness and lightheadedness\nheadache and increased ear pressure\nincreased hearing loss or tinnitus\nsensitivity to sound\na feeling of uneasiness\n\nIf a person is aware of these warning symptoms, it can allow\u00a0them to move to a safer or more comfortable situation before an attack.\nThe stages of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease are described in more detail below.\nThe early stage of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease consists of sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo. These are usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness. You may lose some hearing during the attack, and\u00a0you may experience\u00a0tinnitus at the same time. Your ear may also feel blocked and uncomfortable, with a sense of fullness. Some people may also experience sensitivity to sound.\nAttacks of vertigo at this stage can last from 20 minutes to 24 hours, but usually last around two to three hours. Your hearing and the full sensation in your ear usually returns to normal between attacks.\nThe middle stage of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease consists of continuing attacks of vertigo, with the attacks becoming less severe for some people. However, tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse.\nDuring the middle stage, you may experience some periods of remission (where your symptoms go away), which can last for up to several months. Some people may still experience symptoms of tinnitus, sensitivity to sound or loss of balance between attacks of vertigo.\nDuring the late stage of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, the episodes of vertigo occur far less frequently. There may be months or even several years between attacks or\u00a0they may stop altogether. However, you may be left with balance problems, and you may be unsteady on your feet, particularly in the dark.\nHearing problems and tinnitus\u00a0tend to\u00a0become progressively worse during the late stage of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\n\n\nThe exact cause of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease isn't clear, although it's thought to be caused by a problem with the pressure in the inner ear.\nThe inner ear is made up of:\n\nthe cochlea \u2013 a coiled, spiral tube that contains two fluid-filled chambers and is responsible for hearing\nthe vestibular apparatus \u2013 a complex set of tubes that help to control balance\n\nThe fluid inside the inner ear is called endolymph.\nIf the pressure of the endolymph fluid changes \u2013 for example, because there is too much fluid \u2013 it can result in symptoms such as vertigo and tinnitus.\nIt's thought that this pressure change is responsible for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, although it hasn't been proven.\nIncreased\u00a0risk\nAlthough the exact cause of\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is unknown, the following factors may increase the risk of developing the condition:\n\nautoimmunity \u2013 when your immune system attacks your own tissues and organs by mistake\ngenetic (inherited) factors \u2013 for example, if you have a family history of the condition\na chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear\u00a0\u2013 as a result of too little or too much sodium or potassium in your body\na problem with the blood vessels \u2013 there's a link between M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and migraines, which are thought to be caused by the narrowing and widening of blood vessels\nsome viral infections \u2013 such as meningitis\n\n\n\nThere's no single test for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and the condition can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions with similar symptoms.\nFor example,\u00a0migraines and ear infections can also affect your balance and hearing. A viral infection of the balance nerve (vestibular neuronitis) or the inner ear (labyrinthitis) can also produce similar vertigo attacks.\nSeeing your GP\nSee your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\nThey'll ask you to describe your symptoms to find out if a pattern is emerging\u00a0that\u00a0could indicate M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\nFor M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease to be diagnosed, you'll need to have the following characteristic symptoms:\n\nvertigo (a feeling that the environment around you is spinning) \u2013 at least two episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes or more within a single M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease attack\nhearing loss \u2013 tests must confirm that hearing loss is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea (the coiled tube in the inner ear)\ntinnitus (hearing noises from within your body) or a feeling of pressure in your ear\n\nYour GP\u00a0may also carry out a general physical examination to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. This may involve listening to your heartbeat, checking your blood pressure and examining the inside of your ears.\nSeeing a specialist\nIf necessary, your GP can refer you to a specialist for further tests.\nIn most cases, you'll probably be referred to an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist at the ENT department of your local hospital.\nYou can also\u00a0be referred to a specialist in audiovestibular medicine for hearing and balance assessment, although this service may not be available in every hospital.\nThe specialist will be able to assess the extent of your hearing loss by using hearing tests, such as an audiometry test.\nDuring an audiometry test, you listen to sounds of different volume and pitch produced by a machine and signal when you hear a sound, either by raising your hand or pressing a button.\nRead more about how hearing tests are carried out\nVideonystagmography (VNG) may be used to check for signs of uncontrollable eye movements (nystagmus) because this can indicate a problem with balance.\nDuring this test, special goggles are placed over your eyes and you'll be asked to look at various still and moving targets. The goggles are fitted with a video camera to record your eye movements.\nA caloric\u00a0test involves putting warm and cool water or air in your ear for about 30 seconds. The change in temperature stimulates the balance organ in the ear, allowing the specialist to check how well it's working.\nThis test isn't painful, although it's normal to feel dizzy for a few minutes afterwards.\nElectrocochleography is\u00a0a test used to measure how your hearing nerves respond to sound.\nDuring\u00a0this test, a series of electrodes\u00a0are attached to your head and\u00a0a thin probe or\u00a0needle\u00a0is\u00a0passed into your ear so it touches or passes through\u00a0your eardrum. Local anaesthetic will be used to numb your eardrum before the procedure if a needle is going to be passed through it.\nYou will then listen to a series\u00a0of\u00a0loud clicks, while the activity of your nerves is picked up by the electrodes and probe or needle.\nIn some cases, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your head may be carried out to look for any abnormalities in your brain \u2013 such as an acoustic neuroma (a non-cancerous tumour) \u2013 that could be causing your symptoms.\n\n\nTreatment can usually help to control the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, although there's currently no cure.\nYour ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist and your GP can help you manage your symptoms. Possible treatments include:\n\ndietary advice\u00a0\u2013 particularly a low-salt diet\nmedication to treat and prevent attacks\ntreatment for tinnitus\u00a0\ntreatment for hearing loss\ntreatment called vestibular rehabilitation to cope with balance problems\ntreatment for stress, anxiety and depression\nsurgery\n\nYour GP and ENT specialist should provide you with advice tailored to your individual needs, and should develop a plan to\u00a0help you manage your symptoms.\nIn some cases, the treatment available may depend on what your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) can provide.\nTreatment during an attack\nDuring an attack of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, you may be prescribed medication to treat the symptoms of vertigo, nausea and vomiting.\nThis is\u00a0usually\u00a0prochlorperazine or an antihistamine. If these work, you may be given a supply to keep, so you can take them quickly during an attack.\nProchlorperazine can cause side effects including tremors (shaking) and involuntary body or facial movements. It can also make some people feel sleepy.\nCheck the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects, or read more about prochlorperazine.\nIf you experience vomiting during your attacks, you can take a type of prochlorperazine called Buccastem. This comes as a tablet that you place between your gums and your cheek, on the inside of your mouth. The tablet dissolves and is absorbed into your body.\nAntihistamines you may be prescribed include cinnarizine, cyclizine\u00a0and promethazine teoclate.\nAntihistamines can make you feel sleepy. Headaches and an upset stomach are also possible side effects. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects.\nDuring an attack, take your medication as soon as possible and grab the nearest available support. Get into a position in which you feel most stable or comfortable, and keep as still as possible. If you need to move, do so slowly and carefully. Close your eyes or keep them fixed on objects in front of you, and don't turn your head quickly.\nOnce your symptoms start to improve, it's best to gradually try to move around, as this encourages your brain to use your vision and other senses to compensate for the problems in your inner ear.\nIf you suffer severe vertigo, dizziness, nausea and vomiting during an attack of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, you may need to be injected with prochlorperazine by your doctor.\nIf you suffer severe vertigo with or without nausea during an attack, your doctor may also prescribe you a tablet of Buccastem that dissolves very quickly in your mouth (see above).\nIn\u00a0particularly severe cases, you may need to be admitted to hospital to receive intravenous fluids (through a vein) to keep you hydrated.\nPreventing attacks\nYour GP can prescribe a medication called betahistine to help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, or you may be advised to change your diet.\nAlthough it has not been proven to be consistently effective, following a diet without added salt can help some people to control their symptoms. It's possible that this type of diet might alter the fluids in your inner ear.\nAvoiding excessive caffeine, found in drinks such as tea and coffee, is also usually recommended.\nBetahistine\nBetahistine is thought to\u00a0reduce the pressure of the fluid in your inner ear, relieving the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Your GP may recommend trying them to see if they help.\nBetahistines are usually available as tablets to be taken three times a day. Your GP will discuss how long you need to take them for, which could be a few weeks, or up to a year. Possible side effects include a headache, upset stomach and a rash.\nTreating tinnitus\nA\u00a0number of different treatments can be used to treat tinnitus caused by M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Some possibilities include:\n\nSound therapy \u2013 the effects of tinnitus are often more pronounced in quiet environments. The aim of sound therapy is to fill the silence with neutral, often repetitive sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus.\nRelaxation techniques \u2013 tinnitus can be a distressing and intrusive condition. Relaxing by practising yoga or special breathing techniques may help you to avoid stress and anxiety.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 this is a therapy based on the knowledge that M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's symptoms can have a significant psychological effect, resulting in negative thoughts and changes in behaviour. This\u00a0may aggravate your symptoms and create a vicious circle. CBT is given by a specially trained professional who aims to change the way you think and behave, to break this cycle.\n\nRead more about treating tinnitus\nTreating hearing loss\nYou may experience permanent hearing loss if M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is in the middle or end stages. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease tends to make you more sensitive to loud sounds, and also makes it more difficult for you to distinguish low-pitched sounds.\nThere are a variety of hearing aids available. Hearing therapists and organisations, such as Action on Hearing Loss, can provide you with helpful advice for dealing with hearing loss.\nRead more about treating hearing loss\nVestibular rehabilitation\nVestibular rehabilitation (VRT) is usually provided by a hearing specialist or physiotherapist. Your GP may be able to refer you for VRT, although it will depend on the\u00a0availability in your area.\nA vestibular therapist or specially trained physiotherapist can help improve your balance by teaching you vestibular rehabilitation techniques. These exercises teach you how to cope with the disorientating signals coming from your inner ear. You're taught to use alternative signals from your eyes, ankles, legs and neck, to keep you balanced.\nVestibular therapy is usually used in the middle or late stages of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, after the severe attacks of vertigo have stopped, but when balance problems may remain.\nIn some cases, it may be possible to use VRT without specialist help. Research has shown that some people can improve their symptoms by using self-help VRT booklets. However, you should discuss this with your doctor first.\u00a0\nSurgery\nIn severe cases, surgery can be performed to control the attacks of vertigo. However, surgical procedures are usually only used if other treatments have failed.\nThe type of surgery you have will depend on your symptoms, and whether both ears are affected. You could have:\n\nnon-destructive surgery\nselectively destructive surgery\ndestructive surgery\n\nNon-destructive surgery may be used if your hearing in the affected ear is \"socially adequate\" (you can hear sounds that are below 50 decibels). This type of surgery aims to change the progression of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease by reducing the severity and frequency of your symptoms.\nTypes of non-destructive surgery include:\n\nendolymphatic sac decompression \u2013 this can help to reduce the pressure in your inner ear by increasing the drainage of the fluid of your inner ear\ninjecting steroid medication through the eardrum\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information on micropressure therapy for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\nIn selectively destructive surgery, the balance part of the inner ear is destroyed with a medicine called gentamicin. This is injected through the ear drum (the thin layer of tissue separating the outer ear from the middle ear) and enters the labyrinth (the system of tubes in the inner ear).\nGentamicin should mainly damage the balance part of your ear, but there's a risk it could damage your hearing as well.\nSome surgeons prefer to apply the gentamicin directly to the inner ear during a minor operation. This means they can control the exact dose of gentamicin that enters your ear.\nDestructive surgery may be considered if only one ear is affected by M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. The hearing in the affected ear must be considered to be \"socially inadequate\" (you can't hear enough to function in social situations). As an approximate guide, if you can't hear sounds below 50 decibels, this may count as socially inadequate.\nDestructive surgery is used to destroy the part of your inner ear causing your vertigo attacks. However, these operations can cause permanent hearing loss in the treated ear, so will only be considered if you already have permanently reduced hearing in the affected ear.\nDestructive surgery can\u00a0be done by:\n\ndestroying the balance part of your audio-vestibular nerve \u2013 the nerve transmitting sounds and balance information to the brain\ndestroying part of your vestibular labyrinth (labyrinthectomy) \u2013 the system of tiny, fluid-filled channels in the ear\n\nAfter surgery, your other ear will take over your hearing and balance functions.\nThere are very few clinical trials looking into the effectiveness of surgery for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, which is why surgery is rarely considered. If your ENT specialist thinks you may benefit from having surgery, they'll discuss the procedure and any risks in more detail with you.\nSupport groups and charities\nThere are several support groups and charities that can provide you with useful information and advice about living with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. They can also put you in touch with other people with the condition.\nSee living with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease for more information\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and the placebo effect\nThe placebo effect is the unusual psychological effect that can occur when a person is given a \"dummy\" medication, such as a sugar pill. They feel better after taking the pill, because they think they're being given real medication.\nAlthough there's limited scientific evidence to suggest that many of the self-help measures and treatments used for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease are consistently effective, they can help some people to control their symptoms because of the placebo effect.\n\n\nLiving with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease can be difficult and frustrating. Your balance and hearing may be significantly impaired during an attack, meaning that certain activities can be dangerous.\nThe unpredictable nature of the condition means you may need to change your daily activities so you don't place yourself, or others, in danger. Situations you may need to avoid include:\n\nswimming\nclimbing ladders or scaffolding\noperating heavy machinery\ndriving (see below)\n\nYou may also need to make sure that someone is with you most of the time, in case you need help during an attack.\nThese\u00a0restrictions\u00a0may leave you feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed. Speak to your GP if you're finding it difficult to come to terms with the effect that M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is having on your life.\u00a0They can\u00a0offer advice and support.\nSupport groups and charities\nThere are also several support groups and charities that provide useful information and advice about living with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. They can put you in touch with other people who have the condition, so you can share experiences and provide support to one another.\nAs the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease can affect your work and family life, you may need advice on financial and relationship issues. The Citizens Advice Bureau and GOV.UK may be useful.\nIf you're caring for someone with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, you can find relevant information, advice and help by visiting Care Information Scotland.\nDriving\nIf you experience sudden episodes of\u00a0vertigo and dizziness, you must inform the\u00a0Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about your condition before driving.\nYou'll need to fill in a form about your condition and the DVLA will ask for permission to obtain reports on your condition from your doctor or specialist.\nYour case will be assessed on an individual basis, but it's likely that you won't be allowed to continue driving if you experience sudden attacks of vertigo and dizziness\u00a0without any warning signs.\nDriving won't be permitted again until you have control of your symptoms, in which case you'll need to reapply for a licence. Your GP or ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist will have to confirm your symptoms have improved and are under control.\nIf you drive a heavy goods vehicle or a passenger-carrying vehicle and you're diagnosed with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, you usually have to be symptom-free for a year before you can reapply for a licence.\nVisit GOV.UK for more information about driving with a disability or health condition\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.\nThe lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.\nIn non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.\nThe most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.\nRead more about the symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\u00a0\nWho's affected?\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with most cases diagnosed in people over 65.

However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if you:\n\nhave a medical condition that weakens your immune system\ntake immunosuppressant medication\nhave previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which causes glandular fever\n\nYou also have a slightly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had the condition.\nRead more about the causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHow non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed\nThe only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy.\nThis is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.\nRead more about diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nTreatment and outlook\nThere are many subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they can generally be put into one of 2 broad categories:\n\nhigh-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2013 where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively\nlow-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2013 where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years\n\nThe outlook\u00a0for non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type,\u00a0grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person\u2019s age.\nLow-grade tumours don't necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.\u00a0\nThe main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are:\n\nchemotherapy\nradiotherapy\u00a0\na\u00a0type of targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy\n\nOverall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable. You can read more detailed information about\u00a0the outlook for non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the Cancer Research UK website.\nHowever, there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.\nRead more about:\u00a0\n\ntreating non-Hodgkin lymphoma\u00a0\ncomplications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n\nInformation about you\nIf you have\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

They\u00a0contain white blood cells that help to fight against infection.\nThe swelling is caused by a certain type of white blood cell,\u00a0known as\u00a0lymphocytes,\u00a0collecting in\u00a0the lymph node.\nHowever, it's highly unlikely you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma if you have swollen lymph nodes, as these glands often swell as a response to infection.\nOther symptoms\nSome people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include:\n\nnight sweats\nunintentional weight loss\u00a0\na high temperature (fever)\na persistent\u00a0cough or feeling of\u00a0breathlessness\npersistent itching of the skin all over the body\n\nOther symptoms depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have abdominal pain or indigestion.\nA few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they're diagnosed. This may lead to:\n\npersistent tiredness or fatigue\nan increased risk of infections\nexcessive bleeding \u2013 such as nosebleeds,\u00a0heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSpeak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.\nWhile the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it's best to get them checked out.\n\n\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. The exact reason why this happens isn't known.\nDNA gives cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions, so the cells keep growing. This causes them to multiply uncontrollably.\nThe abnormal\u00a0lymphocytes\u00a0usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it's possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your:\n\nbone marrow\nspleen\nliver\nskin\nlungs\n\nHowever, in some cases, non-Hodgkin lymphoma first develops in an organ or\u00a0somewhere else outside the lymphatic system (the network of lymph vessels and glands found throughout\u00a0the body).\nWho's most at risk?\nWhile the cause of the initial mutation that triggers non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:\n\nhaving a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV\nhaving medical treatment that weakens your immune system \u2013 for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after an organ transplant\nhaving an autoimmune condition (a condition caused by problems with the immune system), such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome\nbeing previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 a common virus that causes glandular fever\nbeing previously exposed to the Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)\nhaving a Helicobacter pylori infection \u2013 a common bacterial infection that usually infects the lining of the stomach and small intestine\nhaving received chemotherapy or radiotherapy for an earlier cancer\nhaving\u00a0coeliac disease \u2013 an adverse reaction to gluten that causes inflammation of the small bowel\n\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma isn't infectious and isn't thought to run in families, although your risk may be slightly increased if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had lymphoma.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but most cases are diagnosed in people over 65. The condition is slightly more common in men than women.\n\n\nIf you see your GP because you're concerned about symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, they'll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination.\nIf necessary, your GP will refer you to hospital for further tests.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nIf you're referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nBiopsy\nA biopsy involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory.\nBiopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a local anaesthetic\u00a0(where the area is numbed). In some cases,\u00a0the affected lymph node isn't easily accessible and a general anaesthetic may be required (where you're asleep).\nA pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. If they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment.\nTypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nThere are more than 30 types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including:\n\ndiffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nfollicular lymphoma\nextranodal marginal zone B-cell (MALT)\nmantle cell lymphoma\nBurkitt lymphoma\nmediastinal large B-cell lymphoma\nnodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma\nsmall lymphocytic lymphoma\nlymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\u00a0\nperipheral T-cell lymphoma\nskin (cutaneous) lymphomas\nanaplastic large-cell lymphoma\nlymphoblastic lymphoma\n\nThe Macmillan Cancer Support website has more detailed information on the different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nFurther testing\nIf a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be required to check how far the lymphoma has spread. This allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma.\nFurther tests may include:\n\nblood tests \u2013 samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidney are working\nbone marrow sample \u2013 another biopsy may be carried out to see if the lymphoma has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic\nchest X-ray\u00a0\u2013 this can check whether\u00a0the cancer\u00a0has spread to your chest or lungs\ncomputerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of\u00a0the cancer\u00a0\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u2013 this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body to check the spread of the cancer\npositron emission tomography (PET) scan \u2013\u00a0this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and\u00a0can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment; it's usually taken at the same time as a CT scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are working\nlumbar puncture\u00a0\u2013 using a thin needle, a sample of spinal fluid is taken and examined to see if it contains any lymphoma cells\n\nStages of\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nWhen the testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. 'Staging' means scoring the cancer by how far it's spread.\nThe main stages of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are.\n\nstage 1\u00a0\u2013 the cancer is limited to 1 group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs)\nstage 2 \u2013 2 or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below\u00a0the diaphragm\nstage 3\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm\nstage 4\u00a0\u2013 the lymphoma has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow\n\nHealth professionals also add the letter 'A' or 'B' to your stage to indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms.\n'A'\u00a0is put after your stage if you have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. 'B' is put after your stage if you have additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats.\nIn some cases, health professionals also use additional letters to indicate where the cancer first developed. For example, 'E' (extranodal) means the cancer developed outside the lymphatic system.\nGrading non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nTesting can also help health professionals decide the 'grade' of the cancer. There are two main grades of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:\n\nlow-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years\nhigh-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively\n\nLow-grade tumours don't necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated immediately, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.\nIn some cases, low-grade lymphomas can develop into high-grade lymphomas over time.\nRead more about treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is usually treated with cancer-killing medication or radiotherapy, although some people may not need treatment straight away.\nIn a few cases,\u00a0if the initial cancer is\u00a0very small\u00a0and can be removed during\u00a0a\u00a0biopsy, no further treatment may be needed.\nYour treatment plan\nThe recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age,\u00a0as many of the treatments can put a\u00a0tremendous strain on the body.\nDiscussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\nYour MDT will recommend the best treatment options for you. However, you shouldn't be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner.\nYou'll be invited back to see your care team for a full discussion about the risks and benefits of any treatments planned before treatment begins.\nYou can ask your\u00a0care team\u00a0if a clinical trial\u00a0is available to take part in.\nWait-and-see approach\nIf the disease is low-grade (slow developing) and you're well, a period of 'watchful waiting' is often recommended. This is because some people take many years to develop troublesome symptoms and starting treatment immediately is often felt to be unnecessary.\nIf watchful waiting is recommended, you'll be seen regularly for reviews and invited to come back at any stage if you feel your symptoms are getting worse.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0is a widely used treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which involves\u00a0using medicine to kill cancer cells. It may be used on\u00a0its own, combined with biological therapy and/or combined with radiotherapy (see below).\nThe medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer.\nIf doctors think your cancer is curable, you'll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy).\u00a0If a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms.\nIf there's a risk of the cancer spreading to your brain, you may have chemotherapy injections directly into the cerebrospinal fluid around your spine.\nChemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight. However, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome, and a longer hospital stay may be needed.\nChemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems:\n\nfatigue\nbreathlessness\nincreased vulnerability to infection\nbleeding and bruising more easily\n\nIf you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells.\nOther possible side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\nnausea and vomiting\ndiarrhoea\nloss of appetite\nmouth ulcers\ntiredness\nskin rashes\nhair loss\ninfertility, which may be temporary or permanent (see complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma for more information)\n\nMost side effects should pass once your treatment has finished. Tell your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments that can help.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nIf non-Hodgkin lymphoma doesn't get better with initial treatment (known as 'refractory' lymphoma), you may have a course of chemotherapy at a stronger dose.\nHowever, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You'll need a stem cell or\u00a0bone marrow transplants to replace the damaged bone marrow.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy is\u00a0most\u00a0often\u00a0used to treat early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in 1 part of the body.\nTreatment is normally given in short daily sessions, Monday to Friday, over several weeks. You should not have to stay in hospital between appointments.\nRadiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary, depending on which part of your body is being treated. For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss.\nOther common side effects include:\n\nsore and red skin in the treatment area\ntiredness\nnausea and vomiting\ndry mouth\nloss of appetite\n\nMost side effects are temporary, but there's a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area.\nRead more about:\n\nside effects of radiotherapy\ncomplications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n\nMonoclonal antibody\u00a0therapy\nFor some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody.\nThese medications attach themselves\u00a0to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulate the immune system to attack and kill the cells. They're often given in combination with chemotherapy to make the treatment more effective.\nFor some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may continue having monoclonal antibody treatment regularly for up to 2 years after initial treatment, in combination with\u00a0chemotherapy. This can reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the future.\nOne of the main\u00a0monoclonal antibody medications used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma is called rituximab.\u00a0This medication\u00a0is administered directly into your vein over the course of a few hours.\nSide effects of rituximab can include:\n\nflu-like symptoms, such as\u00a0headaches, fever and chills\ntiredness\nnausea\nan itchy rash\n\nYou may be given additional medication to prevent or lessen these side effects. Side effects should improve over time, as your body gets used to rituximab.\nAs\u00a0rituximab has been so successful in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma, scientists are working hard to make more monoclonal antibody treatments for lymphoma, and some of these are already at an advanced stage in clinical trials. You may be asked if you want to participate in one of these trials during your treatment.\nSteroid medication\nSteroid medication is commonly\u00a0used in combination with chemotherapy to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is because research has shown that using steroids makes the chemotherapy more effective.\nThe steroid medication is normally\u00a0given as tablets, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. A short course of steroids, lasting no more than a few months, is usually recommended, as this limits the number of side effects you could have.\nCommon side effects of short-term steroid use include:\n\nincreased appetite, which can lead to weight gain\nindigestion\nproblems sleeping\nfeeling agitated\n\nOn rare occasions, you may have to take steroids on a long-term basis. Side effects of long-term steroid use include weight gain and swelling in your hands, feet and eyelids.\nThe side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes.\nFollow-up\nAfter your course of treatment ends, you may have a repeat scan to see how well the treatment has worked. Following this, you'll need regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning (known as a 'relapse').\nThese appointments will start off being every few weeks or months, but become less frequent over time.\nRead further\u00a0information:\n\nCancer Research UK: treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nCancer Research UK: living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nMacmillan: treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma\nMacmillan: living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma\n\n\n\nSome people treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma experience long-term problems, even if they've been cured.\nWeakened immune system\nHaving a weakened immune system is a common complication of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and it can become more severe while you're being treated.\nHowever, your immune system will usually recover in the months and years after treatment.\nIf you have a weak immune system, you're more vulnerable to infections, and there's an increased risk of developing serious complications from infections. In some cases, you may be advised to take regular doses of antibiotics to prevent infections occurring.\nIt's also important to report any symptoms of an infection to your GP or care team immediately, because prompt treatment may be needed to prevent serious complications.\u00a0This is particularly important in the first few months after treatment.\nSymptoms of infection include:\n\na high temperature (fever)\nheadache\naching muscles\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\na painful blistering rash\n\nYou should make sure that all of your vaccinations are up to date.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to speak to your GP or care team about this because it may not be safe for you to have 'live' vaccines (vaccines containing a weakened form of the virus or organism being vaccinated against) until several months after your treatment finishes.\nExamples of 'live' vaccines include the:\n\nshingles\u00a0vaccine\nBCG vaccine (against tuberculosis)\nMMR vaccine (against measles, mumps and rubella)\n\nInfertility\nChemotherapy\u00a0and\u00a0radiotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause infertility. This is sometimes temporary, but it can be permanent.\nYour care team will estimate the risk of infertility in your specific circumstances and let you know your options.\nIn some cases, it may be possible for men to store samples of their sperm and for women to store their eggs before treatment, so these can be used to try for a baby afterwards.\nSecond cancers\nHaving treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. This is known as a 'second cancer'.\nThe risk of getting cancer is particularly increased after cancer treatment because chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage healthy cells, as well as cancer cells. This damage can then cause the affected cells to become cancerous many years after treatment.\nYou can help to reduce your risk of a second cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight with a balanced diet, and getting regular exercise.\nYou should report any symptoms that might suggest another cancer to your GP at an early stage and attend any cancer screening appointments you're invited to.\nTreatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma can increase your risk of getting certain\u00a0conditions\u00a0at a younger age than normal, such as:\n\nheart disease\nlung disease\nkidney disease\nthyroid disease\ndiabetes\u00a0\ncataracts\n\nHaving a cancer diagnosis can also increase your risk of depression.\nYou should report unexpected symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, to your GP.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "The term 'obese' describes a person who's very overweight, with a lot of body fat.\nIt's a common problem in the UK that's estimated to affect\u00a0around one in every four adults and around one in every five children aged 10 to 11.\nDefining obesity\nThere are many ways in which a person's health in relation to their weight can be classified, but the most widely used method is body mass index (BMI).\nBMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. You can use the BMI healthy weight chart\u00a0to work out your\u00a0score.\nFor most adults, a BMI of:\n\n18.5 to 24.9 means you're a healthy weight\n25 to 29.9 means you're overweight\n30 to 39.9 means you're obese\n40 or above means you're severely obese\n\nBMI isn't used to definitively diagnose obesity, because people who are very muscular sometimes have a high BMI without excess fat.\u00a0But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they're a healthy weight, overweight or obese.\nA better measure of excess fat is waist circumference, which can be used as an additional measure in people who are overweight (with a BMI of 25 to 29.9) or moderately obese (with a BMI of 30 to 34.9).\nGenerally, men with a waist circumference of 94cm (37in) or more and women with a waist circumference of 80cm (about 31.5in) or more are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.\nRead more about diagnosing obesity\nRisks of obesity\nIt's very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing\u00a0obvious physical changes, it\u00a0can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as:\n\ntype 2 diabetes\u00a0\ncoronary heart disease\u00a0\nsome types of cancer, such as\u00a0breast cancer and\u00a0bowel cancer\nstroke\n\nObesity can also affect your quality of life and lead to psychological problems, such as depression\u00a0and\u00a0low self-esteem (see below for more information about the health problems associated with obesity).\nCauses of obesity\nObesity is generally caused by consuming more calories \u2013 particularly those in fatty and sugary foods \u2013 than you burn off through physical activity.\u00a0The excess energy is stored by the body as fat.\nObesity is an increasingly common problem because for many people modern living involves eating excessive amounts of cheap, high-calorie food and spending a lot of time sitting down, at desks, on sofas or in cars.\nThere are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these type of conditions don\u2019t usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medication.\nRead more about the causes of obesity\nTreating obesity\nThe best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly. To do this you should:\n\neat a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian)\njoin a local weight loss group\ntake up activities such as fast walking, jogging,\u00a0swimming or tennis for 150 to 300\u00a0minutes (two-and-a-half to five hours) a week\neat slowly and avoid situations where you know you could be tempted to overeat\n\nYou may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating.\nIf lifestyle changes alone don't help you lose weight, a medication called orlistat may be recommended. If taken correctly, this medication works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.\nIn rare cases, weight loss surgery\u00a0may be recommended.\nRead more about\u00a0how obesity is treated\nOther obesity-related problems\nObesity can\u00a0cause a\u00a0number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions.\nDay-to-day problems related to obesity include:\n\nbreathlessness\nincreased sweating\nsnoring\ndifficulty\u00a0doing\u00a0physical activity\noften feeling very tired\njoint and\u00a0back pain\nlow confidence and self-esteem\nfeeling isolated\n\nThe psychological problems associated with being obese can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression.\nBeing obese can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious\u00a0health conditions, including:\n\ntype 2 diabetes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high\nhigh blood pressure\nhigh cholesterol\u00a0and\u00a0atherosclerosis (where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and\u00a0stroke\nasthma\nmetabolic syndrome \u2013\u00a0a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity\nseveral types of cancer, including bowel cancer, breast cancer\u00a0and womb cancer\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the oesophagus (gullet)\ngallstones\u00a0\u2013\u00a0small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder\nreduced fertility\nosteoarthritis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints\nsleep apnoea\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease\nliver disease and kidney disease\npregnancy complications,\u00a0such as\u00a0gestational diabetes or\u00a0pre-eclampsia (when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy)\n\nObesity reduces life expectancy by an average of\u00a03 to\u00a010 years, depending on how severe it is. It's estimated that obesity and being overweight contribute to at least\u00a01 in every 13 deaths in Europe.\nOutlook\nThere's no \"quick fix\" for obesity. Weight loss programmes take time and commitment, and work best when fully completed. The healthcare professionals involved with your care should provide encouragement and advice about how to maintain the weight loss achieved.\nRegularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals and involving your friends and family with your attempts to lose weight\u00a0can also help.\nRemember that even losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\nObesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little.\nIf you consume high amounts of energy, particularly fat and sugars, but don't burn off the energy through exercise and physical activity, much of the surplus energy will be stored by the body as fat.\nCalories\nThe energy value of food is measured in units called calories. The average physically active man needs about 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and the average physically active woman needs about 2,000 calories a day.\nThis amount of calories may sound high, but it can be easy to reach if you eat certain types of food. For example, eating a large takeaway hamburger, fries and a milkshake can total 1,500 calories \u2013 and that's just one meal.\u00a0\nAnother problem is that many people aren't physically active, so lots of the calories they consume end up being stored in their body as fat.\nPoor diet\nObesity doesn't happen overnight. It develops gradually over time, as a result of poor diet and lifestyle choices, such as:\n\neating large amounts of processed or fast food \u2013 that's high in fat and sugar\ndrinking too much\u00a0alcohol \u2013\u00a0alcohol contains a lot of calories, and people who drink heavily are often overweight\neating out a lot \u2013\u00a0you may be tempted to also have a starter or dessert in a restaurant, and the food can be higher in fat and sugar\neating larger portions than you need \u2013\u00a0you may be encouraged to eat too much if your friends or relatives are also eating large portions\ndrinking too many sugary drinks \u2013 including soft drinks and fruit juice\ncomfort eating \u2013\u00a0if you have low self-esteem or feel depressed, you may eat to make yourself feel better\n\nUnhealthy eating habits tend to run in families. You may learn bad eating habits from your parents when you're young and continue them into adulthood.\nRead more about eating well\nLack of physical activity\nLack of physical activity is another important factor related to obesity. Many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk for most of the day. They also rely on their cars, rather than\u00a0walking or cycling.\nFor\u00a0relaxation, many people tend to watch TV, browse the internet or play computer games, and rarely take regular exercise.\nIf you're not active enough, you don't use the energy provided by the food you eat, and the extra energy you consume is stored by the body as fat.\nThe Department of Health recommends that adults do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. This doesn\u2019t need to be done all\u00a0in one go, but can be broken down into smaller periods. For example, you could exercise for 30 minutes a day for five days a week.\nIf you're obese and trying to lose weight, you may need to do more exercise than this. It may help to start off slowly and gradually increase the amount of exercise you do each week.\nRead more about the physical activity guidelines for adults\nGenetics\nSome people claim\u00a0there's no point trying to lose weight because \"it runs in my family\" or \"it's in my genes\".\nWhile there are some rare genetic conditions that can cause obesity, such as\u00a0Prader-Willi syndrome, there's no reason why most people can't lose weight.\nIt may be true that certain genetic traits inherited from your parents\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as having a large appetite\u00a0\u2013\u00a0may make losing weight more difficult, but it certainly doesn't make it impossible.\nIn many cases, obesity is more to do with environmental factors, such as poor eating habits learned during childhood.\nMedical reasons\nIn some cases, underlying medical conditions may contribute to weight gain. These include:\n\nan\u00a0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones\nCushing's syndrome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a rare disorder that causes the over-production of steroid hormones\n\nHowever, if conditions such as these are properly diagnosed and treated, they should pose less of a barrier to weight loss.\nCertain medicines, including some\u00a0corticosteroids, medications for epilepsy and diabetes, and some medications used to treat mental illness\u00a0\u2013 including antidepressants and medicines for\u00a0schizophrenia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0can contribute to weight gain.\nWeight gain can sometimes be a side effect of\u00a0stopping smoking\n\n\nBody mass index (BMI) is widely used as a simple and reliable way of finding out whether a person is a healthy weight for their height.\nFor most adults, having a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 means you're considered to be a healthy weight. A person with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered to be overweight, and someone with a BMI over 30 is considered to be obese.\nWhile BMI is a useful measurement for most people, it's not accurate for everyone.\nFor example, the normal BMI scores may not be accurate if you're very muscular because muscle can add extra pounds, resulting in\u00a0a high BMI when you're not an unhealthy weight. In such cases, your waist circumference may be a better guide (see below).\nWhat's considered a healthy BMI is also influenced by your ethnic background. The scores mentioned above generally apply to people with a white Caucasian background. If you have an ethnic minority background, the threshold for being considered overweight or obese may be lower.\nBMI shouldn't be used to work out whether a child is a healthy weight, because\u00a0their bodies are still developing.\u00a0Speak to your GP if you want to find out whether your child is overweight.\nVisiting your GP\nIf you're overweight or obese,\u00a0visit your GP for advice about\u00a0losing weight safely and to find out whether you have an increased risk of health problems.\nYour GP\u00a0may ask about:\n\nyour lifestyle \u2013 particularly your diet and how much physical activity you do; they'll also ask you whether you smoke and how much\u00a0alcohol you drink\nany possible underlying causes for your obesity \u2013 for example, if you're taking medication or have a medical condition that may contribute to\u00a0weight gain\nhow you feel about being overweight \u2013 for example, if it makes you feel depressed\nhow motivated you are to lose weight\nyour family history \u2013 as obesity and other health conditions, such as diabetes, are often more common in families\n\nAs well as calculating your BMI, your GP may also carry out tests to determine whether you're at increased risk of developing health complications because of your weight.\nThese could include\u00a0measuring your:\n\nblood pressure\nglucose (sugar) and cholesterol levels in a blood sample\nwaist circumference (the distance around your waist)\n\nPeople with very large waists \u2013 generally, 94cm (37in) or more in men and 80cm (about 31.5in) or more in women \u2013 are more likely to develop obesity-related health problems.\nYour GP may also take your ethnicity into account because it can affect your risk of developing certain conditions. For example, some people of Asian, African or Afro-Caribbean ethnicity may be at increased risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). Healthy waist measurements can also be different for people from different ethnic backgrounds.\nAfter your assessment, you'll be offered an appointment to discuss the results in more detail, ask any questions that you have, and fully explore the treatment options available to you.\n\n\nIf you're obese, speak to your GP for advice about losing weight safely.\nYour GP can advise you about losing weight safely by eating a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet and regular physical activity.\nThey can also let you know about\u00a0other useful services, such as:\n\nlocal weight loss groups \u2013 these could be provided by your local authority, the NHS, or commercial services you may have to pay for\nexercise on prescription \u2013 where you're referred to a local active health team for a number of sessions under the supervision of a qualified trainer\n\nIf you have underlying problems associated with obesity, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),\u00a0high blood pressure,\u00a0diabetes or obstructive sleep apnoea, your GP may recommend further tests or specific treatment. In some cases, they may refer you to a specialist.\nRead more about how your GP can help you lose weight\nDiet\nThere's no single rule that applies to everyone, but to lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 0.5 to 1kg (1lb to 2lbs) a week, most people are advised to reduce their energy intake by 600 calories a day.\nFor most men, this will mean consuming no more than 1,900 calories a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400 calories a day.\nThe best way to achieve this\u00a0is to swap unhealthy and high-energy food choices \u2013 such as fast food, processed food and sugary drinks (including alcohol) \u2013 for healthier choices.\nA healthy diet should consist of:\n\nplenty of fruit and vegetables\nplenty of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and other starchy foods (ideally you should choose wholegrain varieties)\nsome\u00a0milk and dairy foods\nsome meat, fish, aggs,\u00a0beans\u00a0and other non-dairy sources of protein\njust small amounts of food and drinks that are high in\u00a0fat\u00a0and\u00a0suagr\n\nTry to avoid\u00a0foods containing high levels of salt because they can raise your blood pressure, which can be dangerous\u00a0for people who are already obese.\nYou'll also need to check\u00a0calorie information for each type of food and drink you consume to make sure you don't go over your daily limit.\nSome restaurants,\u00a0caf\u00e9s and fast food outlets provide calorie information per portion, although providing this information isn't compulsory. Be careful\u00a0when eating out because some foods can quickly take you over the limit, such as burgers, fried chicken, and some curries or Chinese dishes.\nAvoid\u00a0fad diets that recommend unsafe practices, such as fasting (going without food for long periods of time) or cutting out entire food groups. These types of diets\u00a0don't work, can make you feel ill, and aren't sustainable because they don\u2019t teach you long-term healthy eating habits.\nThis isn't to say that all commercial diet programmes are unsafe. Many are based on sound medical and scientific principles and can work well for some people.\nA responsible diet programme should:\n\neducate you about issues such as portion size, making behavioural changes\u00a0and healthy eating\u00a0\nnot be overly restrictive in terms of the type of foods you can eat\u00a0\nbe based on achieving gradual, sustainable weight loss rather than short-term rapid weight loss, which is unlikely to last\n\nA\u00a0very low calorie diet (VLCD) is where you consume less than 800 calories a day.\nThese diets can lead to rapid weight loss, but\u00a0they aren't a suitable or safe method for everyone, and they aren't routinely recommended for managing obesity.\nVLCDs are usually only recommended if you have an obesity-related complication that would benefit from rapid weight loss.\nVLCDs\u00a0shouldn't usually be followed for longer than 12 weeks at a time, and they should only be used under the supervision of a suitably qualified healthcare professional.\nSpeak to your GP first if\u00a0you're considering this type of diet.\nExercise\nReducing the amount of calories in your diet will help you lose weight, but maintaining a healthy weight requires physical activity to burn energy.\nAs well as helping you maintain a healthy weight, physical activity also has wider health benefits. For example, it can help prevent and manage more than\u00a020 conditions, such as reducing the risk of\u00a0type 2 diabetes by 40%.\nThe Chief Medical Officers recommend that adults should do at least 150 minutes (two-and-a-half hours) of at least moderate-intensity activity a week \u2013 for example, five 30-minute bouts a week. Something is better than nothing, and doing just 10 minutes of exercise at a time is beneficial.\nModerate-intensity activity is any activity that increases your heart and breathing rate, such as:\n\nbrisk walking\ncycling\nrecreational swimming\ndancing\n\nAlternatively, you could do 75 minutes (one hour, fifteen minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity\u00a0a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity.\nDuring vigorous activity, breathing is very hard, your heart beats rapidly and you may be unable to hold a conversation. Examples include:\n\nrunning\nmost competitive sports\ncircuit training\n\nYou should also do strength and balance training two days a week. This could be in the form of a\u00a0gym workout, carrying shopping bags, or doing an activity such as\u00a0tai chi.\u00a0It's also critical that you break up sitting (sedentary) time by getting up and moving around.\nRead more about\u00a0strength\u00a0and\u00a0balance exercises.\nYour GP, weight loss adviser or staff at\u00a0your local sports centre can help you create a plan suited to your own personal needs and circumstances, with achievable and motivating goals. Start small and build up gradually.\nIt's also\u00a0important to find activities you enjoy and want to keep doing. Activities with a social element or exercising with friends or family can help keep you motivated. Make a start today \u2013 it\u2019s never too late.\nRead more about the\u00a0physical activity guidelines for adults and the physical activity guidelines for older adults.\nOther useful strategies\nEvidence has shown that weight loss can be more successful if it involves other strategies, alongside diet and lifestyle changes. This could include things like:\n\nsetting realistic weight loss goals \u2013 if you're obese, losing just 3% of your original body weight can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications\neating more slowly and being mindful of what and when you're eating \u2013 for example, not being distracted by watching TV\navoiding situations where you know you may be tempted to overeat\ninvolving your family and friends with your weight loss efforts \u2013they can help to motivate you\nmonitoring your progress \u2013 for example, weigh yourself regularly and make a note of your weight in a diary\n\nGetting psychological support from a trained healthcare professional may also\u00a0help you change the way you think about food and eating. Techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0can be useful.\nIt's important to remember that as you lose weight your body needs less food (calories), so after a few months, weight loss slows and levels off, even if you continue to follow a diet.\nIf you go back to your previous calorie intake once you've lost weight, it's very likely you'll put the weight back on. Increasing physical activity to up to 60 minutes a day and continuing to watch what you eat may help you keep the weight off.\nMedication\nMany\u00a0different types of anti-obesity medicines have been tested in clinical trials, but only one has proved to be safe and effective: orlistat.\nYou can only use orlistat if a doctor or pharmacist thinks it's the right medicine for you. In most cases, orlistat is only available on prescription. Only one product (Alli) is available over the counter directly from pharmacies, under the supervision of a pharmacist.\nOrlistat works by preventing\u00a0around a third of the fat from the food you eat being absorbed. The undigested fat isn't absorbed into your body and is passed out with your faeces (stools). This will help you avoid gaining weight, but won't necessarily cause you to lose weight.\nA balanced diet and exercise programme should be started before beginning treatment with orlistat, and you should continue this programme during treatment and after you stop\u00a0taking orlistat.\nOrlistat will usually only be recommended if you've made a significant effort to lose weight through diet, exercise or changing your lifestyle.\nEven then, orlistat is only prescribed if you have a:\n\nbody mass index (BMI) of 28 or more, and other weight-related conditions,\u00a0such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes\nBMI of 30 or more\n\nBefore prescribing orlistat, your doctor will discuss the benefits and potential limitations with you, including any potential side effects (see below).\u00a0\nTreatment with orlistat must be combined with a balanced low-fat diet and other weight loss strategies, such as doing more exercise.\u00a0It's important that the diet is nutritionally balanced over three main meals.\nIf you're prescribed orlistat, you'll also be offered advice and support about diet, exercise and making lifestyle changes.\nOrlistat isn't usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women.\nOne orlistat capsule is taken with water immediately before, during or up to one hour after, each main meal (up to a maximum of three capsules a day).\nIf you miss a meal, or the meal doesn't contain any fat, you shouldn't need to take the orlistat capsule. Your doctor should explain this to you, or you can check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\nTreatment with orlistat should only continue beyond three months if you've lost 5% of your body weight. It usually starts to affect how you digest fat within\u00a0one to two\u00a0days.\nIf you haven't lost weight after taking orlistat for\u00a0three months, it's unlikely to be an effective treatment for you. Consult your doctor or pharmacist, as it may be necessary to stop your treatment.\nSee your GP before starting treatment with orlistat if you have another serious health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease, which you're taking medication for. It may be necessary to change the dose of your medicine.\nIf you have\u00a0type 2 diabetes, it may take you longer to lose weight using orlistat, so your target weight loss after three months may therefore be slightly lower.\nIf orlistat has helped you lose weight after three months, your prescription may be continued for up to a year. After that, your GP will carry out a review and decide whether you should continue taking it.\nCommon side effects of orlistat include:\n\nfatty or oily stools\nneeding the toilet urgently\npassing stools more frequently\nan oily discharge from your rectum (you may have oily spots on your underwear)\nflatulence (wind)\nstomach pain\nheadaches\nupper respiratory tract infections, such as a cold\n\nThese side effects are much less likely to occur if you stick to a low-fat diet.\nWomen taking\u00a0the\u00a0oral contraceptive pill\u00a0should use an additional method of contraception, such as a\u00a0condom, if they experience severe diarrhoea while taking orlistat. This is because the contraceptive pill may not be absorbed by your body if you have diarrhoea, so it may not be effective.\nSurgery\nWeight loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is sometimes used to treat people who are severely obese.\nBariatric surgery is usually only available on the NHS to treat people with severe obesity who fulfil all of the following criteria:\n\nthey have a BMI of 40 or more, or between 35 and 40 and another serious health condition that could be improved with weight loss, such as type 2 diabetes\u00a0or\u00a0high blood pressure\nall appropriate non-surgical measures have been tried, but the person hasn't achieved or maintained adequate, clinically beneficial weight loss\nthe person is fit enough to have\u00a0anaesthesia and surgery\nthe person has been receiving, or will receive, intensive management as part of their treatment\nthe person commits to the need for long-term follow-up\n\nBariatric surgery may also be considered as a possible treatment option for people with a BMI of 30 to 35 who have recently (in the last 10 years) been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\nIn rare cases, surgery may be recommended as the first treatment (instead of lifestyle treatments and medication) if a person's BMI is 50 or above.\nTreating obesity in children usually involves improvements to diet and increasing physical activity using behaviour change strategies.\nThe amount of calories your child should eat each day will depend on their age and height. Your GP should be able to advise you about a recommended daily limit, and they may also be able to refer you to your local family healthy lifestyle programme.\nChildren over the age of five should ideally get at least one hour (60 minutes) of vigorous-intensity exercise a day, such as running or playing football or netball. Sedentary activities, such as watching television and playing computer games, should be restricted.\nRead more about the physical activity guidelines for children and young people\nReferral to a specialist in treating childhood obesity may be recommended if your child develops an obesity-related complication, or there's thought to be an underlying medical condition causing obesity.\nThe use of orlistat in children is only recommended in exceptional circumstances, such as if a child is severely obese and has an obesity-related complication.\nBariatric surgery isn't generally recommended for children, but may be considered for young people in exceptional circumstances, and if they've achieved, or nearly achieved, physiological maturity.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive activity.\nAn obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters a person's mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease.\nA compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought.\nFor example, someone with a fear of their house being burgled may feel they need to check all the windows and doors are locked several times before they can leave the house.\nOCD symptoms can range from mild to severe. Some people with OCD may spend an hour or so a day engaged in obsessive-compulsive thinking and behaviour, but for others the condition can completely take over their life.\nRead more about the symptoms of OCD.\nWhat causes OCD?\nIt's not clear exactly what causes OCD, although a number of factors have been suggested.\nIn some cases the condition\u00a0may run in families, and\u00a0may be\u00a0linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain's development.\nBrain imaging studies have shown the brains of some people with OCD can be different\u00a0from the brains of\u00a0people who do not have the condition.\nFor example, there may be\u00a0increased activity\u00a0in certain areas of the brain, particularly those that deal with strong emotions and the responses to them.\nStudies have also shown\u00a0people with OCD have an imbalance of serotonin in their brain. Serotonin is a chemical the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another.\nRead more about the causes of OCD.\nWho is affected?\nIt's estimated around 12 in every 1,000 people in the UK are affected by the condition. This equates to almost 750,000 people.\nOCD\u00a0affects men, women and children. The condition typically\u00a0first starts to significantly interfere with a person's life during early adulthood, although problems can develop at any age.\nGetting help\nPeople with OCD are often reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed\u00a0or embarrassed.\nHowever,\u00a0if you have OCD,\u00a0there is nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. It is a long-term health condition like\u00a0diabetes or asthma,\u00a0and it\u00a0is not your fault you have it.\nSeeking help is important because it is unlikely your symptoms will improve if left\u00a0untreated, and they may get worse.\nYou should visit\u00a0your GP if you think you may have OCD. Initially, they will probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect you.\nIf your GP suspects OCD, you may need to be\u00a0referred to a specialist for an assessment and appropriate treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing OCD.\nHow\u00a0OCD is treated\nWith treatment, the outlook for OCD is good. Many people will eventually be cured of their OCD, or their symptoms will at least be reduced enough\u00a0that they can enjoy a good quality of life.\nThe main treatments for OCD are:\n\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 involving a therapy known as graded exposure with response prevention (ERP), which encourages you to face your fear and let the obsessive thoughts occur without \"neutralising\" them with compulsions\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2013\u00a0this medication can help reduce your symptoms by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain\n\nIf these treatments aren't effective or your condition is particularly severe,\u00a0you may need to be referred to a specialist mental health service for treatment.\nRead more about treating OCD.\n\n\nObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) affects people differently, but usually causes a particular pattern of thought and behaviour.\nThis pattern has four main steps:\n\nobsession \u2013\u00a0where an unwanted, intrusive and often distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters\u00a0your mind\nanxiety \u2013\u00a0the obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety\u00a0or distress\ncompulsion \u2013\u00a0repetitive behaviours or mental acts that you feel driven to perform as a result of the anxiety and distress caused by the obsession\ntemporary relief \u2013\u00a0the compulsive behaviour brings temporary relief from anxiety, but the obsession and anxiety soon return, causing the cycle to begin again\n\nObsessive thoughts\nAlmost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life, such as a concern that they may have forgotten to lock the door of the house or that they may contract a disease from touching other people, or even sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images.\nMost people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context, and they can carry on with their day-to-day life. They do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance.\nHowever, if you have a persistent, unwanted and unpleasant thought that dominates your thinking to the extent it interrupts other thoughts, you may have developed an obsession.\nSome common obsessions that affect people with OCD include:\n\nfear of deliberately harming yourself or others \u2013 for example, fear\u00a0you may attack someone else, even though this type of behaviour disgusts you\nfear of harming yourself or others by mistake or accident \u2013\u00a0for example, fear you may set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the cooker on\nfear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance\na need for symmetry or orderliness \u2013 for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the labels on the tins in your cupboard face the same way\n\nCompulsive behaviour\nCompulsions arise as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. However, this behaviour is either excessive or not realistically connected at all.\nFor example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands\u00a0repeatedly throughout the day, or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to \"neutralise\" the thought of harm. This latter type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with OCD.\nMost people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational and makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion.\nSome common types of compulsive behaviour that affect people with OCD include:\n\ncleaning and hand washing\nchecking\u00a0\u2013 such as checking doors are locked, or that the gas or a tap is off\ncounting\nordering and arranging\nhoarding\nasking for reassurance\nrepeating words silently\nextensively \"overthinking\" to ensure the feared consequence of the obsession does not occur\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if you fear you may act violently\nthinking \"neutralising\" thoughts to counter the obsessive thoughts\navoiding places and\u00a0situations that could trigger obsessive thoughts\n\nNot all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people.\nRelated problems\nSome people with OCD may also have or develop other serious mental health problems, including:\n\ndepression\u00a0\u2013 a condition that typically causes lasting feelings of sadness and hopelessness, or\u00a0a loss of interest in the things you used to enjoy\neating disorders\u00a0\u2013 conditions\u00a0characterised by an abnormal attitude towards food that cause you to change\u00a0your eating habits and behaviour\ngeneralised anxiety disorder \u2013\u00a0a condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event\na hoarding disorder \u2013 a condition that involves excessively acquiring items and not being able to throw them away, resulting in unmanageable amounts of clutter\n\nPeople with OCD and severe depression also frequently have suicidal feelings.\nGetting help\nOCD can stop you carrying out normal day-to-day activities and can have a significant\u00a0impact on your career, education and social life.\nIt is therefore important\u00a0to seek help from your GP if you think you have the condition. With the correct diagnosis and treatment, you should be able to manage your\u00a0symptoms and have a better quality of life.\nYou should also visit your GP if you think you may have one of the related mental health problems mentioned above, as these conditions\u00a0may become more severe if they are left untreated and\u00a0may make it more difficult for you to cope with your OCD.\nContact your GP or care team immediately if you are depressed and feeling suicidal. You can also telephone the Samaritans to talk in confidence to a counsellor on 08457 90 90 90. Alternatively, you can call NHS 111.\nIf you think a friend or family member may have OCD, it's a good idea to talk to them about your concerns and suggest they seek medical advice.\nWhile it might seem natural to try\u00a0to protect the person with OCD from their own fears,\u00a0this is counterproductive because it means the problem is not resolved and there is no hope of moving on.\nRead more about diagnosing OCD.\n\n\nDespite much research being carried out into obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), the exact cause of the condition has not yet been identified.\nHowever, a number of different factors that may play a role in the condition have been suggested. These are described below.\nGenetics\nGenetics\u00a0is\u00a0thought to play a part\u00a0in some cases of OCD. Research suggests OCD may be the result of certain inherited genes that affect the development of the brain.\nAlthough no specific genes have been linked to OCD, there is some evidence that suggests a\u00a0person with OCD is more likely to have another family member with the condition compared with someone who does not have OCD.\nHowever, it is possible there may sometimes be other reasons for this. For example, it has been suggested some people may \"learn\" OCD as a result of\u00a0witnessing other family members with the condition.\nBrain differences\nBrain imaging studies have shown some people with OCD have differences in\u00a0certain parts of their brain, including increased activity and\u00a0blood flow, and a lack of the brain chemical serotonin.\nThe areas of the brain affected\u00a0deal with strong emotions and how we respond\u00a0to those emotions. In the studies, brain activity returned to normal after successful treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0or\u00a0selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\nSerotonin may play a part in OCD.\u00a0This\u00a0brain chemical transmits information from one brain cell to another and is known as a neurotransmitter.\nSerotonin is responsible for regulating a number of the body's functions, including mood, anxiety, memory and sleep.\nIt is not known for sure how serotonin contributes to OCD, but some people with the condition appear\u00a0to have decreased levels of the chemical\u00a0in their brain.\nMedication that increases the levels of serotonin in the brain, such as certain types of\u00a0antidepressant, have proven effective\u00a0in treating OCD.\nLife events\nOCD may be more common in people with a history of having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse, neglect, social isolation, teasing or bullying.\nAn important\u00a0life event, such as a bereavement,\u00a0family break-up, a new job, pregnancy or childbirth,\u00a0may also trigger\u00a0OCD in people who already have a tendency to develop\u00a0the condition\u00a0\u2013 for example, because of genetic factors\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and may affect the course of the condition.\nFor example, the death of a loved one may trigger a fear that someone in your family will be harmed.\nStress seems to make the\u00a0symptoms of OCD\u00a0worse, but does not cause OCD on its own.\nPersonality\nPeople with certain personality traits may be more likely to have OCD. For example,\u00a0if you are a neat, meticulous, methodical person with high standards\u00a0\u2013 a \"perfectionist\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may be more likely to develop the condition.\nOCD may also be a result of simply being\u00a0more prone to becoming tense and anxious than most people, or having a\u00a0very strong sense of responsibility for\u00a0yourself and others.\n\n\nIt is very important you visit your GP if you have symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).\nThe impact of OCD\u00a0on your day-to-day life can be reduced if the condition is diagnosed and effectively treated.\nMany people with OCD do not report their symptoms to their\u00a0GP because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. They may also try\u00a0to disguise their symptoms from family and friends.\nHowever, if you have OCD, you should not\u00a0feel ashamed or embarrassed. Like\u00a0diabetes or asthma, OCD is a long-term health condition, and it is not your fault you have it.\nIf you think a friend or family member may have OCD, it's a good idea to talk to them carefully\u00a0about your concerns and suggest they seek medical advice.\nInitial questions\nYour GP will probably ask you\u00a0a series of questions to\u00a0determine whether it's likely you have OCD.\nThese may be similar to\u00a0the following:\n\nDo you wash or clean a lot?\nDo you check things a lot?\nDo you have thoughts that keep bothering you that you would like to get rid of but cannot?\nDo your daily activities take a long time to finish?\nAre you concerned about putting things in a special order or are you upset by mess?\nDo these problems trouble you?\n\nAssessment\nIf the results of the initial screening questions suggest you have OCD, the severity of your symptoms will be assessed either by your GP or\u00a0a mental health professional.\nThere are several different methods of assessment. All involve asking\u00a0detailed questions to find out how much of your day-to-day life is affected by obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behaviour.\nDuring the assessment, it is important\u00a0you are open and honest, as accurate and truthful responses will ensure you receive\u00a0the most appropriate treatment.\nOCD is classified into three levels of severity:\n\nmild functional impairment \u2013 obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviour that occupies less than one hour of your day\nmoderate functional impairment \u2013 obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviour that occupies\u00a0one to three\u00a0hours of your day\nsevere functional impairment \u2013 obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviour that occupies more than three hours of your day\n\nHealthcare professionals use the term \"functional impairment\" to\u00a0refer to the disruption of your daily activities.\n\n\nTreatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) depends on the how much the condition is affecting your daily life.\nThe two main treatments are:\n\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) involving graded exposure and response prevention (ERP) \u2013 therapy that encourages you to face your fear and let the obsessive thoughts occur without \"putting them right\" or \"neutralising\" them with compulsions\nmedication \u2013 to control your symptoms by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain\n\nOCD that has a relatively minor impact on your daily life is usually treated with a short course of CBT involving ERP.\nIf you have OCD that has a more significant impact on your daily life, a more intensive course of CBT with ERP or a type of medication known as\u00a0selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be recommended instead. You may also be referred to a specialist mental health service.\nIf your OCD has a severe impact on your daily life, you will usually be referred to a specialist mental health service for a combination of intensive CBT and a course of SSRIs.\nChildren with OCD are usually referred to a healthcare professional with experience of treating OCD in children.\nThe level of treatment for OCD can be increased in steps until it is effective. For example, if a short course of CBT does not help, you may move on to trying SSRIs.\nIt's important to remember it can take several months before a treatment has a noticeable effect.\nCognitive behavioural therapy with exposure and response prevention\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that involves exposure and response prevention (ERP) can be used to help people with OCD of all severities.\nPeople with mild to moderate OCD usually need about 10 hours of therapist treatment, combined with exercises done at home between sessions.\nThose with moderate to severe OCD may need a more intensive course of CBT that lasts longer than 10 hours.\nDuring the sessions, you will work with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts, such as your thoughts, physical feelings and actions.\nYour therapist will also need to ask you to use a technique called graded ERP. This therapy encourages you to face your fear and let the obsessive thoughts occur without \"putting them right\" or neutralising them with compulsions.\nIt requires motivation and is difficult, but should start with situations that cause you the least anxiety first.\nThese exposure exercises need to take place several times a day, and need to be done for one to two hours without engaging in compulsions to undo them.\nAlthough this sounds frightening, people with OCD find that when they confront their anxiety without carrying out their compulsion, the anxiety does eventually improve or go away. Each time, the anxiety is likely to be less and last for a shorter period of time.\nOnce you have conquered one exposure task, you can move on to a more difficult task, until you have overcome all of the situations that make you anxious.\u00a0\nMedication\nYou may need medication if CBT fails to treat mild OCD or if you have moderate or severe OCD. The main type of medication you may be prescribed is discussed below.\nIf these medications prove ineffective, you will be referred to a specialist mental health service.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of\u00a0antidepressant medication that increase the levels of a chemical called serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another.\nAlthough SSRIs are a type of antidepressant, they have been shown to work in people with OCD regardless of their level of depression. The doses\u00a0that have been shown to be effective in OCD are also higher than those generally used for depression.\nPossible SSRIs you may be prescribed include:\n\ncitalopram\nescitalopram\nfluoxetine\nfluvoxamine\nparoxetine\nsertraline\n\nYou will usually need to take an SSRI for 12 weeks before you notice any benefit. Most people with moderate to severe OCD need to take one for at least 12 months.\nAfter this time, your condition will be reviewed. If it causes few or no troublesome symptoms, you may be able to stop taking the medication.\nPeople with more severe OCD, however, may need to take the medication for many years to prevent the condition recurring.\nPossible side effects of SSRIs can include headaches, feeling agitated or shaky, and feeling sick. However, these will often pass within a few weeks.\nSSRIs can also affect your heart, so it is advisable to have an electrocardiogram (ECG) after being on the medication for a few weeks.\u00a0An ECG is a simple test to measure the electrical activity of your heart.\nThere is also an extremely small chance that SSRIs will increase your anxiety, which can very occasionally cause you to have\u00a0suicidal thoughts or a desire to\u00a0self-harm.\nContact your GP immediately or go to\u00a0your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department if you are taking an SSRI and have suicidal thoughts or want to self-harm.\nYou may also have side effects when you stop taking SSRIs, so you shouldn't stop taking your medicine suddenly. If you no longer need the medicine, your GP will gradually reduce your dose.\nTo find out more about the possible side effects, check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\nFurther treatment\nFurther specialist treatment may sometimes be necessary if you have tried all the treatments above and your OCD is still not under control.\nSome people with severe, long-term, difficult-to-treat (refractory)\u00a0OCD may be referred to the National Service for Refractory OCD centre.\nThe service offers assessment and treatment to people with OCD who have not responded to treatments available from their local and regional OCD specialist services.\nTo be eligible for this service, you must have been diagnosed as having severe OCD and have received:\n\nat least two full trials of different SSRIs at recommended doses\ntwo trials of unsuccessful CBT treatments both in a clinic and at home\nadditional treatment with a dopamine-blocking agent medication or an SSRI at a dose higher than normally recommended\n\nMost people improve after receiving treatment from the national service.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing.\nThis\u00a0may lead to regularly\u00a0interrupted sleep, which can have a big impact on quality of life and increases the risk of developing certain conditions.\nApnoea and hypopnoea\nThere are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA:\n\napnoea \u2013 where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it's called an apnoea when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more\nhypopnoea \u2013\u00a0a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or more\n\nPeople with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night.\u00a0These events may occur around once every one or two\u00a0minutes in severe cases.\nAs\u00a0many people with OSA experience episodes of both apnoea and hypopnoea, doctors sometimes refer to the condition as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, or OSAHS.\nThe term 'obstructive' distinguishes OSA from rarer forms of sleep apnoea, such as central sleep apnoea, which is caused by the brain not sending\u00a0signals to the breathing muscles during sleep.\nSymptoms of OSA\nThe symptoms of OSA are often first spotted by a partner, friend or family member who notices problems while you sleep.\nSigns of OSA in someone sleeping can include:\n\nloud\u00a0snoring\nnoisy and laboured breathing\nrepeated short periods\u00a0where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snorting\n\nSome people with OSA may also experience\u00a0night sweats and may wake up frequently during the night to urinate.\nDuring an episode, the lack of oxygen\u00a0triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep\u00a0\u2013 either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness\u00a0\u2013\u00a0so your airway reopens and you can breathe normally.\nThese repeated sleep interruptions can make you\u00a0feel very tired during the day. You'll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you\u00a0may be unaware you have a problem.\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee your GP if you think you might have OSA.\nThey\u00a0can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and can arrange for an assessment of your sleep to be carried out through a local sleep centre.\nAs someone with OSA may not notice they have the condition, it often goes undiagnosed.\nRead more about diagnosing OSA.\nCauses of OSA\nIt's normal for the muscles and soft tissues in the throat to relax and collapse to some degree while sleeping. For most people this doesn't cause breathing problems.\nIn people with OSA the airway has narrowed as the result of a number of factors, including:\n\nbeing overweight \u2013\u00a0excessive body fat increases the bulk of soft tissue in the neck, which can place a strain on the throat muscles; excess stomach fat can also lead to breathing difficulties, which can make OSA worse\nbeing male \u2013\u00a0it's not known why OSA is more common in men than in women, but it may be related to different patterns of body fat distribution\nbeing 40 years of age or more \u2013 although OSA can occur at any age, it's more common in people who are over 40\nhaving a large neck \u2013\u00a0men with a collar size greater than around 43cm (17 inches) have an increased risk of developing OSA\ntaking medicines\u00a0with a sedative effect \u2013\u00a0such as sleeping tablets or tranquillisers\nhaving an unusual inner neck structure \u2013 such as a narrow airway, large tonsils, adenoids\u00a0or tongue, or a small lower jaw\nalcohol \u2013\u00a0drinking alcohol, particularly before going\u00a0to sleep,\u00a0can make snoring and sleep apnoea worse\nsmoking \u2013\u00a0you're more likely to develop sleep apnoea if you smoke\nthe menopause (in women) \u2013\u00a0the changes in hormone levels during the menopause may cause the throat muscles to relax more than usual\nhaving a family history of OSA \u2013\u00a0there may be genes inherited from your parents that can make you more susceptible to OSA\nnasal congestion \u2013\u00a0OSA occurs more often in people with nasal congestion, such as a deviated septum, where the tissue in the nose that divides the two nostrils is bent to one side, or nasal polyps, which may be\u00a0a result of the airways being narrowed\n\nTreating OSA\nOSA is a treatable condition, and there\u00a0are a variety of treatment options that can\u00a0reduce the symptoms.\nTreatment options\u00a0for OSA include:\n\nlifestyle changes \u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0losing excess weight, cutting down on alcohol and sleeping on your side\nusing\u00a0a\u00a0continuous\u00a0positive airway pressure (CPAP) device \u2013 these devices\u00a0prevent your airway closing while you sleep by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask\nwearing a\u00a0mandibular advancement device (MAD)\u00a0\u2013 this gum shield-like device fits around your teeth, holding\u00a0your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat while you sleep\n\nSurgery may also be an option if OSA is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically, such as an unusual inner neck structure.\nHowever, for most people surgery isn't appropriate and may only be considered as a last resort if other treatments haven't helped.\nRead more about\u00a0treating OSA.\nComplications of OSA\nThe treatments mentioned above can often help control the symptoms of OSA, although treatment will need to be lifelong in most cases.\nIf OSA is left untreated, it can have a significant impact on your quality of life, causing problems such as\u00a0poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships with others.\nPoorly controlled OSA\u00a0may also\u00a0increase your risk of:\n\ndeveloping high blood pressure (hypertension)\nhaving a\u00a0stroke or heart attack\ndeveloping an irregular heartbeat\u00a0\u2013 such as atrial fibrillation\ndeveloping type 2 diabetes\u00a0\u2013 although it's unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesity\n\nResearch has\u00a0shown someone who has been deprived of sleep because of OSA may be up to 12 times more likely to be involved in a car accident.\nIf you're diagnosed with OSA, it\u00a0may mean your ability to drive is affected. It's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability.\nOnce a diagnosis of OSA has been made, you shouldn't drive until\u00a0your symptoms are well controlled.\nThe GOV.UK website has advice about how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition.\nPreventing OSA\nIt's not always possible to prevent OSA, but making certain lifestyle changes\u00a0may reduce your risk of developing the condition.\nThese include:\n\nlosing weight if you're overweight or obese\nlimiting\u00a0how much alcohol you drink and avoiding alcohol\u00a0in the evening\nstopping smoking if you smoke\navoiding the use of sleeping tablets and tranquillisers\n\n\n\nObstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can usually be diagnosed after you've been observed sleeping at a sleep clinic, or by using a testing device worn overnight at home.\nIf you think you have OSA, it's important to visit your GP in case you need to be referred to a sleep specialist for further tests and treatment.\nBefore seeing your GP it may be helpful to\u00a0ask a partner, friend or relative to observe you while you're asleep, if possible. If you have OSA, they may be able to spot episodes of breathlessness.\nIt may also help to fill out an Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. This\u00a0asks\u00a0how likely you'll be to\u00a0doze off in a number of different situations, such as watching TV or\u00a0sitting in a meeting.\u00a0\nThe final score will help your doctor\u00a0determine whether you may have a sleep disorder.\nFor example,\u00a0a score of 16-24 means you're excessively sleepy and should consider seeking medical attention. A score of eight to nine is considered average during the daytime.\nAn online version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale\u00a0can be found on the British Lung Foundation website.\nSeeing your GP\nWhen you see your GP, they'll usually\u00a0ask a number of questions about your symptoms, such as whether you regularly fall asleep during the day against your will.\nYour blood pressure will be measured and a blood sample probably sent off to help rule out other conditions that could explain your tiredness, such as\u00a0an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\nThe next step is to observe you while you're asleep at a local sleep centre. Your GP can refer you to specialist clinics or hospital departments that help treat people with sleep disorders.\nThe Sleep Apnoea Trust Association has a list of NHS sleep clinics in Scotland.\nObserving your sleep\nThe sleep specialists at the sleep centre may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and carry out a physical examination.\nThis may include measuring your height and weight to work out your body mass index (BMI), as well as measuring\u00a0your neck circumference. This is because being overweight and having a large neck can increase your risk of OSA.\nThe sleep specialists will then arrange for\u00a0your sleep to\u00a0be assessed overnight, either by spending the night at the clinic or taking some monitoring equipment home with you and bringing it back the next day for them to analyse.\nIn many cases the sleep centre will teach you how to use portable recording equipment while you sleep at home.\nThe equipment you are given may include:\n\na breathing sensor\nsensors to monitor your heart rate\nbands that are placed around your chest\noxygen sensors that are put\u00a0on your finger\n\nThe equipment records oxygen\u00a0levels, breathing movements, heart rate and snoring through the night.\nIf more information about sleep quality is required, a more detailed investigation called\u00a0polysomnography\u00a0will be required, which will be carried out at the sleep centre.\nThe main test carried out to analyse your sleep at a sleep centre is known as\u00a0polysomnography.\nDuring the night, several different parts of your body will be carefully monitored while you sleep.\nBands and small metallic discs called electrodes\u00a0are placed on the surface of your skin and\u00a0different parts of your body. Sensors are also placed on your legs and an oxygen sensor will be attached to your finger.\nA number of different tests will be carried out during polysomnography, including:\n\nelectroencephalography (EEG)\u00a0\u2013 this monitors brain waves\nelectromyography (EMG) \u2013 this monitors muscle tone\nrecordings of movements in your chest and abdomen\nrecordings of airflow through your mouth and nose\npulse oximetry \u2013 this measures your heart rate and blood oxygen levels\nelectrocardiography (ECG) \u2013 this monitors your heart\n\nSound recording and video equipment may also be used.\nIf OSA is diagnosed during the early part of the night, you may be given continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. CPAP involves using a mask that delivers constant compressed air to the airway and stops it closing, which prevents OSA.\nRead about treating OSA for more information about CPAP.\nOnce the tests have been completed, staff at the sleep centre should have a good idea about whether or not you have OSA. If you do, they can determine how much it is interrupting your sleep and recommend appropriate treatment.\nDetermining the severity of OSA\nThe severity of OSA is determined by how\u00a0often your breathing is affected over the course of an hour. These episodes are measured using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI).\nSeverity is measured using the following criteria:\n\nmild \u2013\u00a0an AHI reading of 5 to 14 episodes an hour\nmoderate \u2013\u00a0an AHI reading of 15 to 30 episodes an hour\nsevere \u2013\u00a0an AHI reading of more than 30 episodes an hour\n\nCurrent evidence suggests treatment is most likely to be beneficial in people with moderate or severe OSA. However, some research has suggested treatment may also help some people with mild OSA.\n\n\nTreatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may include making lifestyle changes and using breathing apparatus while you sleep.\nOSA is a long-term condition and many cases require lifelong treatment.\nLifestyle changes\nIn\u00a0most cases of\u00a0OSA you'll be advised to make healthy lifestyle changes,\u00a0such\u00a0as:\n\nlosing weight\u00a0if you're overweight or obese\nstopping smoking if you smoke\nlimiting your alcohol consumption, particularly before going to bed\u00a0\u2013 the NHS recommends not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week; if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over three or more days\navoiding\u00a0sedative medications and sleeping tablets\n\nLosing weight, reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and avoiding sedatives\u00a0have all\u00a0been shown to\u00a0help improve the symptoms of OSA.\u00a0\nAlthough it's\u00a0less clear whether stopping smoking can improve the condition,\u00a0you'll probably\u00a0be advised to stop for general health reasons.\nSleeping on your side, rather than on your back, may also help relieve the symptoms of OSA.\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\nAs well as\u00a0the lifestyle changes mentioned above, people with moderate to severe OSA\u00a0usually\u00a0need to\u00a0use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device.\nThis is a small pump\u00a0that\u00a0delivers a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask that\u00a0either covers your nose or your nose and mouth. The compressed air prevents your throat closing.\nCPAP can feel peculiar to start with and\u00a0you may be tempted to stop using it.\u00a0But people who persevere\u00a0usually soon\u00a0get used to\u00a0it and their symptoms improve significantly.\nCPAP is available on the NHS and is the most effective therapy for treating severe cases of OSA.\nAs well as reducing symptoms such as snoring and tiredness, it can also reduce the risk of\u00a0complications of OSA, such as high blood pressure.\nPossible side effects of using a CPAP device can include:\n\nmask discomfort\nnasal congestion, runny nose or irritation\ndifficulty breathing through your nose\nheadaches and ear pain\nstomach pain and flatulence (wind)\n\nEarlier versions of CPAP also often caused problems such as nasal dryness and a sore throat. However, modern versions tend to include humidifiers, a device that increases moisture, which helps reduce these side effects.\nIf CPAP causes you discomfort, inform your treatment staff\u00a0as the device can be modified to make it more comfortable. For example, you can try using a CPAP machine that starts with a low air pressure and gradually builds up to a higher air pressure as you fall asleep.\nMandibular advancement device (MAD)\nA mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a dental appliance, similar to a gum shield, sometimes used to treat mild OSA.\u00a0\nThey're not generally recommended for more severe OSA, although they may be an option if you're unable to tolerate using a CPAP device.\nAn MAD is worn over your teeth when you're asleep. It's designed to hold your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat and reduce the narrowing of your airway that causes snoring.\nOff-the-shelf MADs are available from specialist websites, but most experts don't recommend them, as poor-fitting MADs can make symptoms worse.\nIt's recommended you have an MAD made for you by a dentist with training and experience in treating sleep apnoea. MADs aren't always available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for the device privately through a dentist or orthodontist.\nAn MAD may not be suitable treatment for you if you don't have many\u00a0\u2013 or any\u00a0\u2013\u00a0teeth. If you have dental caps, crowns or bridgework, consult your dentist to ensure they won't be stressed or damaged by an MAD.\nSurgery for OSA\nSurgery to treat OSA isn't routinely recommended because evidence shows it's not as effective as CPAP at controlling the symptoms of the condition. It also carries\u00a0the risk of more serious complications.\nSurgery is usually only considered as a last resort when all other treatment options have failed, and also if the condition\u00a0is severely affecting your quality of life.\nA\u00a0range of surgical treatments\u00a0have been used to treat OSA. These include:\n\ntonsillectomy \u2013 where the tonsils are removed if they're enlarged and blocking your airway when you sleep\nadenoidectomy\u00a0\u2013 where the adenoids, small lumps of tissue\u00a0at the back of the throat above the tonsils, are removed if they're enlarged and are blocking the airway during sleep\ntracheostomy\u00a0\u2013 where a tube is inserted directly into your neck to allow you to breathe freely, even if the airways in your upper throat are blocked\nweight loss (bariatric) surgery\u00a0\u2013 where the size of the stomach is reduced if you're severely obese and\u00a0this is making your sleep apnoea\u00a0worse\n\nSurgery to\u00a0remove excess tissue in the throat to widen your airway (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty) used to be a common surgical treatment for OSA, but it's performed less often nowadays.\nThis is\u00a0because more effective treatments are available, such as CPAP. This type of surgery can mean you're unable to use a CPAP device properly in the future if you need to.\nSoft palate implants\nSoft palate implants make the soft palate, part of the roof of the mouth, stiffer and less likely to vibrate and cause an obstruction. The implants are inserted into the soft palate under local anaesthetic.\nThe National Institute\u00a0for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said soft palate implants are safe, but they're not currently recommended for treating OSA\u00a0as there's a lack of evidence about their effectiveness.\nHowever, this form of treatment is recommended for treating snoring associated with OSA in exceptional cases.\nSupport groups\nOSA can have a significant impact on the quality of life for someone with the condition, as well as their friends and families.\nAs well as causing physical problems such as tiredness and headaches, the condition can have a significant emotional impact and affect your relationships with others.\nFor support and advice about living with OSA, you may find it helpful to contact a support group, such as:\n\nBritish Lung Foundation\nSleep Apnoea Trust\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Oesophageal cancer is a type of cancer affecting the oesophagus (gullet) \u2013 the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach.\nIt mainly affects people in their 60s and 70s and is more common in men than women.\nSymptoms of oesophageal cancer\nOesophageal cancer doesn't usually cause any symptoms in the early stages when the tumour is small.

This is called Barrett's oesophagus.\nThese abnormal cells are at an increased risk of becoming cancerous in the future, although the risk is still small.\u00a0It's estimated that 1 in every 10\u00a0to 20 people with Barrett's oesophagus will develop cancer within 10 to 20 years.\nAlcohol\nDrinking too much alcohol\u00a0causes irritation and inflammation in the lining of the oesophagus.\nIf the cells in the lining of your gullet become inflamed,\u00a0they're more likely to become cancerous.\nRead more about\u00a0alcohol and drinking, including tips on cutting down\nSmoking\nTobacco smoke contains many harmful toxins and chemicals.

This will usually be a gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions affecting the digestive system).\nTests to diagnose oesophageal cancer\nThe 2 main tests used to\u00a0diagnose oesophageal cancer are:\n\nan\u00a0endoscopy\u00a0\u2013 this is the most common test\na barium swallow or barium meal\n\nEndoscopy\nAn endoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to see inside your oesophagus so they can check for\u00a0cancer.\nA\u00a0thin, flexible\u00a0tube with a\u00a0light and camera at the end\u00a0(an endoscope) is passed into your mouth and down towards your stomach.\nSmall samples of tissue are also removed from\u00a0your oesophagus so they can be checked for cancer under a microscope. This is called a biopsy.\nYou'll be awake while\u00a0an endoscopy is carried out. It shouldn't be painful, but may be a bit uncomfortable.\nYou'll normally be given local anaesthetic\u00a0to numb your throat\u00a0and possibly a\u00a0sedative to help you relax.\nBarium swallow\u00a0or barium meal\nA barium swallow or barium meal involves drinking a harmless white liquid called barium before several\u00a0X-rays\u00a0are taken.\nThe barium coats the lining of your oesophagus so it shows up on the X-ray. This can show whether there's anything blocking\u00a0your oesophagus, which may be a sign of cancer.\nThis test isn't used to diagnose oesophageal cancer very often nowadays because the best way to confirm a diagnosis is to use tissue samples taken during an endoscopy.\nFurther tests\nIf\u00a0you have oesophageal cancer, further tests will\u00a0be\u00a0recommended to determine how far the cancer has spread\u00a0\u2013 known as called the 'stage'.\u00a0\nThese tests may include:\n\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 where a series of X-rays are taken and put together by a computer to create a detailed picture of the inside of your body\nan endoscopic ultrasound scan\u00a0\u2013 where a small probe\u00a0that produces sound waves is passed down your throat to create an image of your oesophagus and the surrounding area\na positron emission tomography (PET) scan\u00a0\u2013 a scan that can help show how far the cancer has spread\na\u00a0laparoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a type of keyhole surgery performed under general anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're asleep), in which a thin tube with a camera at the end is inserted through a cut in your skin to examine the area around your oesophagus\n\nStages of oesophageal cancer\nThe most widely used system for staging oesophageal cancer is the TNM system. This involves scoring the cancer in 3 categories:\n\nT (tumour) \u2013 the location and size of the tumour\nN (node) \u2013 whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (a network of glands throughout the body)\nM (metastasis) \u2013 whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver or bones\n\nScores for each\u00a0category are then often used in a simpler number system, ranging from stage 1 (early cancer) to stage 4 (advanced cancer).\nKnowing the stage of your cancer will help your\u00a0care team\u00a0work out the best treatment for you.\nRead more about treatments for oesophageal cancer\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK:\u00a0diagnosing oesophageal cancer\nCancer Research UK:\u00a0stages and grades of oesophageal cancer\nMacmillan:\u00a0how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed\nMacmillan:\u00a0staging oesophageal cancer\n\n\n\nThe main treatments for oesophageal cancer are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nYour treatment plan\nYou'll be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals and your team will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you,\u00a0although final treatment decisions will be yours.\nYour plan will largely depend on how far your cancer has spread\u00a0\u2013 known as the 'stage'.\n\nstage 1 to 3 oesophageal cancer is usually treated\u00a0with surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus\u00a0(oesophagectomy) \u2013 chemotherapy and sometimes radiotherapy may be given before surgery to make it more effective or is sometimes used instead of surgery\nstage 4 oesophageal cancer has usually spread too far for a cure to be possible, but chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other treatments can slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms\n\nRead more about the stages of oesophageal cancer\nSurgery\nThere are 3 main types of surgery for oesophageal cancer.\nAn oesophagectomy is the\u00a0main treatment for early-stage oesophageal cancer.\nDuring the procedure, your surgeon will remove the section of your oesophagus that contains the tumour and, if necessary, the nearby lymph nodes.\u00a0A small portion of your stomach may also need to be removed.\nThe remaining section of your oesophagus\u00a0is then\u00a0reconnected to your stomach.\nTo access your oesophagus, your surgeon will either make incisions (cuts) in your\u00a0tummy and chest, or in your\u00a0tummy and neck.\nA procedure called\u00a0endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)\u00a0may sometimes be an option instead of\u00a0an oesophagectomy if oesophageal cancer is diagnosed very early on.\nIt involves\u00a0cutting out\u00a0the tumour using a loop of wire at the end of a thin flexible tube (endoscope). The endoscope is passed down your throat so no incisions are made in your skin.\nSometimes radiowaves may also be used to destroy the cancerous tissue (called radiofrequency ablation or RFA).\nFor more advanced cases of oesophageal cancer that are causing swallowing difficulties,\u00a0a procedure to insert a hollow tube called a stent into the oesophagus may be recommended.\nThe stent expands once in place and holds the oesophagus open.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0involves taking medicines that kill the cancer cells or stop them multiplying.\nIt may be used:\n\nbefore and sometimes after surgery, either\u00a0with or without radiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 to shrink the cancer and reduce the\u00a0risk of it coming back\ninstead of surgery\u00a0\u2013 in\u00a0combination with radiotherapy (called chemoradiation)\nto relieve your symptoms if\u00a0curative treatment\u00a0isn't possible\n\nThe medicines can be\u00a0given into a vein\u00a0or taken as tablets. You'll usually have the treatment\u00a0every 3 weeks\u00a0over a\u00a0period of\u00a06\u00a0to 18 weeks.\nCommon side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\nfeeling sick\nloss of appetite\nlosing weight\ndiarrhoea\nfeeling very tired\nincreased risk of\u00a0infections\nbleeding and bruising easily\n\nThese side effects should improve gradually after treatment stops.\u00a0\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0involves using\u00a0radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours.\nIt may be used:\n\nin combination with chemotherapy before surgery\u00a0\u2013 to shrink the cancer and reduce the\u00a0risk of it coming back\ninstead of surgery\u00a0\u2013 usually in combination with chemotherapy (called chemoradiation)\nto relieve\u00a0your symptoms if curative treatment isn't possible\n\nRadiotherapy is most often given using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at your oesophagus, or sometimes by temporarily placing a small piece of radioactive material in your oesophagus (brachytherapy).\nCommon side effects of radiotherapy include:\n\ntiredness\ntemporary soreness when swallowing\ntemporary worsening of swallowing difficulties\na dry throat\nfeeling or being sick\nreddening of the skin and loss of body hair in the treatment area\n\nThese side effects should improve gradually after treatment stops.\u00a0\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK:\u00a0treatments for oesophageal cancer\nMacmillan:\u00a0treatments for oesophageal cancer\n\n\n\nHaving oesophageal cancer can have a big impact on your life, but support is available to help you cope.\nEating and swallowing\nYou may have\u00a0swallowing difficulties\u00a0during and after treatment for oesophageal cancer.\nThere are treatments that can help \u2013 including surgery to place a hollow tube (stent) in your oesophagus,\u00a0or a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 although they may not work immediately.\nYou might need to have a temporary feeding tube placed or fluids given through a drip inserted in a vein to begin with, before moving onto fluids by mouth and soft foods.

It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture.\nThe most common injuries\u00a0in people with osteoporosis are:\n\nwrist fractures\nhip fractures\nfractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae)\n\nHowever, they can also occur in other bones, such as in\u00a0the arm or pelvis.\u00a0Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine.\nOsteoporosis\u00a0isn't usually painful until a fracture occurs,\u00a0but spinal fractures\u00a0are a common cause of\u00a0long-term (chronic) pain.\nAlthough a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis,\u00a0some older people develop\u00a0the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine\u00a0have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body.\nWho's affected?\nOsteoporosis affects over three million people in the UK.\nMore than\u00a0500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis.\nCauses of osteoporosis\nLosing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.\nWomen also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the menopause (when\u00a0monthly\u00a0periods\u00a0stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45).\nMany other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including:\n\nlong-term use of high-dose\u00a0oral corticosteroids\nother medical\u00a0conditions\u00a0\u2013 such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems\na family history of osteoporosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent\nlong-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels\nhaving a low\u00a0body mass index (BMI)\nheavy drinking and smoking\n\nRead more about the causes of osteoporosis.\nDiagnosing osteoporosis\nIf your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an\u00a0online programme, such as\u00a0FRAX or Q-Fracture.\nThese tools help to predict\u00a0a person's risk of fracture between the ages of\u00a040 and 90.\u00a0The algorithms\u00a0used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a\u00a0major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm.\nThey may also refer you\u00a0for a DEXA (DXA) scan\u00a0to measure your bone mineral density. It's a short, painless procedure that takes\u00a0about\u00a0five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned.\nYour bone mineral density\u00a0can be\u00a0compared\u00a0to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult and someone who's the same age and sex as you.\u00a0The difference is\u00a0calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called\u00a0a T score.\nStandard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of:\n\nabove -1 SD\u00a0is\u00a0normal\u00a0\nbetween -1 and -2.5 SD\u00a0is defined as decreased bone mineral density compared with\u00a0peak bone mass\nbelow -2.5 is\u00a0defined as osteoporosis\n\nOsteopenia\nYou may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased\u00a0bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis.\nYour doctor may still recommend some of the treatments described below,\u00a0depending on your results and your risk of fracture.\nTreating osteoporosis\nTreatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing fractures, and using medication to strengthen bones.\nThe decision about whether you need\u00a0treatment depends on your risk of fracture. This will be\u00a0based on a number of factors\u00a0such as your age, sex\u00a0and the results of your DEXA scan.\nIf you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you.\nRead more\u00a0about how osteoporosis is treated.\nPreventing osteoporosis\nIf you're at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should\u00a0take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include:\n\ntaking\u00a0regular exercise\nhealthy eating\u00a0\u2013 including\u00a0foods rich in calcium and vitamin\u00a0D\nmaking lifestyle changes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0giving up smoking and reducing your\u00a0alcohol consumption\n\nRead more about preventing osteoporosis.\nLiving with osteoporosis\nIf you're diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take\u00a0to reduce your chances of a fall, such as\u00a0removing hazards from your home and having regular\u00a0sight tests and hearing tests.\nTo help you recover from a fracture, you can try using:\n\nhot and cold\u00a0treatments\u00a0such as warm baths and cold packs\ntranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a small battery-operated device is used to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain\nrelaxation techniques\n\nSpeak to your GP or nurse if you're worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have.\nYou may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people\u00a0with the condition.\nThe\u00a0Royal Osteoporosis Society can put you in touch with\u00a0local support groups.\nRead more about living with osteoporosis.\n\n\nOsteoporosis causes bones to become less dense and more fragile. Some people are more at risk than others.\nBones are at their thickest and strongest in your early adult life and their density increases until your late 20s. You gradually start losing bone density\u00a0from around the age of\u00a035.\nThis happens\u00a0to everyone, but some people\u00a0develop osteoporosis and lose bone density much faster than normal. This means they're at greater risk of a fracture.\nRisk groups\nOsteoporosis can affect men and women.\u00a0It's more common in older people, but it can also affect younger people.\nWomen are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than men because\u00a0the hormone changes that occur in the menopause directly affect bone density.\nThe female hormone oestrogen is essential for healthy bones. After the menopause\u00a0(when monthly\u00a0periods stop), oestrogen levels fall. This can\u00a0lead to a rapid decrease in bone density.\nWomen are at even greater risk of developing osteoporosis if they have:\n\nan\u00a0early menopause (before the age of 45)\na\u00a0hysterectomy (removal of the womb) before the age of 45, particularly when the ovaries are also removed\nabsent periods\u00a0for more than six months as a result of overexercising or too much dieting\n\nIn most cases, the cause of\u00a0osteoporosis in men is unknown. However, there's a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps keep the bones healthy.\nMen continue producing\u00a0testosterone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in\u00a0men with low levels of testosterone.\nIn around half of men, the exact cause of low testosterone levels\u00a0is unknown, but known causes include:\n\nthe use of certain medications, such as oral corticosteroids\nalcohol misuse\nhypogonadism\u00a0(a condition that causes abnormally low testosterone levels)\n\nRisk factors\nMany hormones in the body can affect the process of bone turnover. If you have a condition\u00a0of the hormone-producing glands, you may have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis.\nHormone-related conditions that can trigger osteoporosis include:\n\nhyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)\ndisorders of the adrenal glands, such as\u00a0Cushing's syndrome\nreduced\u00a0amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone)\ndisorders of the pituitary gland\nhyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands)\n\nOther factors thought to\u00a0increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include:\n\na family history of osteoporosis\na parental history of\u00a0hip fracture\u00a0\na\u00a0body mass index (BMI) of 19 or less\nlong-term use of high-dose\u00a0oral corticosteroids (widely used for conditions such as\u00a0arthritis and asthma), which can affect bone strength\nhaving an eating disorder, such as\u00a0anorexia or bulimia\nheavy drinking and smoking\nrheumatoid arthritis\u00a0\nmalabsorption problems, as experienced in\u00a0coeliac disease and\u00a0Crohn's disease\nsome medications used to treat\u00a0breast cancer and\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0which affect hormone levels\nlong periods of inactivity, such as long-term bed rest\n\nYou can read more about\u00a0who's at risk of osteoporosis and broken bones on the\u00a0Royal Osteoporosis Society website.\n\n\nTreatment overview\nAlthough a diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on the results of your bone mineral density scan (DEXA or DXA scan), the decision about what treatment you need\u00a0\u2013 if any \u2013\u00a0is also based on a number of other factors. These include your:\n\nage\nsex\nrisk of fracture\nprevious injury history\n\nIf you've been diagnosed with osteoporosis because you've had a fracture, you should still receive treatment to try to reduce your risk of further fractures.\nYou may not need or want to take medication to treat osteoporosis. However, you should ensure you're maintaining sufficient\u00a0levels of calcium and\u00a0vitamin D. To achieve this, your healthcare team will ask you about your diet and may recommend making changes or taking supplements.\nNICE recommendations\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u00a0has made some recommendations about who should be treated with medication for osteoporosis.\nA\u00a0number of factors are taken into consideration before deciding which medication to use. These include your:\n\nage\nbone mineral density (measured by your T score)\nrisk factors for fracture\n\nNICE has summarised its guidance for two groups of people:\n\npostmenopausal women with osteoporosis who haven't had a fracture (primary prevention)\npostmenopausal women with osteoporosis who have had a fracture (secondary prevention)\n\nYou can read the NICE guidance by clicking on the links below.\n\nNICE guidance:\u00a0Alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and strontium ranelate for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility\u00a0fractures in postmenopausal women\u00a0\nNICE guidance:\u00a0Alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate and teriparatide for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women\n\nMedication for osteoporosis\nA\u00a0number of different medications are used to treat osteoporosis. Your doctor will discuss the treatments available and\u00a0make sure the medicines are right for you.\nBisphosphonates slow down the rate at which bone is broken down in your body. This maintains bone density and reduces the risk of fracture.\nThere are a number of different bisphosphonates, including\n\nalendronate\netidronate\nibandronate\nrisedronate\nzolendronic acid\n\nThey're given as a tablet or\u00a0injection.\nYou should always take bisphosphonates\u00a0on an empty stomach with a full glass of water. Stand or sit upright for 30 minutes after taking them. You'll also need to wait between 30 minutes and two hours before eating food or drinking any other fluids.\nBisphosphonates usually take 6 to 12 months to work and you may need to take them\u00a0for five years or\u00a0longer. You may also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplements to take at a different time to the bisphosphonate.\nThe main side effects associated with bisphosphonates include:\n\nirritation to the oesophagus (the tube that food passes through from the mouth to the stomach)\nswallowing problems (dysphagia)\nstomach pain\n\nNot everyone will experience these side effects.\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw is a\u00a0rare side effect that's linked with the use of bisphosphonates, although\u00a0most frequently with high-dose intravenous bisphosphonate treatment for cancer\u00a0and not for osteoporosis.\nIn\u00a0osteonecrosis, the cells in the jaw bone die, which can lead to problems with healing. If you have a history of dental problems, you may need a check-up before you start treatment with bisphosphonates. Speak to your doctor if you have any concerns.\nStrontium ranelate appears to have an effect on both the cells\u00a0that break down bone and the cells\u00a0that create new bone (osteoblasts).\nIt can be used as an alternative treatment if bisphosphonates are unsuitable. Strontium ranelate is taken as a powder dissolved in water.\nThe main side effects of strontium ranelate are nausea and diarrhoea. A few people have reported a rare severe allergic reaction to the treatment. If you develop a skin rash while taking strontium ralenate, stop taking it and speak to your doctor immediately.\nSERMs are medications that have a similar effect on bone as the hormone oestrogen. They help to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture, particularly of the spine.\nRaloxifene is the only type\u00a0of SERM that's available for treating osteoporosis. It's taken as a tablet every day.\nSide effects associated with raloxifene include:\n\nhot flushes\nleg cramps\na potential increased risk of blood clots\n\nParathyroid hormone is produced naturally in the body.\u00a0It regulates the amount of calcium in bone.\nParathyroid hormone treatments (human recombinant parathyroid hormone or teriparatide) are used to stimulate cells that create new bone (osteoblasts). They're given by injection.\nWhile\u00a0other medication\u00a0can only slow down the rate of bone thinning, parathyroid hormone can increase bone density. However, it's only used in a small number of people whose bone density is very low and when other treatments aren't working.\nNausea and vomiting are common side effects of the treatment. Parathyroid hormone treatments should only be prescribed by a specialist.\nCalcium\u00a0is the major mineral found in bone, and having enough calcium as part of a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet is important for maintaining healthy bones.\nFor most healthy adults, the recommended amount of calcium is 700 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day, which most people should be able to get from a varied diet that contains good sources of calcium.\nHowever, if you have osteoporosis you may need more calcium, which will usually be in the form of supplements. Ask your GP for advice about taking calcium supplements.\nVitamin D\u00a0is needed to help the body absorb calcium. It's difficult to get enough vitamin D from your diet alone because few foods contain vitamin D. In the UK, most healthy adults obtain vitamin D from exposing the skin to summer sunlight.\nHowever, for people at risk of not getting enough vitamin D, supplementation with 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day (400 international units [IU]) is\u00a0recommended to prevent deficiency.\nAt-risk groups include people over 65 years of age,\u00a0and people who aren't exposed to much sunlight because they cover their skin for cultural reasons, are housebound, or who stay indoors for long periods.\nIf you're found to lack vitamin D, your GP may prescribe supplements at a higher dose than the above recommendation to correct the deficiency.\nHRT is sometimes recommended for women who are experiencing the menopause, as it can help control symptoms.\nHRT has also been shown to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture during treatment.\nHowever, HRT isn't specifically recommended for treating osteoporosis and it isn't often used for this purpose.\nThis is because HRT slightly increases\u00a0the risk\u00a0of developing certain conditions, such as breast cancer, endometrial cancer,\u00a0ovarian cancer, stroke\u00a0and venous thromboembolism more than it lowers the risk of osteoporosis.\nDiscuss the benefits and risks of HRT with your GP.\nRead more about the\u00a0risks of HRT.\nIn men, testosterone treatment can be useful when osteoporosis is caused by insufficient production of male sex hormones (hypogonadism).\n\n\nYour genes are responsible for determining your height and the strength of your skeleton, but lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise influence how healthy your bones are.\nRegular exercise\nRegular exercise\u00a0is essential.\u00a0Adults aged 19 to 64 should do\u00a0at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as\u00a0cycling or fast walking, every week.\nWeight-bearing exercise and resistance exercise are particularly important for improving bone density and helping to prevent osteoporosis.\nAs well as aerobic exercise, adults aged 19 to 64 should also do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week by\u00a0working all the major muscle groups, including the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, arms and shoulders.\nIf you've been diagnosed with osteoporosis, it's a good idea to talk to your GP or health specialist before starting a new exercise programme to make sure it's right for you.\nRead more about the physical activity guidelines for adults.\nWeight-bearing exercises\nWeight-bearing exercises are exercises where your feet and legs support your weight. High-impact weight-bearing exercises, such as running, skipping, dancing, aerobics, and even jumping up and down on the spot, are all useful ways to strengthen your muscles, ligaments and joints.\nWhen exercising,\u00a0wear footwear that provides your ankles and feet with adequate support, such as trainers or walking boots.\nPeople\u00a0over the age of 60 can also benefit from regular weight-bearing exercise. This can include brisk walking, keep-fit classes or a game of tennis. Swimming and cycling aren't weight-bearing exercises, however.\nRead more about physical activity guidelines for older adults.\nResistance exercises\nResistance exercises use muscle strength, where the action of the tendons pulling on the bones boosts bone strength. Examples include press-ups, weightlifting or using weight equipment at a gym.\nIf you've recently joined a gym or\u00a0haven't been for a while, your gym will probably offer you an induction. This involves being shown how to use the equipment and having exercise techniques recommended to you.\nAlways ask an instructor for help if you're not sure how to use a piece of gym equipment or how to do a particular\u00a0exercise.\nHealthy eating\nEating a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet is recommended for everyone. It can help prevent many serious health conditions, including heart disease,\u00a0diabetes and many forms of cancer, as well as osteoporosis.\nCalcium\u00a0is important\u00a0for maintaining strong bones. Adults need 700mg a day, which you\u00a0should be able to get from your daily diet. Calcium-rich foods include:\n\nleafy green vegetables\ndried fruit\ntofu\nyoghurt\n\nVitamin D\u00a0is also important for healthy bones and teeth because\u00a0it helps your body absorb calcium. Vitamin D can be found in:\n\neggs\nmilk\noily fish\n\nHowever, most vitamin D is made in the skin in response to sunlight. Short exposure to sunlight without wearing\u00a0sunscreen (10 minutes twice a day) throughout the summer should provide you with enough vitamin D for the whole year.\nCertain groups of people may be at risk of not getting enough vitamin D. These include:\n\npeople who are housebound or particularly frail\npeople with a poor diet\npeople who keep covered up in sunlight because they wear total sun block or adhere to a certain dress code\nwomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n\nIf you're at risk of not getting enough vitamin D through your diet or lifestyle, you can take a vitamin D supplement. For adults, 10 micrograms a day of vitamin D is recommended.\nThe recommended amount for children is 7 micrograms for babies under six months, and 8.5 micrograms for children aged six months to three years.\u00a0Talk to your GP for more information.\nRead more\u00a0about healthy eating.\nOther factors\nOther lifestyle factors that can help prevent osteoporosis include:\n\nquitting smoking\u00a0\u2013\u00a0smoking is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis\nlimiting your alcohol intake \u2013 the NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week; it's also important to avoid binge drinking\n\nRead more about\u00a0healthy bones\u00a0on the\u00a0National Osteoporosis Society website.\n\n\nGetting support\nYour GP or nurse may be able to answer\u00a0any questions you have about living with osteoporosis and\u00a0can reassure you if you're worried.\nYou may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or to someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have information about these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to others with osteoporosis, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room.\nOsteoporosis support\nThe\u00a0Royal Osteoporosis Society provides\u00a0a helpline service run by nurses with specialist knowledge of osteoporosis and bone health.\nCall 0808 800 0035. You can also email them at\u00a0nurses@theros.org.uk.\nThey can provide you with details of\u00a0local support groups.\nRecovering from a broken bone\nBroken bones usually take six to eight weeks to recover. Having osteoporosis doesn't affect how long this takes. Recovery depends on the type of fracture you have. Some fractures heal easily, while others may\u00a0need more intervention.\nIf you have a complicated\u00a0wrist fracture or hip fracture, you may need an operation to make sure the bone is set properly.\u00a0Hip replacements are often needed\u00a0after hip fractures, and some people may lose mobility as a result of weakened bones.\nOsteoporosis can cause a loss of height due to fractures in the spinal column. This means the spine is no longer able to support your body's weight and causes a hunched posture.\nThis can be painful when it occurs, but it may also lead to\u00a0long-term (chronic)\u00a0pain. Your GP or nurse may be able to help with this.\nDuring the healing process, you may need the help of a physiotherapist or occupational therapist so you can make as full a recovery as possible.\nRead more about occupational therapy.\nCoping with pain\nEveryone experiences pain differently, so what works for you may differ from what works for someone else.\nThere are different ways to manage pain, including:\n\nmedication\u00a0\nheat treatment,\u00a0such as\u00a0warm baths or hot packs\u00a0\ncold treatment,\u00a0such as\u00a0cold packs\ntranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)\u00a0\u2013 this is thought to reduce pain by stimulating the nerves\u00a0\nsimple relaxation techniques,\u00a0massage or hypnosis\n\nYou can use more than one of these techniques at the same time\u00a0to manage your pain\u00a0\u2013 for example, you could combine medication, a heat pack and relaxation techniques.\nWorking and money\nYou should be able to continue working if\u00a0you have osteoporosis. It's very important that you remain physically active and have a fulfilled lifestyle.\nThis will help keep your bones healthy and stop you focusing too much on your potential health problems. However, if your work involves the risk of falling or breaking a bone, seek advice from your employer,\u00a0GP and the Royal Osteoporosis Society about how to limit your risk of having an accident or injury that could lead to a bone break.\nIf you can't continue working, you may be eligible for the Personal Independence Payment. People over 65 who are severely disabled may qualify for a disability benefit called Attendance Allowance.\nHelp for carers\nYou may also be entitled to certain benefits if you care for someone with osteoporosis.\nRead more about benefits for carers.\nMore information\n\nCare Information Scotland\nGOV.UK: Carers and disability benefits\nMoney Advice Service\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Otitis externa is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the external ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and eardrum.\nOtitis externa is often referred to as \"swimmer's ear\" because\u00a0repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation.\nSymptoms of otitis externa include:\n\near pain, which can be severe\nitchiness in the ear canal\na discharge of liquid or pus from the ear\nsome degree of temporary hearing loss\n\nUsually only one ear is affected.\nWith treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days.

However, don't attempt to squeeze\u00a0any pimples or boils in your ear, as\u00a0this could lead to the infection spreading elsewhere.\nLong-term symptoms\nIn some cases,\u00a0the symptoms of otitis externa can persist for several months, or sometimes years. This is known as chronic otitis externa.\nSymptoms\u00a0of\u00a0chronic otitis externa can include:\n\na constant itch in and around your ear canal\ndiscomfort and pain in your ear\u00a0that becomes worse when you move it\u00a0\u2013 this is usually much milder than in\u00a0short-term otitis externa\na thin, watery discharge from your ear\na lack of earwax\na build-up of thick, dry skin in your ear canal, known as stenosis, which can narrow your ear canal and affect your hearing\n\n\n\nThere are several different causes of otitis externa. A number of things can also increase your chance of developing the condition.\nCommon causes\nCauses of otitis externa can include:\n\na bacterial infection \u2013 usually by\u00a0bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa or\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus\nseborrheic\u00a0dermatitis \u2013\u00a0a common skin condition where the naturally greasy areas of your skin become irritated and inflamed, which can sometimes affect the ears\na\u00a0middle ear infection (otitis media)\u00a0\u2013 discharge produced by an infection\u00a0deeper in the ear can sometimes lead to otitis externa\na fungal infection \u2013 such as\u00a0from the Aspergillus variety and the Candida albicans variety (which also causes thrush); fungal infections are more common if you\u00a0use antibacterial or steroid ear drops for a long time\nirritation or an allergic reaction \u2013 otitis\u00a0externa can occur because of a reaction to something that comes into contact with your ears, such as ear medication, ear plugs, shampoo or sweat\n\nOtitis externa can also return after previous treatment if you don't complete the full course of recommended treatment.\nPossible triggers\nThe following things\u00a0aren't direct causes of otitis externa, but may make the condition more likely to develop.\nLiquid in your ear canal can make you more likely to develop an infection.\u00a0Moisture provides an ideal environment for bacteria\u00a0\u2013 and to a lesser degree, fungi\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to grow.\nYour risk may be increased by:\n\nswimming\u00a0\u2013\u00a0particularly in dirty or polluted water\nsweating\nbeing exposed to humid environments\n\nWater can also wash away earwax inside your ears, which can\u00a0make them itchy.\nYour ear canal is very sensitive and\u00a0may become damaged through:\n\nscratching inside your ears\nexcessive cleaning\ninserting cotton buds\nwearing ear plugs or in-ear headphones for long periods\n\nUsing\u00a0a hearing aid may also increase your risk of developing otitis externa.\nYour chances of getting otitis externa are increased if you use certain products in or near your ears, such as:\n\nhair sprays\nhair dyes\nearwax softeners\n\nAs well as\u00a0seborrheic dermatitis,\u00a0certain underlying skin conditions can\u00a0increase your risk of\u00a0otitis externa. These include:\u00a0\n\npsoriasis\neczema\nacne\n\nIf you have\u00a0allergic rhinitis or asthma, you may be at a higher risk of developing otitis externa.\nYou may be at higher risk of developing otitis externa if you have a condition that can weaken your immune system, such as:\n\ndiabetes\nHIV or AIDS\n\nCertain cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, may also increase your risk of otitis externa.\n\n\nOtitis externa can usually be treated effectively with ear drops prescribed by your GP and some simple self-care techniques.\nIn most cases, your symptoms will start to improve within a few days of starting treatment.\nIf\u00a0your symptoms are severe or they fail to respond to initial treatment, your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice.\nManaging your symptoms at home\nThe advice below should help to relieve your\u00a0symptoms to some extent and help to prevent complications:\n\navoid getting your affected ear wet\u00a0\u2013\u00a0wearing a shower cap while showering and bathing can help, but you should\u00a0avoid swimming until the condition has fully cleared\nremove any discharge or debris by gently swabbing your outer ear with cotton wool, being careful not to damage it\u00a0\u2013 don't stick cotton wool or a cotton bud inside your ear\nremove anything from your affected ear that may cause an allergic reaction, such as hearing aids, ear plugs and earrings\nuse painkillers such as\u00a0paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve ear pain\u00a0\u2013\u00a0these aren't suitable for everyone, so make sure you check the information leaflet that comes with the medication first; if you're still\u00a0unsure, check with your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist\nif your condition is caused by a boil\u00a0in your ear, placing a warm flannel or cloth over the affected ear can help it heal faster\n\nTreatments your GP can provide\nWhile otitis externa can clear up by itself, this can take several weeks without treatment. Your GP can usually prescribe medicated ear drops that speed up the healing process. These usually need to be taken several times a day for about a week.\nThere are four main types of ear drops used to treat otitis externa:\n\nantibiotic ear drops\u00a0\u2013 this can treat an underlying bacterial infection\ncorticosteroid\u00a0ear drops \u2013\u00a0this\u00a0can help to reduce swelling\nantifungal ear drops\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can treat an underlying fungal infection\nacidic ear drops \u2013\u00a0this can help kill bacteria\n\nSometimes you may be given medication that's a combination of the above, such as antibiotic and corticosteroid ear drops.\nOnce treatment is complete and the inflammation has settled, your doctor may want to re-examine your ear to check for any underlying physical problems that could have contributed to the condition, such as having an abnormal or perforated (torn) ear drum.\nEar drops may not work as well if they're not used in the right way, so it's important to apply them correctly. Ideally, ask somebody else to apply the drops for you, as this makes the process much easier.\nYou (or your helper) will need to follow these steps:\n\ngently remove any discharge, earwax or debris from your outer ear using a twist of cotton wool\nwarm the ear drops by holding them in your hands for a few minutes, as cold ear drops can make you feel dizzy\nlie on your side with your affected ear facing up before applying the drops directly into your external ear canal\ngently push and pull your ear for about 30 seconds to work the drops in and get any trapped air out\nstay lying down for three to five\u00a0minutes, to ensure the ear drops don't come out of your ear canal\nleave the ear canal open to dry\n\nIf necessary, there are some other treatments your GP can provide to help treat otitis externa, such as:\n\nstronger prescription painkillers such as codeine for severe cases\nantibiotic tablets or capsules to treat a severe infection \u2013 an antibiotic called flucloxacillin is usually the preferred choice\ntreatment for\u00a0underlying skin conditions that may aggravate your otitis externa, such as\u00a0seborrheic dermatitis,\u00a0psoriasis or eczema\nif a boil develops inside your ear, your GP may decide to pierce it with a sterile needle and drain the pus \u2013 this is known as incision and drainage,\u00a0and you shouldn't\u00a0attempt to do\u00a0it yourself\n\nSpecialist treatment\nIf necessary, your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment.\nThe specialist may decide\u00a0to remove earwax from inside your ears\u00a0to help make ear drops more effective. This can be done in a number of ways:\n\nsyringing or irrigation \u2013 where water is injected through the nozzle of a syringe into the ear canal to dislodge and wash away any earwax\nmicro suction \u2013 where a small suction device is used to remove any earwax, discharge and debris from your outer ear and ear canal\ndry swabbing \u2013 this gently mops out earwax from your ear canal\n\nYou may also need an ear wick, which is a soft cotton gauze plug covered with medication and inserted into your ear canal.\nAn ear wick allows the medication to reach the end of your ear canal. It should be changed every two to three\u00a0days.\n\n\nAlthough complications associated with otitis externa are uncommon, there's a small risk of further problems developing.\nSome of the main complications of otitis externa are described below.\nAbscesses\nAbscesses are painful,\u00a0pus-filled growths that can form in and around\u00a0the affected ear\u00a0after an\u00a0infection.\nThey usually heal on their own, but in some cases your GP may need to drain the pus from them.\nNarrowing of the ear canal\nIf you have long-term (chronic) otitis externa, thick and dry skin can build up inside your ear canal.\nThis causes the ear canal to narrow (stenosis), which may affect your hearing and, in rare cases, can even cause deafness. However, it can usually be treated with ear drops.\nInflamed or perforated eardrum\nIt's possible for\u00a0any\u00a0infection to spread to your eardrum. In some cases, the infection may cause pus to build up inside your inner ear and may rupture (tear) your eardrum. This is known as a perforated eardrum.\nSymptoms include:\n\ntemporary hearing loss\nearache\u00a0or discomfort\na discharge of mucus from your ear\nringing or buzzing in your ear (tinnitus)\n\nIn many cases, a perforated eardrum heals without treatment in a couple of months. Surgery may be recommended if it shows no signs of healing after this time.\nCellulitis\nCellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that can occur after otitis externa. It's what happens when bacteria that\u00a0normally live harmlessly on the surface of your skin enter your skin's deeper layers through damaged areas, such as those caused by otitis externa.\nCellulitis causes affected areas of skin to become red, painful, hot and tender to the touch.\nOther symptoms include:\n\nfeeling sick\nshivering\nchills\na general sense of feeling unwell\n\nMost cases of cellulitis can be treated with a seven-day course of antibiotics.\nIf cellulitis occurs in a person who was already very ill or who is very vulnerable to the effects of infection, they may need to be admitted to hospital as a precaution.\nNecrotizing\u00a0otitis externa\nNectrotizing otitis externa is a serious, but rare, complication of otitis externa, where\u00a0the infection spreads to the bone that surrounds your ear canal.\nIt\u00a0usually\u00a0affects adults more than children. Adults who have a weakened immune system are at\u00a0a\u00a0particularly\u00a0increased risk of developing it. This includes people:\n\nhaving chemotherapy\nwith certain long-term health conditions, such as diabetes\u00a0or HIV\n\nSigns and symptoms of\u00a0necrotizing otitis externa can include:\n\nsevere ear pain and headaches\nexposed bone visible in your ear canal\nfacial nerve palsy \u2013 where your face droops on the side of the affected ear\n\nWithout treatment,\u00a0necrotizing\u00a0otitis externa can be fatal. However, it can be effectively treated using antibiotics and surgery to remove any damaged tissue.\n\n\nIt's not always possible to prevent otitis externa, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition.\nAvoid damaging your ears\n\nDon't insert cotton wool buds or other objects into your ears. Wax works its way out naturally and cotton buds should only be used to sweep around your outer ear.\nIf earwax build-up\u00a0is a problem, have it removed by a healthcare professional.\n\nKeep your ears dry and clean\n\nTry not to let water, soap or shampoo get inside your ears when you wash them. Wear a shower cap while you shower or bathe if you don't intend to wash your hair.\nAfter washing, dry your ears using a hairdryer on a low setting. Never push the corners of a towel into your ears to dry them, as this can cause damage.\nIf you swim regularly, wear a swimming hat that covers your ears or use ear plugs (but make sure you insert them carefully and don't use them if they irritate your ears).\nDon't swim in polluted water.\nTurn your head from side to side after getting out of water. This helps water drain from your ears.\nDon't stick anything into your ear canal. This includes pens/pencils, fingers, bobby clips or cotton-tipped swabs. Swabs should only be used to dry the outer ear.\n\nTreat and prevent other skin conditions\n\nIf you develop otitis externa and you have allergies, tell your GP or practice nurse. Ear drops that contain certain substances, such as neomycin, are more likely to cause an allergic reaction. Your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist can\u00a0advise you about which ear drops are most suitable for you.\nIf you have an allergic reaction to anything that is placed inside your ears, such as hearing aids, earplugs or earrings, remove the item. A mild allergic reaction will usually clear up on its own. Using hypoallergenic products (products that have a lower potential for causing allergic reactions) may also help.\nSeek medical advice for any other skin conditions, such as psoriasis or eczema, so they can be treated using the right medication.\nTry using acidifying ear drops or spray to help keep your ears clean, particularly before and after swimming. These are available without a prescription in most pharmacies and may help to prevent otitis externa recurring.\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Ovarian cancer is most common in women and anyone with ovaries who has\u00a0been through\u00a0the\u00a0menopause\u00a0(usually over the age of 50). It can affect women and anyone with ovaries of any age.\nAs the\u00a0symptoms of ovarian cancer can be similar to those of other conditions, it can be difficult to recognise. However, there are early symptoms to look out for, such as\u00a0persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, and difficulty eating.\nIt's important to speak to your GP if you experience these symptoms, particularly over a\u00a0long period of time. Read more about how ovarian cancer is diagnosed.\nThe ovaries are a pair of small organs in the female reproductive system that contain and release an egg once a month. This is known as ovulation.\nDifferent types of ovarian cancer affect different parts of the ovaries. Epithelial ovarian cancer, which affects the surface layers of the ovary, is the most common type. This topic focuses\u00a0on epithelial ovarian cancer.\nWhat causes ovarian cancer?\nThe exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain things are thought to increase a woman's risk of developing the condition, such as age, the number of eggs the ovaries release and whether someone in your family has had ovarian or breast cancer in the past.\u00a0However, only 1 in 10 cases of ovarian cancer has a genetic link.\nRead more about the causes of ovarian cancer\nTreating ovarian cancer\u00a0\nThe treatment you receive for ovarian cancer will depend on several things, including the stage of your\u00a0cancer and your general health. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ovarian cancer, but your treatment will usually involve a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.\nRead more about how ovarian cancer is treated\nAs with most types of cancer, the outlook for ovarian cancer will depend on the stage it's at when diagnosed \u2013 that is, how far the cancer has advanced. The Cancer\u00a0Research UK website has more information\u00a0about the outlook for ovarian cancer.\nBeing diagnosed with\u00a0ovarian cancer can affect daily life in many ways. However, support is available for many aspects of\u00a0living with\u00a0ovarian cancer, including emotional, financial and long-term health issues.\nOvarian cancer screening\nThere are methods of screening for ovarian cancer but, currently, they haven't been fully tested. Screening\u00a0is only available for women and anyone with ovaries who are at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene.\u00a0Clinical trials in the UK are currently being carried out to assess the effectiveness of screening in high-risk groups and in the general population. A cervical screening test, which used to be called a smear test, can't detect ovarian cancer.\nRead more about preventing ovarian cancer\n\n\nThe symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, particularly in its early stages.\nThis is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS).\nHowever, 3 main symptoms are more frequent:\n\nincreased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes)\npersistent pelvic and abdominal pain\ndifficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous\n\nOther symptoms, such as back pain,\u00a0needing to pass urine more frequently than usual, and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area. However, they may be\u00a0a sign of ovarian cancer.\nIf you have these types of symptoms, try keeping a diary to record how many of these symptoms you have over a longer period. Bear in mind\u00a0that ovarian cancer is rare in women and anyone with ovaries under 40 years of age.\nSpeak to your GP if you have these symptoms regularly (on most days for 3 weeks or more). Although it's unlikely they're being caused by a serious problem, it's best to check.\nIf you've already seen your GP and the symptoms continue or get worse, you should go back and explain this. You know your body better than anyone.\nRead further information:\n\nTarget Ovarian Cancer:\u00a0ovarian cancer symptoms\n\n\n\nSeveral possible causes of ovarian cancer have been identified, along with risks that may make developing the condition more likely.\nCancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nIn ovarian cancer, cells in the ovary start to change and grow abnormally. If the cancer isn't identified at an early stage, it can spread to the abdomen and pelvis, including other parts of the female reproductive system.\nIncreased risk\nThe exact cause of epithelial ovarian cancer (the main type) isn't known, but certain things may increase your risk of developing it.\nYour risk of ovarian cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring after the menopause. Most cases of ovarian cancer occur in women and anyone with ovaries who are over 50 years of age.\nIf you have 2 or more close relatives (mother, sister or daughter) who developed ovarian cancer or breast cancer, your risk of also developing the condition may be increased.\nIf your relatives developed cancer before the age of 50, it's more likely it was the result of an inherited faulty gene. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are faulty genes that are linked to ovarian cancer. They're also known to increase the risk of breast cancer.\nHaving relatives with ovarian cancer doesn't mean you definitely have a faulty gene in the family \u2013 the cancer could have happened by chance. Only\u00a01 in 10 (10%) of ovarian cancers are thought to be caused by a faulty gene.\nYou may be at high risk of having a faulty gene if you have:\n\n1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 2 close relatives with breast cancer whose average age is under 60; all of these relatives should be on the same side of your family (either your mother's\u00a0or father's side)\n1 relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least 1 close relative diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50; both of these relatives should come from the same side of your family\n2 relatives from the same side of the family diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age\u00a0\n\nIf you're at a higher risk of having a faulty gene, your GP can refer you for tests to check for faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.\nEvery time an egg is released into the reproductive system, the surface of the ovary breaks to let it out. The surface of the ovary is damaged during this process and needs to be repaired. Each time this happens, there's a greater chance of abnormal cell growth during the repair.\u00a0\nThis may be why the risk of ovarian cancer decreases if you take the contraceptive pill, or have multiple pregnancies or periods of breastfeeding. At these times, eggs aren't released.\nThere's no strong evidence to show that those who have infertility treatment have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, it's thought that\u00a0infertility itself may increase ovarian cancer\u00a0risk and research into this area is being carried out.\u00a0\nWomen and anyone with ovaries who take\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been shown to have a small increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, if HRT is stopped, after 5 years the risk is reduced to the same level as those who've never taken HRT.\nEndometriosis may also increase your risk of ovarian cancer. In endometriosis, the cells that usually line the womb grow elsewhere in the body.\nThese endometrial cells behave as if they were in the womb, so thickening and bleeding that usually occurs during menstruation,\u00a0occurs in other parts of the body. There's no way for this endometrial tissue to leave the body so it becomes trapped, leading to pain, swelling and bleeding in that area.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Ovarian cancer risks and causes\n\n\n\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you have any symptoms of ovarian cancer.\nYour GP will gently feel your tummy (abdomen) and ask you about your symptoms, general health and whether there's a history of ovarian or\u00a0breast cancer in your family.\nThey may carry out an internal examination and may take a blood sample or refer you for an\u00a0ultrasound scan.\nIf needed, you may also be referred to a specialist (a gynaecologist or gynaecological oncologist) at a hospital.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected ovarian cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nBlood test (CA125)\nYou may have a blood test to look for a protein called CA125 in your blood. CA125 is produced by some ovarian cancer cells.\u00a0A very high level of CA125 may indicate that you have ovarian cancer.\nHowever, CA125 isn't specific to ovarian cancer and it can be raised in conditions including endometriosis,\u00a0fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease\u00a0and pregnancy, so\u00a0a raised CA125 level doesn't definitely mean you have ovarian cancer.\nThe Lab Tests Online UK website has more information\u00a0on the CA125 test.\nThe\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced\u00a0guidance that recommends testing for CA125 if you frequently experience:\u00a0\n\nbloating\nfeeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite\u00a0\npelvic or abdominal pain\u00a0\nneeding to urinate urgently and/or frequently\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRead the full\u00a0NICE guidance about the recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer (PDF, 179kb).\nIf you experience unexplained weight loss, fatigue or changes in your bowel habits, such as\u00a0diarrhoea or constipation, you may also be tested for CA125.\nIf you're 50 or over and you've experienced symptoms that could suggest\u00a0irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the last 12 months, such as bloating, abdominal pain or changes in your bowel habits, your GP should test your CA125 level.\nAround half\u00a0of all women and anyone with ovaries with early-stage ovarian cancer\u00a0have a raised level of CA125 in their blood. If your CA125 level is raised,\u00a0you'll be referred for an ultrasound scan.\nUltrasound scan\nAn ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your ovaries. You may have an internal ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina, or you may have an external ultrasound, where the probe is put next to your stomach.\nThe image produced can show the size and texture of your ovaries, plus any cysts or other swellings that are present.\nFurther tests\nIf you've been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have further tests to see how large the cancer is and\u00a0if it's spread. This is called staging.\nOther tests you may have include:\n\na chest X-ray\na CT scan\u00a0or MRI scan\nabdominal fluid aspiration \u2013 a thin needle\u00a0is passed into your abdomen, so that a fluid sample can be taken and tested for cancerous cells\u00a0\nlaparoscopy \u2013 a thin tube with a camera on the end\u00a0is\u00a0inserted through a small incision in your lower abdomen, so that your ovaries can be examined; a small tissue sample may also be taken from your ovaries for testing (a biopsy)\n\nStaging helps your doctors to decide on the best kind of treatment for your condition. However, it's important to remember that the stage of your ovarian cancer alone cannot predict how your condition will progress.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information\u00a0on further tests for ovarian cancer.\nStages and grades of ovarian cancer\nIf your test results indicate that you have ovarian cancer,\u00a0it will be given a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. The 4 commonly used stages of ovarian cancer are:\n\nstage 1 \u2013 where the cancer only affects one or both of the ovaries\nstage 2 \u2013 where the cancer has spread from the ovary and into the pelvis or\u00a0womb\nstage 3 \u2013 where the cancer has spread to the lining of the abdomen, the surface of the bowel and the lymph nodes in the pelvis\nstage 4 \u2013 where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the\u00a0liver, spleen or lungs\u00a0\n\nThis is a simplified guide. Each stage is further divided into categories A, B and C.\u00a0Ask your doctor if you're not sure what stage you have.\nThe grade of cancer refers to the appearance of\u00a0cells under a microscope. The grades are as follows:\n\nlow grade \u2013 although abnormal, cells appear to be slow-growing\nmoderate grade \u2013 cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells\nhigh grade \u2013 cells look very abnormal and are likely to be fast-growing\n\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information\u00a0on the stages and grading of ovarian cancer.\n\n\nSurgery\nMost people with ovarian cancer will\u00a0be considered for\u00a0surgery. It sometimes isn't possible to confirm the stage of the cancer until surgery is carried out.\nYour doctor will discuss what will happen during surgery. It will probably involve removing:\n\nboth ovaries and the fallopian tubes (a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy)\nthe womb\u00a0(a total abdominal hysterectomy)\nthe omentum \u2013 a fatty layer of tissue within the abdomen (an omentectomy)\n\nThe surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes from your pelvis and abdomen, and samples of nearby tissue, to find out whether the cancer has spread.\nIf it has spread, the surgeon will try to remove as much of it as possible. This is known as 'debulking surgery'.\nIf the cancer is confined to 1 or both ovaries, you may only need to have the ovary or ovaries removed, leaving your womb intact. This means you may still be able to carry a pregnancy.\nYou will probably be ready to go home 3 to 7 days after your operation, but it can take many weeks to fully recover.\nWhen you go home, you'll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness.\u00a0Walking and swimming are good exercises that are suitable for most people after treatment for ovarian cancer. Discuss the types of exercise that are suitable for you\u00a0with your doctor or physiotherapist.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: surgery for ovarian cancer\nMacmillan: surgery for ovarian cancer\n\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill cancer cells. It's often given after surgery for ovarian cancer. In some cases, it can be given before surgery to help shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. This is called 'neoadjuvant chemotherapy'.\nSeveral different medicines can be used in chemotherapy. A combination is often given. The choice of medicine and how and when it's given depends on the\u00a0stage of your cancer and how much it has spread. The most common treatment for ovarian cancer is a platinum-containing medicine (carboplatin), which is used alone or in combination with another medicine called paclitaxel.\nChemotherapy is usually given as\u00a0a drip\u00a0into the vein, but is sometimes given as tablets. Some studies have looked at giving chemotherapy directly into the abdomen \u2013 called 'intraperitoneal chemotherapy'. It is not currently established routine practice in the UK, but it's being assessed in clinical trials.\nYou'll usually have chemotherapy as an outpatient, but you may sometimes need a short stay in hospital. It's usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment followed by a period of rest, to allow the body to recover. Most women and anyone with ovaries have 6 cycles of chemotherapy.\nIs chemotherapy working?\nOver the course of your chemotherapy, you'll have tests to monitor how the cancer is responding to treatment. This can be done in a number of ways. For example:\n\nif you had higher than normal levels of the\u00a0protein CA125 in your blood when diagnosed, you may have blood tests to see whether the levels are falling\nif you had a tumour visible on a\u00a0CT scan\u00a0or ultrasound scan when\u00a0diagnosed, you may have repeated scans to see whether it has shrunk\nyou may have another small operation, known as 'second-look surgery', which is carried out in the same way as a laparoscopy\n\nAfter your chemotherapy treatment, if all of your tests are clear of cancer, you'll be in remission. This means the cancer is under control.\nSide effects of chemotherapy\nSide effects\u00a0of chemotherapy\u00a0include:\n\ninfections\nloss of appetite\nnausea and vomiting\ntiredness\nhair loss\u00a0\nsore mouth\n\nMany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe.\nChemotherapy for recurring cancer\nOvarian cancer can come back (relapse) after treatment. If this happens, you may have another course of chemotherapy. This is called 'second-line treatment'.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: chemotherapy for ovarian cancer\nMacmillan: chemotherapy for ovarian cancer\nTarget Ovarian Cancer: when cancer comes back\n\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0uses high energy X-rays. Like chemotherapy, it works by targeting rapidly growing cancer cells.\nRadiotherapy isn't usually used to treat ovarian cancer. However, the multidisciplinary team may occasionally recommend\u00a0it to treat\u00a0ovarian cancer under very specific circumstances, such as treating pain and bleeding from a localised tumour mass.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: radiotherapy for ovarian cancer\nMacmillan: radiotherapy for ovarian cancer\n\nClinical trials\nIn recent years,\u00a0much progress has been made in ovarian cancer treatment. More women and anyone with ovaries are living longer and experiencing fewer side effects. These advances were discovered through\u00a0clinical trials,\u00a0where new medicines and combinations of medicines are compared with standard treatment.\nAll cancer trials in the UK are subject to careful monitoring,\u00a0to ensure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials can\u00a0often do better overall than in routine care.\nIf you're asked about taking part in a trial, you'll be offered an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you'll be asked to give your consent (permission)\u00a0by signing a form. You're always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research: ovarian cancer research.\n\nPsychological help\nDealing with cancer can be a huge challenge for patients and their families. It can bring emotional and practical difficulties.\nIt often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways to find help and support. For example:\n\nyour hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor;\u00a0talk to your GP if\u00a0you're feeling depressed;\u00a0a course of\u00a0antidepressants may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist\nit can help to talk to someone who's been through the same thing as you; many organisations have helplines and online forums; they can also put you in touch with other people who have had cancer treatment\n\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan Cancer Support\nTarget Ovarian Cancer: sources of support for women with ovarian cancer\u00a0\n\n\n\nRecovery and follow-up\nMany women and anyone with ovaries with ovarian cancer have a hysterectomy. This is a major operation and takes around 6 to 12 weeks to recover from.\nDuring this time, you'll have to avoid lifting things, such as children and heavy shopping bags, and doing heavy housework. You won't be able to drive for 3 to 8\u00a0weeks after the operation. You'll usually need 4 to 12 weeks off work after a hysterectomy.\nIf your ovaries have been removed and you haven't already been through the menopause, you'll experience the\u00a0menopause after your treatment. You may decide to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to control your symptoms. Your GP will\u00a0help you decide what's best for you.\nSome treatments for ovarian cancer, particularly chemotherapy, can make you feel very tired. You may need a break from your normal activities for a while. Don't be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it.\nPractical help may also\u00a0be available from your local authority. Ask your doctor or nurse who to contact.\nAfter your treatment has finished, you'll be invited for regular check-ups to see how well you are responding to treatments. These are usually every 2 to 3 months to begin with.\nRead further information:\n\nTarget Ovarian Cancer: sources of support for women with ovarian cancer\nMacmillan: follow-up after treatment for ovarian cancer\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSex and relationships\nHaving cancer isn't always easy to talk about, either for you or\u00a0your family and friends. You may sense that some people avoid you or feel awkward around you.\nBeing open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help\u00a0may put them at ease. However, don't feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself.\nRead further information:\n\nTalking to your kids about cancer\nMacmillan:\u00a0talking about cancer\n\nOvarian cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life in several ways.\nIf you haven't already been through the menopause, removing your ovaries means you'll have an early menopause. You're likely to have symptoms of the menopause, which can include vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire.\nIt's common to lose interest in sex after treatment for ovarian cancer. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired, and\u00a0you may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer.\nYou may also feel grief about the loss of your fertility. It's understandable that you may not feel like having sex while coping with all this. Share your feelings with your partner. If your feelings about sex aren't improving with time, you may want to consider speaking to a counsellor or sex therapist.\nMoney and benefits\nIf you have to reduce or stop working due to your cancer, you may find it difficult to cope financially. If you have cancer or you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support. For example:\n\nif you have a job but can't work because of your illness, you're entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) from your employer\u00a0\nif you don't have a job and can't work because of your illness, you may be entitled to employment and support allowance (ESR)\nif you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to carer's allowance\nyou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or have a low household income\n\nIt's a good idea to find out\u00a0as soon as possible\u00a0what help is available to you. You could ask to speak to the social worker at your hospital, who\u00a0can\u00a0give you the information you need.\nRead further information:\n\nMoney Advice Service\u00a0\u00a0\nTarget Ovarian Cancer: financial hardship for women with ovarian cancer\u00a0\n\nDealing with dying\nIf you're told\u00a0that nothing more can be done to treat your ovarian cancer,\u00a0care will focus on controlling your symptoms and helping you feel as comfortable as possible. This is called palliative care. It also includes psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family or carers.\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan: support if you're caring for someone with ovarian cancer\nMarie Curie Cancer Care: support for people dying at home\n\n\n\nThere's currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer. However, there are a number of things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer.\nStopping ovulation and the contraceptive pill\nEach time you ovulate, your ovaries are damaged by the egg as it breaks through the surface of the ovary and is\u00a0released into your reproductive system.\nThe cells that make up the surface of your ovaries divide and multiply rapidly to repair the damage caused by the egg. It's this rapid cell growth that can occasionally go wrong and result in ovarian cancer.\nAnything that stops the process of ovulation can help to minimise your chances of developing ovarian cancer. This includes:\n\npregnancy\u00a0and breastfeeding\nthe contraceptive pill\nhysterectomy surgery (removal of the ovaries)\n\nDiet and lifestyle\nOvarian cancer may be linked to being overweight or obese. Losing weight\u00a0through\u00a0regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet may help lower your risk of getting ovarian cancer. Aside from this, regular exercise and a healthy, low-fat diet are extremely beneficial to your overall health, and can help\u00a0to prevent all forms of cancer\u00a0and heart disease.\nScreening for ovarian cancer\nAt present, there's no screening method\u00a0for ovarian cancer that is reliable enough to be used by all women and anyone with ovaries in the UK.\u00a0Clinical trials into this are continuing.\nYou may be eligible for screening if you're at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history, or if you've\u00a0inherited a\u00a0specific abnormal gene.\nIf you're at high risk, your GP can refer you to your local genetics service or family cancer clinic. You may be screened for ovarian cancer when you're\u00a0over the age of 35, or when you're 5 years away from the age at which your youngest relative was diagnosed with the condition. From this point, you'll be screened again once a year.\nThe screening tests for ovarian cancer are the same as those routinely used to diagnose it. The tests are:\n\na\u00a0blood test for higher-than-normal levels of CA125 (a protein produced by cancer cells)\na transvaginal ultrasound \u2013 where an\u00a0ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina so that the size and texture of your ovaries can be seen, as well as any\u00a0ovarian cysts that may be present\n\nThe tests are used together to produce results that are as accurate as possible. However, as these screening methods are still in the process of being tested, there's no guarantee\u00a0they'll identify every case of ovarian cancer.\nA cervical screening test, previously known as a smear test, can't detect ovarian cancer.\nRead further information:\nCancer Research UK: ovarian cancer screening\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "This section is for teenagers and young adults.

This is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). Your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby.\nYour reproductive system\nYour reproductive system is made up of the:\n\nvagina\u00a0\u2013 the passage from the cervix to outside your body\ncervix\u00a0\u2013 the opening from the womb to the vagina\nwomb (also called uterus)\u00a0\u2013 where a baby grows during pregnancy\nfallopian tubes\u00a0\u2013 which connect your ovaries to the womb\novaries\u00a0\u2013 which store all your eggs and release one every month after puberty\n\nFacts about ovaries\nYou have\u00a02 ovaries\u00a0\u2013 1 on each side of your womb. They\u2019re about 4cm long.\nAt puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. These cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start.\nEvery month after puberty, your ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes to the womb. The womb\u2019s lining gets thicker, ready for an egg to be fertilised by a man\u2019s sperm. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the womb\u2019s lining comes out of your vagina as blood. This is a period.\nWhen a woman is about 50 her periods stop because her ovaries have run out of eggs so they stop making hormones. This is called the menopause.\nTypes of ovarian cancer\u00a0\nThere are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours.\nTeenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. You may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called:\n\ndysgerminoma\nteratoma\nyolk sac tumour\n\nGerm cell tumours of the ovary are rare. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary. Treatment will usually cure germ cell tumours.\nYour specialist will explain more about the type of germ cell tumour that you have. If you have a type of ovarian cancer or germ cell tumour that's not listed here, you can talk to one of\u00a0Macmillan's cancer support specialists to find out more.\n\n\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults.\nGerm cell tumours of the ovary are the most common type of ovarian cancer in teenagers and young women. If you have a different type of ovarian cancer and want to know more you can talk to Macmillan Cancer Support.\nGerm cell tumours are a rare type of ovarian cancer. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary in girls and young women (aged 10 to 30). Tumours are often only in\u00a01 ovary. They can usually be successfully treated, even if they\u2019ve spread to other places in the body.\nGerm cell tumours can also develop in teenage boys\u2019 or men\u2019s testicles, or rarely in other parts of the body. This page is about germ cell tumours that start in the ovary, but we have more information about testicular cancer.\nCauses\nThe cause of germ cell tumours is unknown. Research into possible causes is going on all the time.\nGerm cells are a normal part of the ovary, but something causes them to change. This makes them grow too quickly and make a tumour.\nSigns and symptoms\n\npain or swelling in your tummy (abdomen)\u00a0\na\u00a0feeling of fullness or bloating in your tummy\nneeding to pee more often\nirregular periods\n\nRemember \u2013 these symptoms happen for lots of reasons other than cancer. But if you have any of them it\u2019s important to speak to your GP.\nIf you're worried about ovarian cancer\nIf you think you might have some of these symptoms, go and see your GP. They'll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think they could be because of cancer, they can do some\u00a0tests to find out more.\nWe have more information for young people about:\n\nhaving tests for ovarian cancer\ntreatment of overian cancer\n\nIf you're looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general\u00a0ovarian cancer section.\n\n\nThere are some tests that you might have at your doctor's or at the hospital, to help them see if you have ovarian cancer.\nVisiting your GP\nIf you think you might have any\u00a0symptoms of ovarian cancer, you should speak to your GP. They'll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think these could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more.\nThese might include:\n\na blood test\nan ultrasound of the ovaries\nan internal examination, to check the organs in your pelvis\n\nFor an internal examination, you lie on your back with your feet together and your knees apart. The doctor will gently put\u00a01 or\u00a02 fingers inside your vagina and press a little on your lower tummy. It shouldn\u2019t be painful but it can feel uncomfortable.\nThis test might make you feel embarrassed, but doctors are used to doing this investigation and it\u2019s over quickly. If a male doctor examines you, there will usually be a female nurse present, but if not you can ask for one. You can have someone you feel close to with you during the examination, or if you prefer you can ask whoever is with you to go out until it\u2019s over. You can do whatever makes you feel most comfortable.\nAfter these tests, your GP may arrange for you to see a doctor at the hospital who specialises in problems of the reproductive system (a gynaecologist).\nAt the hospital\nThe specialist will carry out an internal examination to check if there\u2019s anything unusual in the shape and position of your ovaries and womb. Your GP may have already done an internal examination.\u00a0\nThe specialist will arrange for you to have some more tests. Different tests are used to diagnose germ cell tumours of the ovary.\nBlood tests check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers. Some germ cell tumours produce high levels of these.\nUltrasound scans use sound waves to build up a picture of your ovaries and the area around them on a computer screen. The person doing the scan will rub some gel on your tummy and gently move a small device over your tummy to produce the picture. You may also have an ultrasound scan done through the vagina (transvaginal ultrasound), to get a clearer picture. A small probe about the size of a tampon is gently put inside your vagina. It\u2019s not painful but it can be a bit uncomfortable. You can have someone with you during the test if you want to.\nCT scans\u00a0take a series of X-rays, which build up a 3D picture of the area of the body being scanned. It can show up the size and position of a tumour.\nLaparoscopy is a test that\u2019s sometimes done to look inside your tummy at your ovaries. It\u2019s done under a general anaesthetic. You can usually go home the same day. The surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in the skin in your lower tummy (just above the bikini line). Then they put a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end (called a laparoscope) through one of the cuts to look at the ovaries. Sometimes the surgeon will remove the ovary at the same time as the laparoscopy but they will discuss this with you before you have the surgery. The removed\u00a0ovary\u00a0will be looked at under a microscope to find out exactly what type of tumour it is.\u00a0\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends, your specialist nurse or your doctor can help.\nWe've got more information for young people about:\n\ngerm cell tumours of the ovary \u2013\u00a0causes and symptoms\ntreatment of ovarian cancer\u00a0\nliving with and after ovarian cancer\n\nIf you're looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our\u00a0ovarian cancer section.\n\n\nMost girls and young women can be cured of germ cell tumours of the ovary.\nYour treatment will depend on the type of germ cell tumour you have and whether it has spread outside the ovaries. Treatment is usually a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, although you may only need surgery.\nBefore you have treatment, your specialist needs to know the type of germ cell tumour you have and what stage it is. The stage of a cancer describes the size of the tumour and whether it has spread outside the ovary to any other parts of your body.\nYour specialist will tell you the exact stage of the cancer after the operation to remove your ovary. Most germ cell tumours are diagnosed early when they\u2019re in one or sometimes both ovaries but haven\u2019t spread anywhere else in the body. Waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. But this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.\nAnother important part of ovarian cancer treatment is to try to make sure it doesn\u2019t make you infertile (unable to get pregnant). Your doctors will think very carefully about this when planning your treatment.\nSurgery\nYou may have an\u00a0operation to remove the affected ovary and the fallopian tube. If it\u2019s a very early germ cell tumour this might be the only treatment you need. After your operation you\u2019ll come back to the clinic for regular checks. If there are any signs of the cancer coming back, it\u2019s treated straight away.\nHaving the affected ovary and fallopian tube removed won\u2019t stop you from having a baby in the future. You can still get pregnant with only\u00a01 ovary.\nBefore surgery you\u2019ll have a general anaesthetic. During the operation, the surgeon will make a cut in the lower tummy. The ovary is removed through this cut. The operation is called a laparotomy.\nIf the cancer has spread, the surgeon may still do an operation to try to remove as much of the tumour as they can. If possible they will try to leave the other ovary and the womb. You will have more treatment after your operation to treat any of the tumour that they could not remove.\nRemoving both ovaries and the womb is only done if there\u2019s no other way of successfully treating the cancer. Unfortunately this means you will not be able to get pregnant in the future. This can be very upsetting news. You may not have thought about having children yet, so it may be difficult to take in. If this happens there will be lots of support to help you.\nChemotherapy\u00a0\nChemotherapy\u00a0is given after your operation to:\n\nget rid of any cancer cells that weren\u2019t removed with surgery\nstop the cancer from coming back\n\nYour specialist will explain more about this to you. Germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy and this treatment cures most girls. If it\u2019s a very early germ cell tumour you might not even need chemotherapy.\nGerm cell tumours are often treated with the drugs bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin. When these are given together it\u2019s called BEP for short.\nChemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment that usually take 3 weeks. You\u2019ll have 3 to 4 cycles. You\u2019ll spend the first 3 to 5 days of each cycle having your chemotherapy. You\u2019ll usually stay in hospital for those days. You\u2019ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and then again the following week.\nDifferent chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. Some girls just have a few side effects, and others have more.\nMost side effects are temporary and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common side effects are:\n\nhair loss\ntiredness\nfeeling sick or being sick (this can often be controlled with medicine)\nbeing more at risk of getting an infection\n\nDoctors can\u2019t be certain whether you\u2019ll be able to get pregnant (fertility) in the future after you\u2019ve had chemotherapy. They may talk to you about storing your eggs before chemotherapy starts. Stored eggs can be used with fertility treatments when you\u2019re ready to try to get pregnant.

You might have more surgery after you\u2019ve finished chemotherapy if there\u2019s still some tumour left behind.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Some types of germ cell tumour are sensitive to radiotherapy, but it is rarely used.\nWe\u00a0have\u00a0more information about:\n\ngerm cell tumours of the ovary \u2013 causes and symptoms\nhaving tests for ovarian cancer\n\nIf you're looking for information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, read our general\u00a0ovarian cancer information.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body.\nExcess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body\u2019s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as:\n\nnervousness and anxiety\nhyperactivity \u2013 where a person can\u2019t stay still and is full of nervous energy\nunexplained or unplanned weight loss\u00a0\nswelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goitre, to form in the throat\n\nThe severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person.\nRead more about the symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland\nWhat causes an overactive thyroid gland?\nThe thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine.\nThey affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going.\nIn hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body's metabolism.\nThere are several possible underlying causes, the most common being Graves' disease, in which the body's immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones.\nRead more about the causes of an overactive thyroid gland\nTreatment\nAn overactive thyroid\u00a0usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms.\nThe three most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are:\n\nthionamides \u2013 a group of medications, including\u00a0carbimazole and methimazole,\u00a0that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone\nradioiodine treatment \u2013\u00a0a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland, reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health)\nsurgery \u2013\u00a0in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the\u00a0thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitre\n\nBeta-blockers may also\u00a0sometimes be used\u00a0to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland, although it doesn't target the thyroid gland itself.\nIt's common for treatment to lead to the thyroid not producing enough hormones. This is known as having an\u00a0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\u00a0However, an\u00a0underactive thyroid is not\u00a0usually serious and\u00a0is easily treated.\nRead more about the treatment of an overactive thyroid gland\nComplications\nAround 1 in 20 people with Graves' disease will also develop symptoms affecting their eyes, such as:\n\ndouble vision\nsensitivity to light (photophobia)\ntearing (excess production of tears)\n\nThis is known as Graves' ophthalmopathy and should be seen by a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (an ophthalmologist).\nA rarer and more serious complication is a\u00a0sudden and severe flare-up of symptoms, known as a thyroid storm. A thyroid storm\u00a0can be\u00a0life-threatening, as it causes severe\u00a0dehydration\u00a0and heart problems.\nRead more about the complications of an overactive thyroid gland\nWho is affected\nWomen are 10 times more likely to have an overactive thyroid gland than men.\nIt is estimated that around 1 in 50 women in England currently live with an overactive thyroid gland.\nIn most cases, symptoms will begin somewhere between the ages of 20 and 40, though they can start at any age, including in childhood.\nAn overactive thyroid gland occurs most frequently in white and Asian people, and less frequently in\u00a0African-Caribbean\u00a0people.\n\n\nAn overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) has many signs and symptoms, although it is unlikely you would develop all of them.\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism\nIf you have hyperthyroidism, you may experience some of the following symptoms:\n\nhyperactivity\nmood swings \u2013 such as anxiety, irritability and nervousness\ndifficulty sleeping (insomnia)\nfeeling tired all the time (fatigue)\nmuscle weakness\nneeding to pass stools (faeces) or urine more\u00a0frequently\nexcess fats in your stools \u2013 which can make them greasy and difficult to flush down the toilet (steatorrhoea)\nsensitivity to heat and\u00a0excess sweating\nunexplained or unexpected weight loss \u2013 despite having an increased appetite (though in a small number of cases, the increase in appetite can lead to weight gain)\nvery infrequent or light periods, or periods stopping altogether\ninfertility\nloss of interest in sex\u00a0\n\nIf you have diabetes, your diabetic symptoms, such as extreme thirst and tiredness, may be made worse by hyperthyroidism.\nSigns of hyperthyroidism\nIf you have hyperthyroidism, you may have some of the following physical signs:\n\na swelling in your neck caused by an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)\nirregular and/or\u00a0unusually fast heart rate (palpitations)\ntrembling or shaking (tremor)\nwarm, moist skin\nredness on the palms of your hands\nloosening of your nails in their nail beds\nhives (urticaria)\npatchy hair loss (alopecia)\ntwitching in your face and limbs\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee your GP if you are experiencing any of the above. They may not be the result of an overactive thyroid gland, but they will need further investigation.\nIt might be useful to make a list of your symptoms, as this can often be helpful in determining the correct diagnosis.\n\n\nOveractive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones thyroxine or triiodothyronine.\nOverproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions, which are outlined below.\nGraves' disease\nGraves' disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. It can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20-40 years old. You are more likely to develop Graves' disease if you smoke.\nGraves' disease is an autoimmune condition.\u00a0This means the immune system mistakes\u00a0something\u00a0in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it.\nIn\u00a0Graves' disease,\u00a0it attacks the\u00a0thyroid gland, which\u00a0leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones.\nIt is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. Like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved.\nIf you have Graves' disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. This is known as Graves' ophthalmopathy. You may find\u00a0your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent.\nFor more information on Graves' ophthalmopathy, read our page on\u00a0complications of an overactive thyroid gland.\nThyroid nodules\nIt is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. These are known as nodules. It is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign).\nHowever, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. Nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic.\nToxic thyroid nodules account for about\u00a01 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism.\nIodine supplements\nIodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine.\nThis is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism \u2013 sometimes referred to as Jod-Basedow phenomenon. It usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland.\nAmiodarone\nAmiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation). If you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine.\u00a0\nAmiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. This type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.\nFollicular thyroid cancer\nIn rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result of\u00a0thyroid cancer that starts in your thyroid follicles. This can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is also known as functioning thyroid cancer.\n\n\nSee your GP if you think you may have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).\nA diagnosis will be based on your symptoms and the results of\u00a0blood tests that assess how well your thyroid gland is working. These are known as thyroid function tests.\nThyroid function tests\nYour GP will take a sample of your blood and test it for levels of:\n\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\nthyroxine and triiodothyronine (the thyroid hormones)\n\nTSH is made in the pituitary gland in your brain and controls the production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine.\n\nWhen the level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in your blood are normal, your pituitary gland releases a normal level of TSH. When thyroid hormone production becomes excessive, the pituitary gland stops releasing TSH.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen the level of thyroxine or triiodothyronine drops, the pituitary gland produces more TSH to boost it.\n\nIf you have an overactive thyroid, the thyroid function test will show that levels of TSH in your blood are consistently lower than normal. Low levels of TSH mean your thyroid gland is overactive and\u00a0likely to be making\u00a0excessive thyroid hormones. This is the first part of the thyroid function test.\nYour GP will then test your blood for levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. If you have an overactive thyroid, you will have higher than normal levels of both these hormones.\nIn some cases, tests may show you have\u00a0normal thyroid hormone levels, but low or suppressed levels of TSH.\nThis is known a subclinical overactive thyroid gland. If you are diagnosed with subclinical overactive thyroid, you may not need treatment.\nIn most cases, the reduced level of TSH in your blood returns to normal within a couple of months and your subclinical hyperthyroidism will resolve by itself.\nHowever, you will need a further thyroid function test so your condition can be monitored.\nDetermining the underlying cause\nIf tests confirm an overactive thyroid gland, you may be referred for further tests to determine the underlying cause.\nAn additional test that may be used is an isotope thyroid scan. This involves swallowing small amounts of a radioactive substance (an isotope), usually technetium, in capsule or liquid form.\nA scan is then used to measure how much of the isotope has been absorbed by your thyroid gland.\nIf your thyroid gland absorbs a high amount of the isotope, it is likely\u00a0the underlying cause is either Graves' disease or thyroid nodules.\nIf the amount is low, the underlying cause could be due to:\n\nswelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), often caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking thyroid tissue or, less commonly, by infection\nhaving too much iodine in your diet\nin rare cases,\u00a0thyroid cancer\n\n\n\nIf you are diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), your GP will refer you to a specialist in hormonal conditions (endocrinologist) to plan your treatment.\nThe most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid are outlined below.\nThionamides\nThionamides, such as carbimazole and propylthiouracil, are a common treatment. They are a type of medication that stops your thyroid gland producing excess amounts of thyroxine or triiodothyronine.\nAs thionamides affect the production of thyroid hormone rather than their current levels, you will need to take them for several weeks before you notice an improvement (usually between four to eight weeks).\nOnce the production of thyroid hormones is under control, your specialist may gradually reduce your medication.\nYou may need to continue taking thionamides for a long time, until the condition is under control.\nAround 1 in 20 people will experience side effects when they first start taking thionamides, such as:\n\nitchy skin rash\njoint pain\n\nThese side effects should pass once your body is used to the effects of the medication.\nIn rare cases (around 1 in 500), thionamides cause a sudden drop in white blood cells (agranulocytosis), which can make you extremely vulnerable to infection.\u00a0\nSymptoms of agranulocytosis include:\n\nfever\ngum pain, swelling and bleeding\u00a0\nsore throat\u00a0\nmouth ulcers\u00a0\npersistent\u00a0cough\nshortness of breath\n\nIf you are taking thionamides and you experience any of the symptoms above, call your GP immediately for advice and an urgent blood test. If this is not possible, call NHS 111\u00a0service or your local out-of-hours service.\nBeta-blockers\nBeta-blockers,\u00a0such as propranolol or atenolol, can relieve some of the symptoms of an overactive thyroid, including tremor (shaking and trembling), rapid heartbeat and hyperactivity.\nYour specialist may prescribe you a beta-blocker while the condition is being diagnosed, or until\u00a0thionamide brings your thyroid gland under control. However, beta-blockers are not suitable if you have asthma.\nBeta-blockers can sometimes cause side effects, including:\n\nfeeling sick\nfeeling tired all the time (fatigue)\ncold hands and feet\ntrouble sleeping, sometimes with nightmares\n\nRadioiodine treatment\nRadioiodine treatment is a form of radiotherapy used to treat most types of overactive thyroid. Radioactive iodine shrinks your thyroid gland, reducing the amount of thyroid hormone it can produce.\nRadioiodine treatment\u00a0is\u00a0given either as a drink or a capsule to swallow. The dose of radioactivity in the radioiodine is very low and is not harmful.\nRadioiodine treatment is not suitable if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, and may not be suitable if you have eye problems, such as double vision or prominent (bulging) eyes.\nWomen should avoid getting pregnant for at least six months after having radioiodine treatment. Men should not father a child for at least four months after having radioiodine treatment.\nMost people only require a single dose of radioiodine treatment. If a further follow-up dose is required, it is usually given 6 to 12 months after the first dosage.\nA short course of thionamides treatment may be given a few weeks before radioiodine treatment, as this can lead to a more rapid relief of symptoms.\nThionamides or radioiodine?\nIn some cases, a particular treatment may be recommended based on factors such as your age, symptoms and the amount of extra thyroid hormone in your blood. However, there may be circumstances when you are offered a choice between a long-term course of thionamides or radioiodine treatment.\nBoth treatments have advantages and disadvantages.\nAdvantages of thionamides include:\n\nThey are straightforward to take and you do not have to go to hospital to take them.\nThere is less risk of getting an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) as a result of treatment.\n\nDisadvantages of thionamides include:\n\nTreatment\u00a0may not be as successful as radioiodine treatment.\nThere is a higher risk of side effects.\n\nAdvantages of radioiodine treatment include:\n\nTreatment is usually very successful.\n\nDisadvantages of radioiodine treatment include:\n\nThere is\u00a0a higher chance of your thyroid gland becoming underactive as a result of treatment. \u00a0\nRadioiodine treatment is usually not suitable for people with additional symptoms affecting their eyes (Graves' ophthalmopathy).\nWomen have to avoid getting pregnant for at least six months, and men should not father a child for at least four months after treatment.\n\nYou should discuss the potential risks and benefits of both types of treatment with the specialist in charge of your care.\nSurgery\nSurgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland is known as a total or partial thyroidectomy. It is a permanent cure for recurrent overactive thyroid.\nYour specialist may recommend surgery if your thyroid gland is severely swollen (a large goitre) and is causing problems in your neck.\nOther reasons for surgery include:\n\nA person cannot be treated with radioiodine treatment as they are pregnant and are unable or unwilling to take\u00a0thionamides. \u00a0\nA person has a severe form of Graves' ophthalmopathy.\nThe symptoms return (relapse) after a previous successful course of treatment with thionamides.\n\nIt is normally recommended that the entire thyroid gland is removed, as this means\u00a0there will be no chance of a relapse.\nHowever, you will need to take medication for the rest of your life to compensate for the lack of a functioning thyroid gland \u2013 these will be the same medications used to treat an underactive thyroid gland.\n\n\nSeveral complications can occur with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), particularly if the condition is not treated.\nGraves' ophthalmopathy\nIf you have Graves' disease, you may have problems with your eyes. This is known as Graves' ophthalmopathy\u00a0and is thought to be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the tissues of the eyes. It\u00a0affects around\u00a01 in 20 people with Graves\u2019 disease.\nSymptoms of Graves' ophthalmopathy include:\n\neyes feeling dry and gritty\nsensitivity to light (photophobia)\nexcessive tearing\ndouble vision\nsome loss of vision\na feeling of pressure behind the eyes\n\nIn more severe cases, your eyes can bulge prominently from your eye sockets.\nIf you do develop Graves' ophthalmopathy, you will probably be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for treatment.\nTreatment options include:\n\neyedrops to ease the symptoms\nsunglasses to protect the eyes against bright lights\ncorticosteroids\u00a0to reduce inflammation\nradiotherapy\nsurgery\n\nPregnancy and overactive thyroid\nSome women are pregnant when they are first diagnosed with an overactive thyroid gland. Becoming pregnant can lead to a relapse of symptoms, especially in someone with a history of Graves\u2019 disease.\nPregnant women with an overactive thyroid are\u00a0at an increased\u00a0risk of developing complications during pregnancy and birth, such as\u00a0miscarriage and\u00a0eclampsia.\nThey are also more at risk of going into labour prematurely and having a baby with a low birthweight.\nPregnant women will need specialist treatment, so the condition should be managed using medications\u00a0that don't affect the baby. This is likely to be a medication called propylthiouracil.\nUnderactive thyroid\nIn many cases, treatment causes the thyroid gland to release\u00a0levels of hormones that are too low. This is known as having an\u00a0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).\nSometimes this will only be a temporary side effect of treatment, but it can often be permanent.\nSymptoms of an underactive thyroid gland include:\n\nbeing sensitive to cold\nweight gain\nconstipation\u00a0\ndepression\u00a0\ntiredness\n\nAn underactive thyroid gland is treated using medications to help replicate the effects of the thyroid hormones.\nRead more about the treating an underactive thyroid gland\nThyroid storm\nAn undiagnosed or poorly controlled overactive thyroid can lead to a rare but serious reaction called a thyroid storm. It\u00a0affects around 1 in 100 people with an overactive thyroid gland.\nA thyroid storm is a severe and sudden flare-up of symptoms caused by the metabolism going into overdrive, often due to triggers such as:\n\ninfection\npregnancy\nnot taking your medication as directed\ndamage to the thyroid gland, such as a punch to the throat\n\nSymptoms of a thyroid storm include:\n\na very rapid heartbeat (over 140 beats a minute)\nfever (a temperature higher than 38C/100.4F)\ndehydration, with\u00a0diarrhoea and\u00a0vomiting\njaundice \u2013 a yellow tinge to your skin and eyes\nsevere agitation and confusion\nhallucinations\u00a0\u2013 seeing or hearing things that are not real\npsychosis\u00a0\u2013 being unable to tell the difference between reality and your imagination\nexcessive sweating\nchest pain\nmuscle weakness\n\nA thyroid storm is a medical emergency. If you think you or someone in your care is experiencing this complication, you need to call 999 for an ambulance.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple, also known as Paget\u2019s disease of the breast, is a rare type of breast cancer.\nThe term Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from\u00a0Paget\u2019s disease of the bone, which\u00a0occurs when the normal cycle of bone growth is disrupted, leading to the bones becoming weak and deformed.\nA similar type of\u00a0skin cancer can also occur in other parts of the body.\nThe rest of this section will use the term Paget\u2019s disease to refer to Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple or breast.\nSymptoms of Paget's disease\nPaget's disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and\u00a0produces eczema-like symptoms, appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola).\nIt can also appear as a small ulcer or dry, red, flaky patches of skin similar to psoriasis.\nOther possible symptoms include:\n\nitchiness or a burning sensation \u2013 alongside visible changes to the nipple\nbleeding from the skin of the nipple\n\nIf you're experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and isn't red, dry or scaly \u2013 this is extremely unlikely to be Paget's disease but should still be checked by a doctor.\nCauses of Paget's disease\nPaget\u2019s disease is usually a sign of\u00a0breast cancer in tissue behind the nipple, or breast tissue away from the nipple.\nThe breast cancer can either be:\n\ninvasive \u2013\u00a0where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue\nnon-invasive\u00a0\u2013 where the cancerous cells are contained in one or more areas of the breast and are unable to spread\n\nIn a small amount of cases, the only evidence of Paget's disease is the nipple changes.\nIn about half of all cases of Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple, a lump is found in the breast. The majority of people with a lump will have invasive breast cancer, although this does not necessarily mean it has spread.\nMost people with Paget's disease of the nipple who don't have a lump will have non-invasive breast cancer.\nDiagnosing Paget's disease\nYou should visit your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple).\nAs Paget\u2019s disease is a form of breast cancer, the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.\nSpeak to your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. While most\u00a0breast lumps are not cancerous, it's important\u00a0you have it checked out.\nRead more about:\n\nthe symptoms of breast cancer\nhow Paget's disease is diagnosed\n\nTreating Paget's disease\nPaget\u2019s disease is treated in the same way as breast cancer.\u00a0\nSurgery is\u00a0usually the first line of treatment but unlike other forms of breast cancer, it involves removing breast tissue that includes the nipple and areola.\nThis may be followed by a combination of:\n\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 where powerful medication is used to destroy cancerous cells\nradiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells\nbiological or hormone therapy \u2013 which can be used to treat certain types of cancer\u00a0\n\nIf Paget's disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there's a good chance of recovery. Read more about how Paget's disease is treated.\nPreventing Paget's disease\nModifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing alcohol intake and regular exercise, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, these factors remain controversial.\nScreening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. The NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are 47 years of age or over.\nRead more about preventing breast cancer.\nRisk factors for breast cancer\nThere are a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing breast cancer. These include:\n\nage \u2013 your risk of developing breast cancer increases as you get older\nfamily history \u2013 if you have a number of close relatives with breast cancer, your chances of also developing the condition are increased\npreviously being diagnosed with breast cancer\npreviously having a benign breast lump \u2013 certain types of benign lump may slightly increase your risk but this is only seen in a small number of women\nbeing overweight \u2013 which is especially significant in post-menopausal women\nalcohol \u2013 your risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink\n\nIf you have Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.\nFind out more about the register.\n\n\nAs Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple is usually a sign of breast cancer, it's very important you speak to your GP if you notice changes to the tissue or skin of your breast.\nIn particular, you should tell your GP if you notice any changes to:\n\nthe skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the\u00a0nipple)\nyour breasts, particularly\u00a0lumps in your breast\u00a0\n\nPaget\u2019s disease of the nipple can sometimes be confused with\u00a0eczema, a skin condition that also\u00a0causes red, itchy and dry skin.\nTherefore, you should visit your GP for a diagnosis rather\u00a0than assuming you have eczema. Paget\u2019s disease is a form\u00a0of\u00a0breast cancer and\u00a0the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.\nYour GP will examine both breasts, even if you only have a problem with\u00a0one of them. They may also ask you:\n\nabout your symptoms and how long you have had them\nwhether you have a history of eczema, or have eczema anywhere else on your body\nwhether you have a personal or family history of breast cancer\nyour age and whether you have experienced the menopause (when a woman's monthly periods stop)\nwhether you're taking any medication, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is used to treat some of the symptoms of the menopause, or the oral contraceptive pill\nhow much\u00a0alcohol you drink\nhow much you weigh and if you have recently gained weight\n\nIf your GP thinks you may have breast cancer, they will refer you to a specialist breast clinic for tests.\u00a0\nBreast clinic\nWhen you visit a breast clinic you will have tests to find out whether you have breast cancer and, if you have,\u00a0what type of breast cancer.\nStaff at the clinic may take photographs of your breasts to record their current appearance and to help identify any further changes that may occur.\nTests carried out at the clinic may include the following:\n\nan examination of your breast to check for lumps or other abnormalities\na\u00a0mammogram (if you are\u00a035 years of age or over)\nan\u00a0ultrasound scan \u2013 which is the first line of investigation used in younger women\na skin biopsy will be carried out if Paget\u2019s disease is suspected\n\nA mammogram is a simple procedure that uses X-rays to create an image of the inside of your breasts. It can identify early changes in your breast tissue when it may be difficult to feel a lump.\nYounger women often\u00a0have denser breasts than older women, which can make identifying changes more difficult. Therefore, mammograms are not as effective in women under 35 years of age. If you're under 35, your doctor may suggest you have a breast ultrasound instead.\nHowever after a diagnosis of Paget\u2019s disease has been confirmed, mammography will become an important part of pre-surgery assessment.\nDuring\u00a0a mammogram, the radiographer will position 1 of your breasts on a flat X-ray plate. A second X-ray plate will press down on your breast from above, so that it is temporarily compressed and flattened between the 2 plates.\nAn X-ray will be taken, which will give a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast.\nHaving a mammogram can be slightly uncomfortable or even painful, but the procedure will only take a few minutes. Your doctor will examine the image produced by a mammogram for indications of cancer.\nIf you are under\u00a035 years of age, a breast ultrasound may be recommended. This is because your breast tissue may be too dense for a mammogram. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to find out whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.\nUltrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image on a screen. The image will show any lumps or abnormalities\u00a0present in your breasts.\nA\u00a0skin biopsy is used to diagnose Paget\u2019s disease. A biopsy is where a small sample of tissue is taken for examination under a microscope and tests to see if it is cancerous.\nFurther tests\nThere are a number of other tests that can be used if a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed and help determine what types of treatment might be used.\n\n\nPaget\u2019s disease of the nipple is often associated with other forms of breast cancer.\nIt's usually\u00a0treated in the same way as more common types of breast cancer, either by removing the cancerous section of the breast or sometimes by removing the entire breast \u2013 a procedure known as a mastectomy.\nYou can discuss any concerns you have with your oncologist (cancer specialist) who will be able to explain each phase of your treatment.\nSurgery\nIf you're diagnosed with Paget\u2019s disease, surgery is often the first form of treatment you will receive. There are 2 main types of surgery. They are:\n\nmastectomy \u2013 surgery to remove the whole breast, which can be followed by reconstructive surgery to recreate the removed breast\nbreast-conserving surgery \u2013 surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour) in your breast\n\nThese types of surgery will also involve removing your nipple and the darker area of skin surrounding it (the areola).\nA mastectomy removes all your breast tissue, including your nipple. You may need to have a mastectomy if:\n\nthe tumour is large or in the centre of\u00a0your breast\nthere is more than one area of breast cancer\nbreast-conserving surgery (see below) is not able to provide acceptable results\n\nIf lymph nodes (small glands) are removed from your armpit during a mastectomy, the scarring may block the filtering action of the lymph nodes, resulting in a condition called lymphoedema. This is a long-term condition, but can be treated with:\n\nmassage\ncompression sleeves \u2013 tightly fitting bandages that push excess fluid out of your arm\n\nLymphoedema can develop months or sometimes years after surgery. See your breast care nurse or GP if you notice any swelling in your arm or hand on the side of your operation.\nBreast-conserving surgery aims to save as much of your breast as possible while removing the cancer with a rim of healthy tissue.\nIf you have Paget\u2019s disease, your nipple and areola will be removed. You should be offered reconstructive surgery to improve the appearance of your breast after surgery.\nIf you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue removed will depend on:\n\nthe size of the tumour in relation to the size of your breast\nwhether the tumour is in one place or scattered throughout your breast\n\nYour surgeon will remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer so it can be tested for traces of cancer.\nIf cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, you may need to have more tissue surgically removed from your breast.\nAfter having breast-conserving surgery, it's likely you will need radiation treatment (radiotherapy) to destroy any remaining cancer cells.\nBreast reconstruction\nIf you have a mastectomy, you may be able to have reconstructive surgery to recreate your breast. This can be done by:\n\ninserting a breast implant\nusing tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast\n\nThe reconstruction can be carried out at the time of your mastectomy or at a later stage. You should discuss your options fully with your surgeon and breast nurse before making a decision.\nFor example, it may be possible to have reconstructive surgery after breast-conserving surgery to improve the appearance of your breast and create a nipple.\nA nipple can be created by:\n\nhaving a nipple tattooed onto the skin\nusing your own body tissue, such as tissue from your other nipple, although around half of these flatten out and shrink over time\nusing a stick-on latex (rubber) nipple, which can be made from a mould of your other nipple so that\u00a0they are identical; you stick it on every day with glue and it can be removed for washing\n\nProstheses\nIf you decide not to have breast reconstruction, you can wear a false breast or breast prosthesis, which are available free on the NHS.\nAfter having a mastectomy, you may have a temporary, fibre-filled prosthesis and a permanent prosthesis made from silicone, which can be replaced every 2 years.\nFurther treatment\nAfter your surgery, you may need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer, where the cancerous cells have spread into other tissue in your breast.\nIf you had non-invasive breast cancer, where the breast cancer cells were contained in one area of your breast, surgery may be all the treatment you need.\nOther types of treatment for breast cancer include:\n\nchemotherapy \u2013 cytotoxic medication that prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing is used to destroy cancer cells\nradiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 where controlled doses of high-energy radiation, usually X-rays, are used to destroy cancer cells\nbiological therapy \u2013 if your breast cancer is HER2 positive, biological therapy, usually a medication called trastuzumab, can be used to treat the cancer by stopping the effects of HER2 and helping your immune system fight off cancer cells\nhormone therapy \u2013 if your breast cancer is hormone-receptor positive, hormone therapy can be used to treat the cancer by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or stopping their effects\n\n\n\nA number of factors can help reduce your risk of developing breast cancer, including Paget's disease of the nipple.\nDiet and lifestyle\nExercising regularly\u00a0and eating a\u00a0healthy, balanced\u00a0diet are known\u00a0to help prevent\u00a0many forms of cancer, as well as other serious\u00a0health conditions, such as\u00a0heart disease and diabetes.\nStudies have looked at the link between\u00a0breast cancer\u00a0and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions at the moment, there are benefits for women who maintain a\u00a0healthy weight, do regular exercise and who have a low intake of\u00a0saturated fat and alcohol.\nIt has been suggested that exercising regularly (a minimum of 150 minutes or 2 hours 30 minutes a week)\u00a0can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by\u00a0up to\u00a0a third.\nIf you have been through the\u00a0menopause (when your monthly periods stop), it's particularly important you are not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.\nBreastfeeding\nStudies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don't.\nThe reasons are not fully understood, but it could be because women don't ovulate as regularly while they are breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.\nMedication\nIn June 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that two medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\nEither tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who have been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven't.\nThese medications may not be suitable if in the past you have had blood clots\u00a0or womb cancer, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future. Women who have already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts won't be offered these medications because their risk of developing breast cancer is so small.\nA course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.\nRaloxifene can cause side effects including flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your periods and nausea and vomiting.\nYour chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increases while you're taking tamoxifen, so you'll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before any planned surgery.\nCurrently, these 2 medications are not licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased risk of developing the condition. However, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.\nBreast screening\nBreast screening can pick up breast cancer before it forms a lump. The procedure uses mammograms, where X-rays\u00a0are taken,\u00a0to create an image of the inside of your breasts.\nThe\u00a0NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women in the UK who are 50 years of age or over. The NHS has recently extended the breast screening age range so that all women who are 47\u00a0to 73 years of age will be eligible for breast screening.\nNHS breast screening is not usually available for women under 47 years of age. This is because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue which makes mammograms less effective at identifying abnormalities.\nSpeak to your GP if you are below screening age, worried about changes in your breasts, or\u00a0have a family history of breast cancer.\nRead more information about breast cancer screening.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas \u2013 a large gland that's part of the digestive system.\nAround half of all new cases are diagnosed in people aged 75 or over. It's uncommon\u00a0in people under 40 years of age.\nSymptoms of pancreatic cancer\nIn the early stages, a tumour in the pancreas doesn't usually cause any symptoms, which\u00a0can make it difficult to diagnose.\nIt's important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren't usually the result of cancer.\u00a0But you should contact your GP if you're concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly.\nThe first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often:\n\npain in the back or stomach area\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you've eaten\nunexpected weight loss\njaundice\u00a0\u2013 the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes;\u00a0it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured\n\nOther possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:\n\nnausea and vomiting\nbowel changes\nfever and shivering\nindigestion\nblood clots\n\nYou may also develop symptoms of diabetes\u00a0if you have\u00a0pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.\nThere are also a\u00a0number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.\nCancer Research UK has more information on symptoms of endocrine pancreatic tumours.\nCauses of pancreatic cancer\nIt's not fully understood what causes pancreatic cancer, but a number of risk factors for developing the condition have been identified.\nRisk factors for pancreatic cancer include:\n\nage\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it mainly affects people who are 50 to 80 years of age\u00a0\nsmoking\u00a0\u2013 around 1 in 3 cases\u00a0is associated with using cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco\nhaving a history of certain health conditions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as diabetes, chronic pancreatitis (long-term inflammation of the pancreas), stomach ulcer and Helicobacter pylori infection (a stomach infection)\n\nIn about 1 in 10 cases, pancreatic cancer is inherited from a person's parents. Certain genes also increase your chances of getting pancreatitis, which in turn increases your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.\nCancer Research UK\u00a0has more information on risk factors and causes on their website\nDiagnosing pancreatic cancer\nYour GP will first ask about your general health and carry out a physical examination. They\u00a0may examine your tummy (abdomen) for a lump and to see whether your liver is enlarged.\nThey'll also check your skin and eyes\u00a0for signs of\u00a0jaundice and\u00a0may request a urine sample and blood test.\nIf your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you'll usually be referred to a specialist at a hospital for further investigation. You may have either:\n\nan ultrasound scan\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\na\u00a0positron emission tomography (PET) scan\u00a0\u2013 where you're given an injection of a very small amount of radioactive medication, known as a tracer, which helps to show up cancers in an image\n\nDepending on the results of a scan, further tests may include:\n\nan\u00a0endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS)\u00a0endoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a type of endoscopy\u00a0which allows\u00a0close-up ultrasound pictures to be taken of your pancreas\u00a0\nan endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\u00a0\u2013 a type of endoscopy\u00a0which is used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts; the dye will show up on an\u00a0X-ray and highlight any tumours\na\u00a0laparoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to see inside your body using a laparoscopy\u00a0(a thin,\u00a0flexible microscope)\n\nA\u00a0biopsy, where a small sample is taken from a suspected tumour, may also be carried out during these procedures.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\nTo find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nTreating pancreatic cancer\nCancer of the pancreas is difficult to treat. It\u00a0rarely causes any symptoms in the early stages, so it's often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. If the tumour is\u00a0large, treating the cancer will be more difficult.\nIf you've been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your treatment\u00a0will depend on the type and location of your cancer, and how far it's advanced. Your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration.\nThe first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells. If this isn't possible, treatment will focus on preventing the\u00a0tumour growing and causing further harm to your body.\nThe 3 main treatments for pancreatic cancer are:\n\nsurgery\nchemotherapy\nradiotherapy\n\nSome types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require\u00a02\u00a0types of treatment or a combination of all 3.\nRead more about\u00a0treating pancreatic cancer.\nRecovering from surgery\nRecovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.\nYou'll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.\nAfter any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won't be able to eat or drink straight away.\nYou'll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may\u00a0be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.\nAfter the tumour has been removed, you'll probably have a six-month course of chemotherapy, which greatly increases your chance of being cured.\u00a0But because\u00a0cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don't recover\u00a0completely.\nTreatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth.\n\n\nTreatment for pancreatic cancer depends on the type, location and stage of your cancer (how far it's spread).\nYour age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration when deciding on your treatment plan.\nThe first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.\nIf this isn't possible, the focus will be on preventing the tumour growing and causing further harm.\nSometimes it's not\u00a0possible to get rid of the cancer or slow it down,\u00a0so treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.\nCancer of the pancreas is very difficult to treat. In its early stages, this type of cancer rarely causes symptoms, so it's often not detected until it's quite advanced. If the tumour is large or has spread, treating or curing the cancer is much harder.\nCancer Research UK has more information about stages of pancreatic cancer\nDiscussing your treatment\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be a difficult process. There's a lot to take in, so it's important to talk about the possible alternatives with a family member or friend.\nYou should also have an in-depth\u00a0discussion with your doctor, who can tell you the pros and\u00a0cons of the treatments available to you.\nIf at any stage you don't understand the treatment options being explained to you, make sure you ask your doctor for more details.\nThere are 3 main ways that cancer of the pancreas can be treated:\n\nsurgery\nchemotherapy\nradiotherapy\n\nSome types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require 2 or a combination of all 3.\nCancer Research UK\u00a0has more information about types of treatment for pancreatic cancer.\nSurgery is usually the only way\u00a0pancreatic cancer can be completely cured. However, as the condition is usually advanced by the time it's diagnosed, surgery is only suitable for around 15 to 20% of people.\nHowever, this isn't a suitable option\u00a0if your tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels. If your cancer has spread to other areas of the body, surgically removing the tumour won't cure you.\nSurgery for pancreatic cancer is usually only an option for people who have a good general level of\u00a0health. This is because pancreas surgery is often long and complex, and the recovery process can be slow.\nSometimes\u00a0the risks of surgery\u00a0can outweigh the potential benefits.\nYour doctor will discuss with you whether surgery is a suitable option.\nThe Whipple procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer, and involves removing the head of the pancreas.\nYour surgeon must also remove the first part of your small intestine (bowel), your gall bladder (which stores\u00a0bile)\u00a0and part of your bile duct. Sometimes, part of the stomach also has to be removed.\nThe end of the bile duct and the remaining part of your pancreas is connected to your small intestine. This\u00a0allows bile and the hormones and enzymes produced by the pancreas to still be released into\u00a0your system.\nAfter this type of surgery, about one in three people need to take enzymes to help them digest food.\nThe Whipple procedure involves long and intensive surgery, but it's easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy.\nA distal pancreatectomy involves\u00a0removing the tail and body of your pancreas.\nYour spleen will usually also be removed at the same time. Part of your stomach, bowel, left adrenal gland, left kidney and left diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen) may also be removed.\nLike the Whipple procedure, a distal pancreatectomy is a long and complex operation\u00a0that won't be carried out\u00a0unless your doctor thinks it's necessary.\nDuring a total pancreatectomy, your entire pancreas will be removed. This is sometimes necessary due to the position of the tumour.\nYour surgeon will also remove your:\n\nbile duct\ngall bladder\nspleen\npart of your small intestine\npart of your stomach (sometimes)\nsurrounding lymph nodes (part of the immune system)\n\nAfter a total pancreatectomy, you'll need to take enzymes to help your digestive system digest food. You'll also have\u00a0diabetes\u00a0for the rest of your life because the pancreas produces insulin\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the hormone that regulates blood sugar.\nRemoving your spleen can increase your risk of developing infections and may also affect your blood's ability to clot. This means you'll be on penicillin (or an alternative antibiotic if you're allergic to it) for the rest of your life, and you'll need to have regular vaccinations.\nSometimes, you may need to take tablets for a short period to stop the platelets in your blood sticking to each other. Platelets are a type of blood\u00a0cell\u00a0that cause your blood to clot (thicken).\nAlthough surgery may not be a suitable way of removing your tumour, you may be offered\u00a0it to help ease your symptoms.\nThis type of surgery won't cure your cancer, but will mean that your condition is easier to manage, and it will make you more comfortable.\nTo help control jaundice, a stent can be placed in your bile duct using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This will help keep the bile duct open and prevent bilirubin\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the yellow chemical in bile\u00a0\u2013\u00a0from building up and causing jaundice.\nIf a stent isn't a suitable option for you, you may need an operation to bypass your blocked bile duct. Your surgeon will cut the bile duct just above the blockage and reconnect it to your intestine, which allows your bile to drain away.\nThese types of surgery are much less intensive than surgery carried out on the pancreas. The recovery time is much quicker, and\u00a0people find that their\u00a0jaundice improves significantly.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0is a type of cancer treatment that uses anti-cancer medicines to either kill the cancerous (malignant) cells in your body or stop them\u00a0multiplying.\nChemotherapy treatment is often used alongside surgery and radiotherapy (see below) to help ensure that as much of the cancer is treated as possible.\nChemotherapy may be given:\n\nbefore surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to try to shrink the cancer, so there's a greater chance of the surgeon being able to remove all of the cancer\nafter surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back\nwhen surgery isn't possible\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to try to shrink the cancer, slow its growth and relieve your symptoms\n\nSome chemotherapy medicines can be taken orally (by mouth), but some need to be given directly into a vein (intravenously).\nChemotherapy also attacks\u00a0normal, healthy cells, which is why this type of treatment can have many side effects. The most common side effects include:\n\nvomiting\nnausea\nmouth sores\nfatigue\nincreased risk of infection\u00a0\n\nThese are usually only temporary, and should improve once you've completed your treatment.\nThe chemotherapy medications can also be used in combination, so your doctor may suggest using one medication or a combination of 2 or 3.\nCombining chemotherapy medications can give a better chance of shrinking or controlling the cancer, but increases the chance of side effects.\u00a0Sometimes, the risks of chemotherapy can outweigh the potential benefits.\nRead more about chemotherapy\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0is a form of cancer therapy that uses high-energy beams of\u00a0radiation to help shrink your tumour and relieve pain.\nSide effects of radiotherapy\u00a0can include:\n\nfatigue\nskin rashes\nloss of appetite\ndiarrhoea\nnausea or vomiting\u00a0\n\nThese side effects are usually only temporary, and should improve after your treatment has been completed.\nRead more about radiotherapy\n\n\nIn its early stages, pancreatic cancer rarely causes symptoms.\nThe pancreas is actually 2 glands in one, and symptoms depend on which part is affected. This is because:\n\nthe exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which break down food so they can be absorbed by your body\nthe endocrine pancreas produces hormones \u2013 including insulin, which keeps your blood sugar levels stable\n\nMost cases\u00a0of pancreatic cancer are\u00a0in the exocrine pancreas, and the 3 most common symptoms are:\n\npain in the stomach or\u00a0back\njaundice\nweight loss\n\nIt's important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different health conditions and aren't usually the result of cancer.\u00a0However, you should contact your GP if you're concerned, or if you\u00a0suddenly develop these symptoms.\nPain in the stomach or\u00a0back\nPancreatic cancer can cause a dull pain in your upper tummy (abdomen), which may\u00a0spread to your back.\nTo begin with, the pain may come and go, but as the tumour becomes larger and more advanced, the pain may be more constant and last longer.\nThe pain is often worse when you lie down or after you've eaten. You may also have pain or tenderness in your abdomen if your liver, pancreas or gallbladder are enlarged.\nWeight loss\nMany types of cancer cause weight loss, because the cancerous cells deprive your healthy cells of the nutrients they need.\nPancreatic cancer is more likely to cause weight loss than some other cancers because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which help food to be absorbed into your body.\nIf a tumour disrupts that production, your body will find it harder to digest food, particularly high-fat foods.\nThis can cause you to lose weight and become malnourished\nJaundice\nJaundice is caused by a build-up of a yellowish-brown substance called bilirubin in the blood and tissues of the body.\nThe most obvious sign of jaundice is yellow skin and yellowing of the whites of the eyes. It also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured.\nBilirubin is a waste product produced by the liver, and passed out of the body through the bile duct and\u00a0into the intestine.\nJaundice is more often a sign of conditions such as gallstones\u00a0or hepatitis\u00a0than it is of cancer.\nHowever, a tumour can sometimes develop in the head of the pancreas and block the bile duct, causing bilirubin to build up\u00a0in the body.\nDiabetes\nThe pancreas produces the\u00a0hormone\u00a0insulin. Without it, the body can't move glucose (sugar) out of the blood and into your cells.\nThe main symptoms of diabetes include:\n\nexcessive thirst\nurinating frequently \u2013 particularly at night\u00a0\nextreme tiredness\u00a0\nweight loss and loss of muscle bulk\n\nYou may develop diabetes\u00a0if you have\u00a0pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.\nOther possible symptoms\nOther possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:\n\nitching (if you have jaundice)\nnausea and vomiting\nbowel changes\nfever and shivering\nindigestion\nblood clots\n\nEndocrine pancreatic cancer\nEndocrine pancreatic tumours, also known as neuroendocrine tumours, are uncommon.\nThere are a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces.\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the symptoms of endocrine pancreatic tumours.\n\n\nThe exact cause of pancreatic cancer isn't fully understood. However, there are a number of risk factors\u00a0that can increase your chances of developing it.\nAge\nPancreatic cancer can affect people of any age, but it\u00a0mainly affects people who are aged 50 to 80. Almost 50% of people diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas are aged 75 or over.\nSmoking\nResearch has found that about one in three cases of pancreatic cancer is associated with\u00a0smoking and other tobacco use.\nSmoking cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco can all increase your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas.\nThis is because tobacco smoke contains harmful chemicals and toxins that can cause irritation and inflammation\u00a0within your body's organs and\u00a0tissues.\nDiabetes\nIf you have\u00a0diabetes, your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is thought to be\u00a0increased.\nHowever, it's important to remember that diabetes is very common and most people with diabetes won't develop pancreatic cancer.\nAs well as diabetes being a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, it's also thought that a cancerous tumour that grows in the pancreas could be responsible for some cases of diabetes.\nChronic pancreatitis and hereditary pancreatitis\nChronic\u00a0pancreatitis\u00a0(long-term inflammation of the pancreas) increases your risk of getting pancreatic cancer, but\u00a0isn't responsible for many cases. Chronic pancreatitis is often caused by long-term alcohol misuse.\u00a0\nAlthough it's a very\u00a0rare condition, if you have hereditary pancreatitis, your\u00a0risk of developing pancreatic cancer is 50 times greater than the rest of the population.\nHelicobacter pylori infection\nHelicobacter pylori are bacteria that cause stomach ulcers, and is a known risk factor for stomach cancer.\nResearch has shown that a Helicobacter pylori infection may slightly\u00a0increase your risk of getting pancreatic cancer. However, the risk is thought to be small because most people with\u00a0this infection don't get cancer of the pancreas.\nOther known risk factors\nThere are also a number of other factors that have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. These are:\n\nlong-term hepatitis\ntooth or gum disease\nheavy alcohol use\na previous history of certain types of cancer\npreviously having radiotherapy\ndiet,\u00a0weight and level of physical activity\n\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has\u00a0more information about these other possible risk factors for pancreatic cancer.\n\n\nIn the early stages, pancreatic cancer often causes no symptoms. This can make it difficult to diagnose.\nIf you visit your GP with symptoms of pancreatic cancer,\u00a0they will probably examine your eyes and skin for signs of jaundice.\nThey may also test your urine for bile, or carry out a blood test. This is because jaundice can sometimes be a sign of pancreatic cancer.\nYour GP may also examine your tummy (abdomen) to feel for any swelling or abnormality. The pancreas is quite well-hidden within the body because it's covered by part of the bowel. This can make it difficult to feel for tumours during a physical examination.\nIf\u00a0your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you'll be referred for further testing at a hospital.\u00a0\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nUltrasound scan\nAn\u00a0ultrasound scan\u00a0is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your body.\nIf\u00a0pancreatic cancer is suspected, you'll be referred for an ultrasound scan of your abdomen to see if your pancreas appears abnormal.\nHowever, this type of scan can often miss pancreatic cancer, because ultrasound waves aren't very good\u00a0at penetrating deep into body tissues.\u00a0\nComputerised tomography (CT) scan\nA\u00a0computerised tomography (CT)\u00a0scan produces a detailed image of the inside of your body using a series of\u00a0X-ray\u00a0images.\nYour doctor can use the results of a CT\u00a0scan to check for abnormalities and assess the size of the tumour.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\nA\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan also produces an image of the inside of your body, but it uses strong magnetic and radio waves instead of X-rays.\nMRI scans are carried out in a tube-shaped\u00a0MRI scanner. It's a noisy procedure that\u00a0can feel claustrophobic. It also takes longer than other types of\u00a0scans.\nLike a CT scan, an MRI scan allows your doctor to check for signs of\u00a0cancer in other parts of the body.\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scan\nA positron emission tomography (PET) scan can help to show where the cancer is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.\nBefore the scan, you'll be given an injection of a very small amount of a radioactive medication, known as\u00a0a tracer. The amount of\u00a0radiation is very small and no more than you would receive from a normal X-ray.\u00a0\nThe most common tracer used is a radioactive form of glucose (sugar).\u00a0You'll then rest for about an hour to allow the tracer to travel to areas in your body where glucose is used for energy.\nThe scan itself can take up to an hour and produces an image of the tracer in your body. The tracer shows up cancers because they use glucose in a different way to normal tissue.\nEndoluminal ultrasonography (EUS)\nIf a small shadow is seen on a CT or MRI scan but it's not obvious what it\u00a0is, another test called endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) can be carried out.\nDuring EUS, a thin, flexible\u00a0instrument called\u00a0an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach.\nAn ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope will then be used to take close-up pictures of your pancreas.\nBefore the procedure, you may be given a sedative to help you relax. EUS can also be used to take a biopsy\u00a0for further examination.\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure used to insert a plastic tube or stent into the bile duct if\u00a0someone has\u00a0jaundice.\nDuring ERCP, an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. The endoscope can then be used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts.\nAfter the dye has been injected, an X-ray will be taken. The dye will show up on the X-ray and will highlight any tumour that's blocking the bile and pancreatic ducts.\nDuring the procedure, tissue samples may be taken. These samples can be looked at under a microscope to see whether the cells are cancerous.\nERCP can take 30 to 60 minutes. As with EUS, you'll usually be given a sedative to help you relax.\nLaparoscopy\nA\u00a0laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen and pelvis.\nDuring the procedure, a small\u00a0incision will be made in your abdomen, and a laparoscope (a thin,\u00a0flexible microscope) will be inserted.\nThis will allow the surgeon to see inside your body and make sure the tumour hasn't spread before recommending its removal.\nThis procedure will be carried out\u00a0under a\u00a0general anaesthetic (where you're put to sleep so you don't feel any pain or discomfort).\nBiopsy\nA\u00a0biopsy\u00a0involves taking a sample from a suspected tumour, which\u00a0can then be tested to see if it's cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).\nA biopsy can be carried out during an EUS, ERCP or laparoscopy using\u00a0a small instrument attached to the endoscope to collect a number of cells.\nIt's also possible for a\u00a0biopsy to be carried out using a long, thin needle that's passed through your abdomen. The needle will be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound or CT scan.\n\n\nRecovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process.\nYou'll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief.\nAfter any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won't be able to eat or drink straight away.\nYou'll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may\u00a0be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation.\nAfter the tumour has been removed, you will probably have a 6-month course of chemotherapy, which greatly increases your chance of being cured. However, as cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don't recover\u00a0completely.\nTreatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Panic disorder is where you have recurring and regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason.\nEveryone experiences feelings of\u00a0anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. It's a natural response to stressful or\u00a0dangerous situations.\nHowever, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time.\nAnxiety\nAnxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including\n\nphobias\u00a0\u2013 an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal\ngeneralised anxiety disorder (GAD) \u2013 a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations\npost-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening events\n\nPanic attacks\nA panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms.\nYou may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. As well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as:\n\nnausea\nsweating\ntrembling\na sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)\n\nThe number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week.\nRead more about the symptoms of panic disorder.\nPanic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they're not dangerous. An attack won't cause you any physical harm, and it's unlikely that you'll be admitted to hospital if you've had a panic attack.\nWhat causes panic disorder?\nAs with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood.\nHowever, it's thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors.\nRead about the possible causes of panic disorder.\nIt\u2019s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety. For example:\n\nmitral valve prolapse\npostural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (POTS)\nanaemia\nparoxysmal atrial tachycardia \u2013 episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly\nthyrotoxicosis \u2013 where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat, sweating, tremor and anxiety\npoorly controlled diabetes\nadrenal tumours \u2013 growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys)\ncarcinoid syndrome \u2013 a set of symptoms caused by some carcinoid tumours that can develop in the cells of the endocrine system (glands that produce and secrete hormones)\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome \u2013 causes overproduction of insulin and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)\n\nDiagnosing panic disorder\nSee your GP if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above).\nYou may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.\nRead more about how panic disorder is diagnosed.\nTreating panic disorder\nThe aim of treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease the severity of your symptoms.\nPsychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.\nRead more about treating panic disorder and things you can do to help yourself during a panic attack.\nHaving panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. It's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability.\nGOV.UK has further information and advice about driving with a disability or health condition.\nComplications of panic disorder\nPanic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it's important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. Treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it's given at an early stage.\nLeft untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other phobias.\nAgoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn't be available if things go wrong.\nRead more about the complications of panic disorder.\n\n\nThe symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.\nSymptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason.\nAs well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other\u00a0symptoms, including:\n\na sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)\nsweating\ntrembling\nhot flushes\nchills\nshortness of breath\u00a0\na choking sensation\nchest pain\nnausea\ndizziness\nfeeling\u00a0faint\nnumbness or\u00a0pins and needles\ndry mouth\na need to go to the toilet\nringing in your ears\u00a0\na feeling of dread or a fear of dying\na churning stomach\na tingling sensation in your fingers\nshivering\nshaking\n\nThe physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror.\nFor this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which\u00a0creates a\u00a0cycle of living in \u2018fear of fear\u2019 and adds to the sense of panic.\nSometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you're having a heart attack.\nHowever, it's important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won't result in you having a heart attack. Although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don't cause any physical harm. People who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this 'heart attack sensation' and\u00a0become more aware of how to control their symptoms.\nMost panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes.\u00a0Some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. However, it's likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack.\nRecurrent panic attacks\nPeople with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week.\nPeople with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. The panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable.\nIf you have panic disorder, you may also\u00a0feel\u00a0anxious about when your next attack will be.\nDepersonalisation\nDuring a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can\u00a0feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. It can almost feel as if you're an observer, making the situation seem very unreal.\nThis sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. Being detached from the situation doesn't provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. Instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating.\n\n\nAs with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood.\nIt's thought that panic disorder is probably caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. Some of these factors are outlined below.\nTraumatic life experiences\nA trauma, such as bereavement, can sometimes trigger feelings of panic and anxiety. These feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later.\nGenetics\nHaving a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person's risk of developing it. However, the precise nature of the risk isn't known.\nNeurotransmitters\nNeurotransmitters are chemicals that occur naturally in the brain. It's thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder.\nIncreased sensitivity to carbon dioxide\nSome experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. Breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks.\nCatastrophic thinking\nAnother theory is that people who experience panic attacks tend to focus on\u00a0minor physical symptoms and interpret them in a catastrophic way. This triggers a nervous system response that causes the panic attack.\n\n\nEveryone who has panic disorder will experience panic attacks.\nHowever, not everyone who has\u00a0panic attacks is diagnosed with panic disorder.\nPanic attacks\nSome people have panic attacks in response to specific situations. For example, they may have a phobia (overwhelming fear) of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) and have a panic attack when faced with an enclosed space.\nWhile most people with\u00a0phobias only experience panic attacks when faced with the thing that\u00a0triggers their fear, the panic attacks of people with panic disorder usually occur without warning and for no obvious reason.\nThis means that panic disorder will only be diagnosed after experiencing recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, and if the attacks are followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.\nTalk to your GP\nYour GP will ask you to describe the symptoms you've been experiencing. They'll also ask you how often your symptoms occur and in what situations.\nIt's important to tell your GP about how you've been feeling and how your symptoms have affected you.\nAlthough it can sometimes be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life,\u00a0try not to feel anxious or embarrassed.\nYour GP needs to gain a good understanding of your symptoms to\u00a0make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment for you.\nPhysical examination\nYour GP may also want to carry out a physical examination to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.\nFor example, an\u00a0overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause similar symptoms to a panic attack.\nBy ruling out any underlying medical conditions, your GP will be able to make the correct diagnosis.\n\n\nThe main aim in treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks and ease the severity of symptoms.\nPsychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.\nDepending on your individual circumstances, you may need one of these treatment types or a combination of the two.\nIf you're offered psychological therapy, it will probably be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If this doesn't work, medication may be recommended.\nBefore starting any form of treatment, your GP will discuss all of the options with you, outlining the advantages of each type and making you aware of any possible risks or side effects.\nNo single treatment works for everyone and you may need to try a number of treatments before finding one that works for you. The treatment that's recommended will depend on your general level of health, the severity of your condition and your personal preferences.\nIt's important you understand what your treatment will involve. If you don't understand something your GP has told you, ask them to explain it in more detail.\nCognitive behavioural therapy\nPsychological therapy has proven long-term benefits and it's recommended for treating panic disorder. It will usually take the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nCBT is thought to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for panic disorder. It involves having regular sessions with a therapist.\nThe therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about when you're experiencing an attack.\nOnce you and your therapist have identified any negative thoughts and beliefs, you can work on replacing them with more realistic and balanced ones. Your therapist can also teach you ways of changing your behaviour, making it easier for you to deal with future panic attacks.\nFor example, they may be able to show you breathing techniques that can be used to help keep you calm during a panic attack.\nThe\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a total of seven to 14 hours of CBT to be completed within a four month period. Treatment will usually involve having a weekly one to two hour session.\nNICE also recommends that in certain situations a shorter programme of CBT may be appropriate. This can involve a reduced number of hours of CBT with \u2018homework\u2019 being set between sessions so that you can practice what you've learnt after each session.\nYou should visit your GP regularly\u00a0while you're having CBT so that they can assess your progress and see how you're doing.\nSupport groups\nSupport groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. They're also a good way of meeting other people who've had similar experiences of the condition.\nPanic attacks can sometimes be frightening and isolating, so it can be helpful to know that other people are experiencing the same feelings and emotions as you.\nAnxiety UK and Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK) are UK-based charities that provide information and support for people with anxiety disorders.\nSupport groups often involve face-to-face meetings where you can talk about your problems and difficulties with others. Many can also provide support and guidance over the telephone or in writing.\nAsk your GP about support groups for panic disorder near you. You can also use the services directory to\u00a0find anxiety services in your area.\nAntidepressants\nAntidepressants\u00a0are often associated with depression, but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions.\nAntidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective. It's therefore important to continue taking them, even if you feel they're\u00a0not working. You should only ever stop taking prescribed medication if your GP specifically advises you to do so.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants are two types of antidepressants that are often recommended for treating\u00a0panic disorder.\nWhen starting a new type of medication, you should be regularly assessed by your GP at two, four, six and 12 week intervals. This will allow you to discuss any issues that you have with your medication, and enables your GP to assess which treatment is most effective. It will also provide you with the opportunity to try a different type of medication if you want to.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u00a0(SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain.\nThey're the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant for treating panic disorder. They're usually started at a low dose before gradually being increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.\nCommon side effects of SSRIs include:\n\nnausea\nheadaches\u00a0\nlow sex drive\u00a0(loss of libido)\nblurred vision\ndiarrhoea\u00a0or\u00a0constipation\ndizziness\ndry mouth\u00a0\nloss of appetite\nsweating\nfeeling agitated\ninsomnia\u00a0(sleep problems)\nabdominal pain\n\nWhen you first start taking SSRIs, your feelings of\u00a0anxiety and panic may get slightly worse. In most cases, this is temporary and your symptoms will start to return to normal levels within a few days of taking the medicine.\nSpeak to your GP if you feel that your symptoms have got worse and that they're not showing signs of returning to normal levels after a few days.\nAfter you start to take a SSRI, you should visit your GP after two, four, six, and 12 weeks so that they can check on your progress and see whether you're responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it's important that your progress is carefully monitored.\nIf your GP feels it necessary, you may require regular\u00a0blood tests or blood pressure checks when taking antidepressants. If after 12 weeks of taking the medication you don't show any signs of improvement, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI to see if it has any effect.\nThe length of time that you'll have to take a SSRI for will vary depending on how well you respond to the treatment. Even if you feel that your panic disorder has been successfully treated, it's likely that you'll need to keep taking the medication for at least six to 12 months.\nIf you stop taking your medication before this time, the risk of your symptoms recurring may be increased. Some people may have to take SSRIs for longer than the usual six to 12 month period.\nWhen you and your GP decide that it's appropriate for you to stop taking SSRIs, you will gradually be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. As with antidepressants, you should never stop taking SSRIs\u00a0unless your GP specifically advises you to.\nStopping your medication straight away without being weaned off, or without seeking advice from your GP, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as:\n\ndizziness\nnumbness and tingling\nnausea and vomiting\nheadache\nanxiety\nsleep disturbances\nsweating\n\nThese symptoms can also occur if you miss a dose of medication, or if your dose is reduced. The symptoms are usually mild, but they can be severe if the medication is stopped suddenly.\nFor some people, this means having to take SSRIs on a long-term basis. For others, a course of CBT can help to reduce the risk of their symptoms recurring.\nContact your GP if you experience troublesome side effects that\u00a0don't ease.\nIf SSRIs aren't suitable, or if your symptoms don't improve after a 12 week course of SSRIs, your GP may try prescribing a different type of antidepressant.\nTricyclic antidepressants work in a similar way to SSRIs. They regulate the levels of the chemicals noradrenaline and serotonin in your brain, which has a positive effect on your feelings and mood.\nImipramine\u00a0and\u00a0clomipramine are two tricyclic antidepressants that are often prescribed to treat panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants aren't addictive.\nSSRIs are usually prescribed before tricyclic antidepressants because they have fewer side effects. Common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants include:\n\nconstipation\ndifficulty urinating\nblurred vision\ndry mouth\nweight gain or weight loss\ndrowsiness\nsweating\nlightheadedness\nskin rash\n\nThe side effects should ease after seven to 10\u00a0days as your body starts to get used to the medication. However, see your GP if they become troublesome and don't ease.\nPregabalin\nPregabalin is another medication that\u2019s often used to treat panic disorder. It\u2019s an anticonvulsant that's also used to treat\u00a0epilepsy (a condition that causes repeated seizures). However, it's also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety.\nSide effects of pregabalin can include:\n\ndrowsiness\ndizziness\nincreased appetite and weight gain\nblurred vision\nheadaches\ndry mouth\nvertigo \u2013 the sensation that you, or the environment around you, are moving or spinning\n\nPregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs.\nClonazepam\nClonazepam is another medication that\u2019s often used to treat epilepsy and is also sometimes prescribed for panic disorder.\nIt can cause a wide variety of side effects including lethargy (lack of energy), abnormal eye movement (nystagmus), confusion and allergic reactions.\nReferral\nYou may be referred to a mental health specialist if treatments such as attending a support group, CBT and medication don't improve your symptoms of panic disorder.\nA mental health specialist will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. They'll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it. They may also ask you about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends.\nThe specialist will be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to effectively treat your symptoms. The type of mental health specialist that you'll be referred to will depend on your individual situation. For example, you may be referred to a:\n\npsychiatrist \u2013 a trained medical doctor who specialises in mental health; a psychiatrist is one of the only mental health specialists who is able to prescribe medication\nclinical psychologist \u2013 who is trained in the scientific study of human behaviour and mental processes and focuses solely on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; a clinical psychologist will help you to find ways of effectively managing your anxiety and panic attacks\n\n\n\nThere are several self-help techniques you can use to help treat the symptoms of panic disorder yourself.\nSome of these techniques are listed below.\nStay where you are\nIf possible, you should stay where you are during a panic attack. The attack could last up to an hour, so you may need to pull over and park where it's safe to do so if you're driving.\nFocus\nIf you have a panic attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations will eventually pass.\nDuring an attack, try to focus on something that's non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket.\nSlow deep breathing\nWhile you're having a panic attack, try to focus on your breathing. Feelings of panic and\u00a0anxiety can get worse if you breathe too quickly. Try breathing slowly and deeply while counting to three on each breath in and out.\nChallenge your fear\nWhen you have a panic attack, try to identify what it is you fear and challenge it. You can achieve this by constantly reminding yourself that what you fear isn't real and that it will pass in a few minutes.\u00a0\nCreative visualisation\nMany things can go through your mind during a panic attack \u2013 for example, some people think about disaster or death. Instead of focusing on negative thoughts, try to concentrate on positive images.\nThink of a place or a situation that makes you feel peaceful, relaxed or at ease. Once you have this image in your mind, try to focus your attention on it. It should help distract you from the situation and may also help ease your symptoms.\nThinking positively can be difficult, particularly if you've got used to thinking negatively over a long period of time. Creative visualisation is a technique that requires practice, but you may gradually notice positive changes in the way you think about yourself and others.\nDon't fight a panic attack\nFighting a panic attack can often make it worse. Trying to resist the attack and finding you're unable to can increase your sense of anxiety and panic.\nInstead, during a panic attack, reassure yourself by accepting that although it may seem embarrassing, and your symptoms may be difficult to deal with, the attack isn't life-threatening. Focus on the fact that the attack will evetually end and try your best to let it pass.\nRelaxation\nIf you have panic disorder, you may feel constantly stressed and anxious, particularly about when your next panic attack may be. Learning to relax can help to relieve some of this tension, and it may also help you to deal more effectively with your panic attacks when they occur.\nSome people find complementary therapies, such as massage and aromatherapy, help them to relax. Activities, such as yoga and pilates, can also be helpful. You can also practise breathing and relaxation techniques, which you can use during a panic attack to help ease your symptoms.\nExercise\nRegular exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, will help reduce stress and release tension. It can also encourage your brain to release the chemical serotonin, which can help improve your mood.\nIt's\u00a0recommended that adults aged 19-64 years should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast\u00a0walking, every week.\nThey should also do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms).\nVisit your GP for a fitness assessment before starting a new exercise programme if you haven't exercised before or for a long time.\nRead more about the physical activity guidelines for adults.\nDiet\nUnstable blood sugar levels can contribute to the symptoms of a panic attack. Therefore, you should maintain a healthy, balanced diet, eat regularly and avoid eating sugary food and drinks. Also, avoid caffeine, alcohol and smoking because they can all contribute to panic attacks.\n\n\nPanic disorder is a treatable condition, but to make a full recovery it's very important you seek medical help as soon as possible.\nThis is because treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it's given at an early stage.\nLeft undiagnosed and untreated, panic disorder can become a debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other psychological conditions.\nAgoraphobia and other phobias\nAgoraphobia\u00a0is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn't be available if things go wrong.\nIf you have agoraphobia, leaving home, going out in public and travelling alone can cause intense anxiety. Many people with agoraphobia avoid everyday activities because of their phobia.\nAgoraphobia is\u00a0one of the\u00a0conditions that can develop alongside panic disorder. People with panic disorder can develop agoraphobia because of their fear of having a panic attack in a public place.\nYou may worry that a panic attack in a public place will be embarrassing, or that you'll have difficulty getting help if you need it. You may also worry about public places that you would have difficulty leaving, such as a train, if you were to have a panic\u00a0attack.\nIf you have agoraphobia, you may find it difficult to leave the house, particularly if you're not with a trusted family member or a friend.\nIf you have panic disorder, you may also develop other fears and\u00a0phobias, which can often seem irrational. For example, you may start to worry about a particular object or action that triggers your attacks and become fearful of those things.\nChildren\nPanic disorder is more common in teenagers than in younger children.\nPanic attacks can be particularly debilitating for children and young people. Severe panic disorder may affect their development and learning. The fear of having a panic attack may stop children from going to school and engaging in a social life. They may also find it difficult to concentrate on their schoolwork.\nDiagnosing panic disorder\u00a0in children is usually a case of taking a detailed medical history and carrying out a thorough physical examination\u00a0to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms.\nScreening for other anxiety disorders may also be needed to help determine what's causing your child\u2019s panic attacks.\nPanic attacks in children are often dramatic events, including screaming and crying and an increased breathing rate (hyperventilation).\nIf your child displays the signs and symptoms of panic disorder over a prolonged period of time, your GP may refer them to a specialist for further assessment and treatment.\nThe specialist may recommend a course of psychotherapy\u00a0for your child, such as\u00a0cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nDrug and alcohol misuse\nSome studies have shown that conditions that cause intense anxiety, such as panic disorder, can also increase your risk of developing an alcohol or drug problem.\nThe side effects or withdrawal symptoms of both prescribed medication and\u00a0illegal drugs can increase the symptoms of anxiety.\nSmoking and caffeine can also make your anxiety symptoms worse, so you should try to\u00a0give up smoking (if you smoke) and limit the amount of caffeine in your diet.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Parkinson's disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over\u00a0many years.\nThe three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are:\n\ninvoluntary shaking of particular parts of the body (tremor)\nslow movement\nstiff and inflexible muscles\n\nA person with Parkinson's disease can also experience a wide range of other physical and psychological symptoms, including:\n\ndepression\u00a0and anxiety\nbalance problems\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this\u00a0may increase the chance of a fall\nloss of sense of smell anosmis\nproblems sleeping (insomnia)\nmemory problems\n\nRead more about the symptoms of Parkinson's disease\nSeeking medical advice\nSee your GP if you're concerned that you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nYour GP will ask about the problems you're experiencing and may\u00a0refer you to a specialist for further tests.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing Parkinson's disease\nCauses of Parkinson's disease\nParkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This\u00a0leads to a reduction\u00a0in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.\nDopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nExactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible.\nRead more about the causes of Parkinson's disease\nWho's affected?\nIt's thought around 1 in 500 people are affected by Parkinson's disease, which means\u00a0there are an estimated 127,000 people in the UK with the condition.\nMost people with Parkinson's start to develop symptoms when they're over 50, although around 1 in 20 people with the condition first experience symptoms\u00a0when they're under 40.\nMen are slightly more likely to get Parkinson's disease than women.\nTreating\u00a0Parkinson's disease\nAlthough there's currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible.\nThese include:\n\nsupportive treatments\u00a0\u2013 such as physiotherapy\u00a0and occupational therapy\nmedication\nin some cases, brain\u00a0surgery\n\nYou may not need any treatment during the early stages of Parkinson's disease, as symptoms are usually mild.

Some of the more common symptoms are described below.\nHowever,\u00a0the order in which these develop and their severity is different for each individual.\u00a0It's unlikely that\u00a0a person\u00a0with Parkinson's disease would experience all or\u00a0most of these.\nMain symptoms\nThe three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease affect physical movement:\n\ntremor\u00a0\u2013 shaking, which usually begins in the hand or arm and is more likely to occur when the limb is relaxed and\u00a0resting\nslowness of movement (bradykinesia) \u2013 where physical movements are much slower than normal, which can make everyday tasks difficult and can result in a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps\nmuscle stiffness (rigidity) \u2013 stiffness and tension in the muscles, which can make it difficult to move around and make facial expressions, and can result in painful muscle cramps (dystonia)\n\nThese main\u00a0symptoms are sometimes referred to by doctors as parkinsonism as there can be causes other than Parkinson's disease.\nOther symptoms\nParkinson's disease can also cause a range of other physical and mental symptoms.\nPhysical symptoms\n\nbalance problems \u2013 these can make someone with the condition more likely to have a fall and injure themselves\nloss of sense of smell (anosmia)\u00a0\u2013 sometimes occurs several years before other symptoms develop\nnerve pain \u2013\u00a0can cause unpleasant sensations, such as burning, coldness or numbness\nproblems with urination \u2013 such as having to get up frequently during the night to urinate or\u00a0unintentionally passing urine (urinary incontinence)\nconstipation\nan inability to obtain or sustain an erection (erectile dysfunction)\u00a0in men\u00a0\ndifficulty becoming sexually aroused and achieving an orgasm\u00a0(sexual dysfunction) in women\ndizziness, blurred vision or fainting\u00a0when moving from a sitting or lying position to a standing one\u00a0\u2013\u00a0caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure\nexcessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)\nswallowing difficulties (dysphagia)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can lead to malnutrition and dehydration\nexcessive production of saliva (drooling)\nproblems sleeping (insomnia)\u00a0\u2013 this can result in excessive sleepiness during the day\n\nCognitive and psychiatric symptoms\n\ndepression and anxiety\nmild cognitive impairment \u2013 slight memory problems and problems with activities that require planning and organisation\ndementia \u2013 a group of symptoms, including more severe memory problems, personality changes,\u00a0seeing things that aren't there (visual hallucinations) and\u00a0believing things that aren't true (delusions)\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nSee your GP if you're concerned you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and your medical history to help them decide whether it's necessary to refer you to a specialist for further tests.\nRead more about diagnosing Parkinson's disease\n\n\nParkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra.\nNerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger between the parts of the brain and nervous system that help control and co-ordinate body movements.\nIf these nerve cells die or become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means the part of the brain controlling movement can't work as well as normal, causing movements to become slow and abnormal.\nThe loss of nerve cells is a slow process.\u00a0The symptoms of Parkinson's disease\u00a0usually only start to develop when around 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost.\nWhat causes the loss of nerve cells?\nIt's not known why the loss of nerve cells associated with Parkinson's disease occurs, although research is ongoing to identify potential causes.\nCurrently, it's believed a combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be responsible for the condition.\nA number of genetic\u00a0factors have been shown to\u00a0increase a person's risk of developing Parkinson's disease, although exactly how these make some people more susceptible to the condition is unclear.\nParkinson's disease can run in families as a result of faulty genes being passed to\u00a0a child by their parents. However, it's rare for the disease to be inherited this way.\nSome researchers also feel environmental factors may increase a person's risk of developing Parkinson's disease.\nIt's been suggested that pesticides and herbicides used in farming\u00a0and traffic or industrial pollution may contribute to the condition.\nHowever, the evidence linking environmental factors to Parkinson's disease is inconclusive.\nOther causes of parkinsonism\n\"Parkinsonism\" is the umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of tremors, muscle rigidity and slowness of movement.\nParkinson's disease is the most common type of parkinsonism, but there are also some rarer types where a specific cause can be identified.\nThese include parkinsonism caused by:\n\nmedication (drug-induced parkinsonism) \u2013 where symptoms develop after taking certain medications, such as some types of antipsychotic medication, and usually improve once the medication is stopped\nother progressive brain conditions \u2013 such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple systems atrophy, and\u00a0corticobasal degeneration\ncerebrovascular disease \u2013 where a series of small strokes cause several parts of the brain to die\n\nYou can read more about parkinsonism on the Parkinson's UK website.\n\n\nNo tests can conclusively show that you have Parkinson's disease. Your doctor will base a diagnosis on your symptoms, medical history and a detailed physical examination.\nYour GP will\u00a0talk to\u00a0you\u00a0about the problems you're experiencing and may\u00a0ask you to perform some simple mental or physical tasks, such as moving or walking around,\u00a0to help with the diagnosis.\nIn the early stages, your GP may find it difficult to say whether you definitely have the condition because symptoms are usually mild.\nReferral to a specialist\nIf your GP suspects Parkinson's disease, you'll be referred to a specialist. This will usually be:\n\na neurologist \u2013 a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system\na geriatrician \u2013 a specialist in problems affecting elderly people\n\nIf your GP thinks you may be in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, you should see a specialist within six weeks. If they think you may be in the later stages, you should see a specialist within two weeks.\nThe specialist will most likely ask you to perform a number of physical exercises so they can assess whether you have any problems with movement.\nA diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is likely if you have at least two of the three following symptoms:\n\nshaking or tremor in a part of your body that usually only occurs at rest\nslowness of movement (bradykinesia)\nmuscle stiffness (rigidity)\n\nIf your symptoms improve after taking a medication called levodopa, it's more likely you have Parkinson's disease.\nSpecial brain scans, such as a\u00a0single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan, may also be carried out in some cases\u00a0to try to\u00a0rule out\u00a0other causes of\u00a0your symptoms.\nReceiving the diagnosis\nBeing told you have Parkinson's disease can be emotionally distressing, and the news can often be difficult to take in.\nThis means it's important that you have the support of your family and a care team who will be able to help you come to terms with the diagnosis.\nYou may find it useful to contact\u00a0Parkinson's UK,\u00a0the Parkinson's support and research charity.\nThey can be contacted by:\n\nfree helpline on 0808 800 0303 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm, and 10am to 2pm on\u00a0Saturdays)\nemail: hello@parkinsons.org.uk\n\nParkinson's UK\u00a0brings people with Parkinson's, their carers and families together through\u00a0a network of local groups, as well as online resources and a confidential helpline.\nThe Parkinson's UK website provides information and support on every aspect of living with Parkinson's.\n\n\nThere are several therapies that can make living with Parkinson's disease easier and help you deal with your symptoms on a day-to-day basis.\nThere are efforts underway to try to increase the availability of these supportive therapies for Parkinson's patients on the NHS.\nYour local authority may be able to advise and help you. Ask your local authority for a care and support needs assessment.\nPhysiotherapy\nA physiotherapist can work with you to relieve muscle stiffness and joint pain through movement (manipulation) and exercise.\nThe physiotherapist aims to make moving easier, and improve your walking and flexibility. They also try to improve your fitness levels and ability to manage things for yourself.\nOccupational therapy\nAn occupational therapist can identify areas of difficulty in your everyday life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, dressing yourself or getting to the local shops.\nThey can help you work out practical solutions, and ensure your home is safe and properly set up for you. This will help you maintain your independence for as long as possible.\nRead more about occupational therapy\nSpeech and language therapy\nMany people with Parkinson's disease have swallowing difficulties (dysphagia)\u00a0and problems\u00a0with their speech.\nA speech and language therapist can often help\u00a0you improve these problems by teaching speaking and swallowing exercises, or by providing assistive technology.\nDiet advice\nFor some people with Parkinson's disease, making dietary changes can help improve some symptoms.\nThese changes\u00a0can include:\n\nincreasing the amount of fibre in your diet and making sure you're drinking enough fluid to reduce\u00a0constipation\nincreasing the amount of salt in your diet and eating small, frequent meals to avoid problems with\u00a0low blood pressure, such as\u00a0dizziness when you stand up quickly\nmaking changes to your diet to avoid\u00a0unintentional weight loss\n\nYou may see a dietitian, a healthcare professional trained to give diet advice, if your care team thinks you\u00a0may benefit from changing your diet.\nMedication\nMedication\u00a0can be used to\u00a0improve the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as shaking (tremors) and movement problems.\nHowever, not all the medications available are useful for everyone, and the short- and long-term effects of each are different.\nThree main types of medication are commonly used:\n\nlevodopa\ndopamine agonists\nmonoamine oxidase-B inhibitors\n\nYour specialist can explain your medication options, including the risks associated with each medication, and discuss which may be best for you. Regular reviews will be required as the condition progresses and your needs change.\nRead on to learn about the treatments you may be offered. You can also see a summary of the pros and cons of treatments for Parkinson's disease, where you can compare your options.\nMost people with Parkinson's disease eventually need a medication called levodopa.\nLevodopa is absorbed by the nerve cells in your brain and turned into the chemical dopamine, which is used to transmit messages between the parts of the brain and nerves that control movement.\nIncreasing the levels of dopamine using levodopa usually improves movement problems.\nIt\u00a0is usually taken as a tablet or liquid, and is often combined with other medication, such as benserazide or carbidopa.\nThese medications stop the levodopa being broken down in the bloodstream before it has a chance to get to the brain.\nThey also reduce the side effects of levodopa, which include:\n\nfeeling sick (nausea) or vomiting\ntiredness\ndizziness\n\nIf you're prescribed levodopa, the initial dose\u00a0is usually very small and will be gradually increased until it takes effect.\nAt first, levodopa can cause a dramatic improvement in the symptoms.\nHowever, its effects can be less long-lasting over the following years\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as more nerve cells in the brain are lost, there are fewer of them to absorb the medicine. This means the dose may need to be increased from time to time.\nLong-term use of levodopa is also linked to problems such as uncontrollable, jerky muscle movements (dyskinesias) and \"on-off\" effects, where the person rapidly switches between being able to move (on) and being immobile (off).\nDopamine agonists act as a substitute for dopamine in the brain and have a similar but milder effect compared\u00a0with levodopa. They can often be given less frequently than levodopa.\nThey\u00a0are often taken as a tablet, but are also available as a skin patch (rotigotine).\nSometimes dopamine agonists are taken at the same time as levodopa, as this allows lower doses of levodopa to be used.\nPossible side effects of dopamine agonists include:\n\nnausea or vomiting\ntiredness and sleepiness\ndizziness\n\nDopamine agonists can also cause hallucinations and\u00a0increased confusion, so they need to be used with caution, particularly in elderly patients, who are more susceptible.\nFor some people, dopamine agonists have been linked to the development of compulsive behaviours,\u00a0especially at high doses, including addictive gambling and an excessively increased libido.\nTalk to your healthcare specialist if you think you may be experiencing these problems.\nAs the person themselves may not realise the problem, it's key that carers and family members also note any abnormal behaviour and discuss it with an appropriate professional at the earliest opportunity.\nIf you're prescribed a course of dopamine agonists, the initial dose is usually very small to prevent nausea and other side effects.\nThe dosage is gradually increased over a few weeks. If nausea becomes a problem, your GP may prescribe anti-sickness medication.\nA potentially serious, but uncommon, complication of dopamine agonist therapy is sudden onset of sleep.\nThis generally happens as the dose is being increased and tends to settle once the dose is stable.\nPeople are\u00a0usually advised to\u00a0avoid driving while the dose is being increased in case this complication occurs.\nMonoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, including selegiline and rasagiline, are another alternative to levodopa for treating early Parkinson's disease.\u00a0\nThey block the effects of an enzyme or\u00a0brain substance that breaks down\u00a0dopamine (monoamine oxidase-B), increasing dopamine levels.\nBoth selegiline and rasagiline can improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, although their effects are small compared with levodopa. They can be used alongside levodopa or dopamine agonists.\nMAO-B inhibitors are generally very well tolerated, but can occasionally\u00a0cause side effects, including:\n\nnausea\nheadache\nabdominal pain\nhigh blood pressure\n\nCatechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are prescribed for people in later stages of Parkinson's disease. They prevent levodopa from being broken down by the enzyme COMT.\nSide effects of COMT inhibitors include:\n\nnausea or vomiting\ndiarrhoea\nabdominal pain\n\nNon-oral therapies\nWhen Parkinson's symptoms become difficult to control with tablets alone, a number of other treatments can be considered.\nA dopamine agonist called apomorphine can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) either\u00a0by:\n\na single injection, when required\na continuous infusion\u00a0using a small pump carried around on your belt, under your clothing, or in a bag\n\nIf you have severe on-off fluctuations, a type of levodopa called duodopa may be used.\nThis medication comes as a gel that's continuously pumped into your gut through a tube inserted through your abdominal wall.\nThere's an external pump attached to the end of the tube, which you carry around with you.\nAbout 25 specialist neuroscience centres in the UK offer this treatment.\u00a0This treatment is only available if you have very severe on-off fluctuations or involuntary movements.\nSurgery\nMost people with Parkinson's disease are treated with medication, although a type of surgery called deep brain stimulation is\u00a0used in some cases.\nThis surgery is also available in specialist neuroscience centres around the UK, but it's not suitable for everyone.\nIf\u00a0surgery is\u00a0being considered, your specialist will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.\nDeep brain stimulation\nDeep brain stimulation involves surgically implanting a pulse generator similar to a heart pacemaker into your chest wall.\nThis is connected to one or two fine wires placed under the skin, and is\u00a0inserted precisely into specific areas in your brain.\nA tiny electric current is produced\u00a0by the pulse generator, which runs through the wire and stimulates the part of your brain affected by Parkinson's disease.\nAlthough surgery doesn't cure Parkinson's disease, it can ease the symptoms for some people.\nTreating additional symptoms\nAs well as\u00a0the main symptoms of movement problems, people with Parkinson's disease can experience a wide range of additional symptoms that may need to be treated separately.\nThese include:\n\ndepression and anxiety \u2013 this can be treated with self care measures such as exercise, psychological therapy or medication; read more about\u00a0treating depression\nproblems sleeping (insomnia) \u2013 this can be improved by making changes to your normal bedtime routine; read more about treating insomnia\nerectile dysfunction \u2013 this can be treated with medication; read more about treating erectile dysfunction\nexcessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) \u2013 this can be reduced using a prescription antiperspirant,\u00a0or surgery in severe cases; read more about treating hyperhidrosis\nswallowing difficulties (dysphagia) \u2013\u00a0this can be improved by eating softened food, or by using a feeding tube in more severe cases; read more about treating dysphagia\nexcessive drooling \u2013 this can be improved with swallowing exercises, or surgery or medication in severe cases\nurinary incontinence \u2013 this can be treated with exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, medication, or surgery in severe cases; read more about treating urinary incontinence\ndementia \u2013\u00a0this can be treated with cognitive therapies and medication in some cases; read more about treating dementia\n\nClinical trials\nMuch progress has been made in the treatment of Parkinson's disease\u00a0as the result of\u00a0clinical trials,\u00a0where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.\nAll clinical trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they are worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials sometimes do better overall than those in routine care.\nIf you are asked if you want to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet about the trial.\nIf you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse to take part or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nComplementary and alternative therapies\nSome people with Parkinson's disease find\u00a0complementary therapies help them feel better. Many complementary treatments and therapies claim to ease the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nHowever, there's no clinical evidence they're effective in controlling the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nMost people think complementary treatments have no harmful effects. However, some can be harmful and they shouldn't be used instead of the medicines prescribed by your doctor.\nSome types of herbal remedies, such as St John's wort, can interact unpredictably if taken with some types of medication used to treat Parkinson's disease.\nIf you're considering using an alternative treatment along with your prescribed medicines, check with your care team first.\n\n\nIt's important to do what you can to stay physically and mentally healthy if you have Parkinson's disease.\nExercise and healthy eating\nRegular exercise is particularly important in helping relieve muscle stiffness, improving your mood, and relieving stress.\nThere are many activities you can do to help keep yourself fit, ranging from more active sports like tennis and cycling, to less strenuous activities such as walking, gardening and yoga.\nYou should also try to eat a balanced diet containing all the food groups to give your body the nutrition it needs to stay healthy.\nVaccinations\nEveryone with a long-term condition is encouraged to get a yearly flu jab each autumn.\nThe pneumococcal vaccination\u00a0is also usually recommended, which is a one-off injection that protects against a serious chest infection called pneumococcal pneumonia.\nRelationships and support\nBeing diagnosed with a long-term condition\u00a0like Parkinson's disease can put a strain on you, your family and friends. It can be difficult to talk to people about your condition, even if they're close to you.\nDealing with the deterioration of symptoms, such as increasing difficulty with movement, may make you feel frustrated and depressed. Spouses, partners or carers will inevitably feel anxious or frustrated as well.\nBe open about how you feel, and let your family and friends know what they can do to help. Don't feel shy about telling them you need some time to yourself, if that's what you want.\nSupport\nIf you have any questions about your condition, your GP or Parkinson's disease specialist nurse may be able to help.\nYou may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or someone at a specialist helpline. Your GP surgery will have details of these.\nSome people find it helpful to talk to others with Parkinson's disease, either at a local support group or in an internet chat room.\nCare and support services\nIt's worth taking time to think about your specific needs and what would help you achieve the best quality of life.\nFor example, you may wish to consider equipment, help in your home,\u00a0and home adaptations.\nParkinson's UK\nParkinson's UK is the main Parkinson's support and research charity in the UK.\nThey can offer the\u00a0support and advice you may need if you're living with Parkinson's disease, and can let you know about support groups in your local area.\nThey can be\u00a0contacted by:\n\nfree confidential helpline on 0808 800 0303 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm, and 10am to 2pm on Saturdays)\nemail:\u00a0hello@parkinsons.org.uk\n\nThe Parkinson's UK\u00a0website also features all the latest news, publications and research updates, as well as an online community where you can share your experiences of living with Parkinson's.\nWork and finances\nBeing diagnosed with Parkinson's doesn't mean you have to stop working. Many people with the condition keep working for years after their diagnosis.\nYou may find it hard to cope financially if you do have to stop work or work part-time because of your condition.\nHowever, you may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:\n\nYou are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from your employer if you have a job but can't work because of your illness.\nYou may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)\u00a0if you don't have a job and can't work because of your illness.\nYou may be eligible for Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which replaced the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), if you're aged 64 and under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties.\nYou may be able to get Attendance Allowance\u00a0if you're aged 65 or over.\nYou may be entitled to Carer's Allowance\u00a0if you're caring for someone with Parkinson's disease.\nYou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.\n\nDriving\nIf you've been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, you must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and your insurance company.\nYou won't necessarily have to stop driving. You'll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition, as well as details of your doctors and specialists. The DVLA will use this to decide whether you're fit to drive.\nComplex Parkinson's disease and palliative care\nComplex\u00a0Parkinson's disease is defined as the stage when treatment is unable to consistently control symptoms, or the person has developed\u00a0uncontrollable jerky movements (disabling dyskinesia).\nThese problems can still be helped by adjustment or addition of some of the medications used to treat Parkinson's disease,\u00a0under the\u00a0supervision\u00a0of a doctor with a specialist interest in Parkinson's disease.\nAs Parkinson's disease progresses, you'll be invited to discuss the care you want\u00a0with your healthcare team as you near the end of your life. This is known as palliative care.\nWhen there's no cure for an illness, palliative care tries to alleviate symptoms, and is also aimed at making the end of a person's life as comfortable as possible.\nThis is done by attempting to relieve pain and other distressing symptoms, while providing psychological, social and spiritual support for you and your family.\nPalliative care can be provided at home or\u00a0in a hospice, residential home or hospital. You may want to consider talking to your family and care team in advance about where you'd like to be treated and what care you wish to receive.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Pelvic organ prolapse is bulging of one or more of the pelvic organs into the vagina.\nThese organs are the uterus, vagina, bowel and bladder.\nSymptoms may include:\n\na sensation of a bulge or something coming down or out of the vagina, which sometimes needs to be pushed back\ndiscomfort during sex\nproblems passing urine \u2013 such as slow stream, a feeling of not emptying the bladder fully, needing to urinate more often and leaking a small amount of urine when you cough, sneeze or exercise (stress incontinence)\n\nSome women with a pelvic organ prolapse don't have any symptoms and the condition is only discovered during an internal examination for another reason, such as a cervical screening.\nWhen to see your GP\nPelvic organ prolapse isn't life-threatening, but it can affect your quality of life.\nSee your GP if you have any of the symptoms of a prolapse, or if you notice a lump in or around your vagina.\nYour doctor will need to carry out an internal pelvic examination. They'll ask you to undress from the waist down and lie back on the examination bed, while they feel for any lumps in your pelvic area.\nSome women may put off going to their GP if they're embarrassed or worried about what the doctor may find. However, the examination is important, only takes a few minutes and is similar to having a smear test.\nIf you have bladder symptoms, such as needing to rush to the toilet or leaking when you cough and sneeze, further tests may need to be carried out in hospital.\nFor example, a small tube (catheter) may be inserted into your bladder to examine your bladder function and identify any leakage problems. This test is known as urodynamics.\nYour doctor will decide if further tests are needed before treating the prolapse.\nTypes of prolapse\nIf pelvic organ prolapse is confirmed, it will usually be staged to indicate how severe it is. Most often, a number system is used, ranging from one to four, with four indicating a severe prolapse.\nPelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of the vagina. The main types of prolapse are:\n\nanterior prolapse (cystocele) \u2013 where the bladder bulges into the front wall of the vagina\nprolapse of the uterus and cervix or top of the vagina \u2013 which can be the result of previous treatment to remove the womb (hysterectomy)\nposterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele) \u2013 when the bowel bulges forward into the back wall of the vagina\n\nIt's possible to have more than one of these types of prolapse at the same time.\nWhy does prolapse happen?\nProlapse is caused by weakening of tissues that support the pelvic organs. Although there's rarely a single cause, the risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse can be increased by:\n\nyour age \u2013 prolapse is more common as you get older\nchildbirth, particularly if you had a long or difficult labour, or gave birth to multiple babies or a large baby \u2013 up to half of all women who have had children are affected by some degree of prolapse\nchanges caused by the menopause \u2013 such as weakening of tissue and low levels of the hormone oestrogen\nbeing overweight, obese or having large fibroids (non-cancerous tumours in or around the womb) or pelvic cysts \u2013 which creates extra pressure in the pelvic area\nprevious pelvic surgery \u2013 such as a hysterectomy or bladder repair\nrepeated heavy lifting and manual work\nlong-term coughing or sneezing \u2013 for example, if you smoke, have a lung condition or allergy\nexcessive straining when going to the toilet because of long-term constipation\n\nCertain conditions can also cause the tissues in your body to become weak, making a prolapse more likely, including:\n\njoint hypermobility syndrome \u2013 where your joints are very loose\nMarfan syndrome \u2013 an inherited condition that affects the blood vessels, eyes and skeleton\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome \u2013 a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body\n\nCan a prolapse be prevented?\nThere are several things you can do to reduce your risk of prolapse, including:\n\ndoing regular pelvic floor exercises\nmaintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you're overweight\neating a high-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain bread and cereal to avoid constipation and straining when going to the toilet\navoiding heavy lifting\n\nIf you smoke, stopping smoking may also help to reduce your risk of a prolapse.\nHow is prolapse treated?\nMany women with prolapse don't need treatment, as the problem doesn't seriously interfere with their normal activities.\nLifestyle changes such as weight loss and pelvic floor exercises are usually recommended in mild cases.\nIf the symptoms require treatment, a prolapse may be treated effectively using a device inserted into the vagina, called a vaginal pessary. This helps to hold the prolapsed organ in place.\nSurgery may also be an option for some women. This usually involves giving support to the prolapsed organ. In some cases, complete removal of the womb (hysterectomy) is required, especially if the womb has prolapsed out.\nMost women experience a better quality of life after surgery, but there's a risk of problems remaining or even getting worse.\n\n\nThere are several treatment options available for a pelvic organ prolapse, depending on your circumstances.\nThe treatment most suitable for you depends on:\n\nthe severity of your symptoms\nthe severity of the prolapse\nyour age and health\nwhether you're planning to have children in the future\n\nYou may not need any treatment if your prolapse is mild to moderate and not causing any pain or discomfort.\nThe various treatments for pelvic organ prolapse are outlined below.\nSelf care advice\nIf your prolapse is mild, there are some steps you can take that may help improve it or reduce the risk of it getting worse.\nThis may include:\n\ndoing regular pelvic floor exercises (see below)\nlosing weight if you're overweight, or maintaining a healthy weight for your build (you can check your body mass index (BMI) using the BMI chart)\neating a high-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and wholegrain bread and cereal to avoid constipation and straining when going to the toilet\navoiding heavy lifting and standing up for long periods of time\n\nIf you smoke, giving up will help, because coughing can make a prolapse worse. Read guidance on stopping smoking for more information.\nThe pelvic floor muscles are a group of muscles that wrap around the underside of the bladder and rectum.\nHaving weak or damaged pelvic floor muscles can make a prolapse more likely. Recent evidence suggests that pelvic floor exercises may help to improve a mild prolapse or reduce the risk of it getting worse.\nPelvic floor exercises are also used to treat urinary incontinence (when you leak urine), so may be useful if this is one of your symptoms.\nRead more about treating urinary incontinence\nTo help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, sit comfortably on a chair with your knees slightly apart. Squeeze the muscles eight times in a row and perform these contractions three times a day. Don't hold your breath or tighten your stomach, buttock, or thigh muscles at the same time.\nWhen you get used to doing this, you can try holding each squeeze for a few seconds (up to 10 seconds). Every week, you can add more squeezes, but be careful not to overdo it and always have a rest inbetween sets of squeezes.\nYour doctor may refer you to a specialist\u00a0physiotherapist, who can assess your pelvic floor and teach you how to do pelvic floor exercises. It usually takes at least three months before you notice any improvement.\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT)\nWhile there's little evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can directly treat pelvic organ prolapse, it can relieve some of the symptoms associated with prolapse, such as vaginal dryness or discomfort during sex.\nHRT increases the level of oestrogen in women who have been through the menopause.\nHRT medication is available as:\n\na cream you apply to your vagina\na tablet you insert into your vagina\na patch you stick on your skin\nan implant inserted under your skin\n\nHRT is used for women with prolapse after menopause who have the symptoms described above. Creams, tablets or pessaries may be used for a short time to improve these symptoms.\nVaginal pessaries\nA vaginal ring pessary is a device inserted into the vagina to hold the prolapse back. It works by holding the vaginal walls in place. Ring pessaries are usually made of latex (rubber) or silicone and come in different shapes and sizes.\nRing pessaries may be an option if your prolapse is more severe, but you would prefer not to have surgery. A gynaecologist (a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system) or a specialist nurse usually fits a pessary.\nThe pessary may need to be removed and replaced every four to six months.\nRing pessaries can occasionally cause vaginal discharge, some irritation and possibly bleeding and sores inside your vagina. Other side effects include:\n\npassing a small amount of urine when you cough, sneeze or exercise (stress incontinence)\ndifficulty with bowel movements\ninterference with having sex, although most women can have intercourse without any problems\nan imbalance of the usual bacteria found in your vagina (bacterial vaginosis)\n\nThese side effects can usually be treated.\nSurgery\nSurgery may be an option for treating a prolapse if it's felt the possible benefits outweigh the risks.\nSurgery for pelvic organ prolapse is relatively common. It's estimated that 1 in 10 women will have surgery for prolapse by the time they're 80 years old.\nThese procedures are outlined below.\nOne of the main surgical treatments for pelvic organ prolapse involves improving support for the pelvic organs.\nThis may involve stitching prolapsed organs back into place and supporting the existing tissues to make them stronger.\nPelvic organ repair may be done through cuts (incisions) in the vagina. It's usually carried out under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep during the operation and won't feel any pain.\nIf you're planning to have children and have a prolapse, your doctors may suggest delaying surgery until you're sure you no longer want to have any more children. This is because pregnancy can cause the prolapse to recur.\nIf the womb (uterus) is prolapsed, then removing it during an operation called a hysterectomy often helps the surgeon to give better support to the rest of the vagina and reduce the chance of a prolapse returning.\nA hysterectomy will usually only be considered in women who don't wish to have any more children, as you can't get pregnant after having a hysterectomy.\nMethods to elevate and support the uterus without removing it do exist, but these need to be discussed with your doctor.\nComplications from surgery\nAll types of surgery carry some risks. Your surgeon will explain these in more detail, but possible complications could include:\n\nrisks associated with anaesthesia\nbleeding, which may require a blood transfusion\ndamage to the surrounding organs, such as your bladder or bowel\nan infection \u2013 you may be given antibiotics to take during and after surgery to reduce the risk of infection\npain during sex, usually caused by narrowing of the vagina\nvaginal discharge and bleeding\nexperiencing more prolapse symptoms, which may require further surgery\na blood clot forming in one of your veins (for example, in your leg) \u2013 you may be given medication to help reduce this risk after surgery (see deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for more information)\n\nRecovering from surgery\nMost prolapse operations require an overnight stay in hospital. More major operations, such as a hysterectomy, may require a few nights in hospital.\nIf you need to stay in hospital, you may have a drip in your arm to provide fluids and a thin plastic tube called a catheter to drain urine from your bladder. Some gauze may be placed inside your vagina to act as a bandage for the first 24 hours. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Your stitches will usually dissolve on their own after a few weeks.\nFor the first few days or weeks after your operation, you may have some vaginal bleeding similar to a period. You may also have some vaginal discharge. This may last three or four weeks. During this time, you should use sanitary towels rather than tampons.\nEnhanced recovery is an NHS initiative to improve patient outcomes after surgery and speed up recovery.\nThis involves careful planning and preparation before surgery, as well as reducing the stress of surgery, by:\n\nusing pain relief to minimise pain\navoiding unnecessary drips, tubes and drains\nenabling you to eat and drink straight after your operation\nencouraging early mobilisation\n\nEven with enhanced recovery, there may still be some activities you need to avoid while you recover from surgery. Your care team can advise about activities you may need to avoid, such as heavy lifting and strenuous exercise, and for how long.\nGenerally, most people are advised to move around as soon as possible, with good rests every few hours.\nYou can usually shower and bathe as normal after leaving hospital, but you may need to avoid swimming for a few weeks.\nIt's best to avoid having sex for around four to six weeks, until you've healed completely.\nYour care team will advise about when you can return to work.\nProblems with recovery\nContact your GP if you experience:\n\na high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over\nsevere pain low in your tummy\nheavy vaginal bleeding\na stinging or burning sensation when you pass urine\nabnormal vaginal discharge, as this may be an infection\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Peripheral neuropathy develops when nerves in the body's extremities \u2013 such as the hands, feet and arms \u2013 are damaged. The symptoms depend on which nerves are affected.\nIn the UK, it's estimated that almost\u00a01 in 10 people\u00a0aged 55 or over are affected by some degree of peripheral neuropathy.\nThe peripheral nervous system\nThe\u00a0peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie\u00a0outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord).\nIt includes different types of nerves with their own specific functions, including:\n\nsensory nerves \u2013 responsible for transmitting sensations, such as pain and touch\nmotor nerves \u2013 responsible for controlling muscles\nautonomic nerves \u2013 responsible for regulating automatic functions of the body, such as blood pressure and bladder function\n\nSymptoms of peripheral neuropathy\nThe main symptoms can include:\n\nnumbness and tingling in the feet or hands\nburning, stabbing or shooting pain in affected areas\nloss of balance and co-ordination\nmuscle weakness, especially in the feet\n\nThese symptoms are usually constant, but may come and go.\nRead more about symptoms of peripheral neuropathy\nWhen to see your GP\nIt's recommended that people at highest risk\u00a0of peripheral neuropathy, such as people with\u00a0diabetes, have regular check-ups.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and may arrange some tests\u00a0to help identify the underlying cause. You may be referred to a hospital to see a neurologist\u00a0(a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system).\nGenerally, the sooner peripheral neuropathy is diagnosed, the better the chance of limiting the damage and preventing further complications.\nRead more about diagnosing peripheral neuropathy\nCauses of peripheral neuropathy\nIn the UK,\u00a0diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy.\nOver time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves. This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy.\nPeripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes. For example, it can be caused by:\n\nphysical injury to the nerves\na\u00a0viral infection such as\u00a0shingles\na side effect of certain medications or\u00a0drinking too much\u00a0alcohol\n\nPeople who are known to be at an\u00a0increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of peripheral neuropathy\nTreating\u00a0peripheral neuropathy\nTreatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause.\nOnly some of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated. For example, if you have diabetes it may help to gain better control\u00a0of your\u00a0blood sugar level, stop smoking, and cut down on alcohol.\nNerve pain may be treated with prescribed medications called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers are often ineffective.\nIf you have other symptoms, these may need to be treated individually. For example, treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy\u00a0and the use of walking aids.\nRead more about treating peripheral neuropathy.\nComplications of peripheral neuropathy\nThe outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged.\nSome cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas\u00a0in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time.\nIf the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy isn't treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected. This can lead to gangrene (tissue death) if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the affected foot has to be amputated.\nPeripheral neuropathy may\u00a0affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy). You may need treatment to increase your blood pressure or,\u00a0in rare cases, a\u00a0pacemaker.\nRead more about complications of peripheral neuropathy\n\n\nSymptoms vary according to the type of peripheral neuropathy and may develop quickly or slowly.\nThe main types of peripheral neuropathy include:\n\nsensory neuropathy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0damage to the nerves that carry messages of touch, temperature, pain and other sensations to the brain\nmotor neuropathy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0damage to the nerves that control movement\nautonomic neuropathy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0damage to\u00a0the nerves that control involuntary bodily processes, such as digestion, bladder function and control of blood pressure\nmononeuropathy\u00a0\u2013 damage to a single nerve outside of the central nervous system\n\nIn many cases, someone with peripheral neuropathy may have more than one of these types at the same time.\nA\u00a0combination of sensory and motor neuropathy is particularly common (sensorimotor polyneuropathy).\nThe symptoms of the main types of peripheral neuropathy are described below.\nSensory neuropathy\nSymptoms of sensory neuropathy can include:\n\nprickling and tingling sensation in the affected body part\u00a0pins and needles\nnumbness and less of an ability to feel pain or changes in temperature, particularly in your feet\na burning or sharp pain, usually in the feet\nfeeling pain from something that should not be painful at all, such as a very light touch (allodynia)\nloss of balance or co-ordination caused by less ability to tell the position of the feet or hands (sensory ataxia)\n\nMotor neuropathy\nSymptoms of motor neuropathy can include:\n\ntwitching and muscle cramps\nmuscle weakness or\u00a0paralysis affecting one or more muscles\nthinning (wasting) of muscles\nfoot drop\u00a0\u2013 difficulty lifting up the front part of your foot and toes, particularly noticeable when walking\n\nAutonomic neuropathy\nDamage to the autonomic nerves can result in a wide range of symptoms depending on where in the body the damage occurs.\nSymptoms of autonomic neuropathy can\u00a0include:\n\nconstipation or\u00a0diarrhoea, particularly at night\nfeeling sick, bloating and belching\nlow blood pressure (postural or orthostatic hypotension), which can make you feel faint or dizzy when standing up\nrapid heartbeat (tachycardia)\u00a0\nexcessive sweating or a lack of sweating\nproblems with sexual function, such as\u00a0erectile dysfunction in men\ndifficulty fully emptying your bladder of urine\u00a0\nbowel incontinence (loss of bowel control)\n\nMononeuropathy\nDepending on the specific nerve affected, symptoms of mononeuropathy can include:\n\naltered sensation or weakness in the fingers\ndouble vision or other problems with focusing your eyes, sometimes with eye pain\nweakness of one side of your face\u00a0Bell's palsy\nfoot or shin pain, weakness or altered sensation\n\nThe most common type of mononeuropathy is\u00a0carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The carpal tunnel is a small tunnel in your wrist.\nIn CTS, the median nerve becomes compressed where it passes through this tunnel, which may cause tingling, pain or numbness in the fingers.\n\n\nDiabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in the UK.\nNeuropathy can also be caused by other health conditions and\u00a0certain medications. In some cases, no cause\u00a0can be\u00a0identified\u00a0and this is termed idiopathic neuropathy.\nDiabetes\nPeripheral neuropathy\u00a0caused by\u00a0either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes\u00a0is called diabetic polyneuropathy.\u00a0It's probably caused by high levels of glucose in your blood damaging the tiny blood vessels that supply your nerves.\nPeripheral neuropathy becomes more likely the longer you've had diabetes. Up to\u00a01 in every\u00a04 people with the condition experience some pain caused by nerve damage.\nIf you have diabetes, your risk of polyneuropathy is higher if your blood sugar is poorly controlled or you:\n\nsmoke\nregularly consume large amounts of alcohol\nare over 40 years old\n\nIf you have diabetes, you should examine your own feet regularly to check for ulcers (open wounds or sores) or chilblains.\nOther causes\nAs well as diabetes, there are many other possible causes of peripheral neuropathy.\nSome of the health conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include:\n\nexcessive alcohol drinking for years\nlow levels of vitamin B12 or other vitamins\nphysical damage to the nerves\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as from an injury or during surgery\nan underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\ncertain infections\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as shingles, Lyme disease, diphtheria, botulism and HIV\ninflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis)\nchronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease\nmonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)\u00a0\u2013 the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood\ncertain types of cancer, such as lymphoma (a cancer of the lymphatic system) and multiple myeloma (a type of bone marrow cancer)\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease\u00a0and other types of hereditary motor sensory neuropathy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0genetic conditions that cause nerve damage, particularly in the feet\nhaving high levels of toxins in your body, such as arsenic, lead or mercury\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a rare condition that causes rapid onset of paralysis within days\namyloidosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a group of rare but serious conditions caused by deposits of abnormal protein called amyloid in tissues and organs throughout the body\nconditions caused by overactivity of the immune system\u00a0\u2013 such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or Sjogren's syndrome\n\nA few medications may sometimes cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect in some people. These include:\n\nsome types of\u00a0chemotherapy for cancer\u00a0\u2013 especially for bowel cancer, lymphoma or myeloma\nsome antibiotics, if taken for months\u00a0\u2013 such as metronidazole or\u00a0nitrofurantoin\nphenytoin\u00a0\u2013 used to treat\u00a0epilepsy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0if taken for\u00a0a long time\u00a0\namiodarone and thalidomide\n\n\n\nA number of tests may be used to diagnose peripheral neuropathy and its underlying cause.\nWhen you see your GP,\u00a0they'll\u00a0ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area of your body. This may involve testing sensation, strength and reflexes.\nYour doctor may\u00a0also arrange blood tests, especially to check for\u00a0causes such as diabetes\u00a0or vitamin B12 deficiency.\nConfirming if you have a neuropathy\nSome people may need to see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system)\u00a0in hospital for further tests such as:\n\na nerve conduction test (NCS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where\u00a0small metal wires called electrodes are placed on your skin which release tiny electric shocks that stimulate your nerves; the speed and strength of the nerve signal is measured\nelectromyography\u00a0(EMG)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a small needle is inserted through your skin into your muscle and used to measure the electrical activity of your muscles\n\nNCS and EMG\u00a0are usually carried out at the same time.\nIdentifying the cause of a neuropathy\u00a0\nYour GP can usually identify the underlying cause of a peripheral neuropathy.\nIf diabetes is suspected, they can usually make a confident diagnosis based on\u00a0your symptoms, a physical examination and checking the levels of glucose in your blood and urine.\nIf you're taking a medication known to cause peripheral neuropathy, your GP may\u00a0temporarily stop or reduce your dose to see whether your symptoms improve.\nIf the cause is uncertain, you may be referred to a neurologist for more extensive blood tests to check:\n\nwhether you have a rare acquired cause that may be responsible\nwhether you have a genetic abnormality, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease\n\nYou may need a\u00a0lumbar puncture to test the cerebrospinal fluid (a clear, colourless fluid that surrounds and supports the brain and spinal cord) for inflammation.\nFurther tests\nOccasionally, a nerve\u00a0biopsy may be carried out as part of your diagnosis. This is a minor surgical procedure where a small sample of a peripheral nerve is removed from near your ankle so it can be examined under a microscope.\nIt's then checked for changes\u00a0that could be a sign of certain types of peripheral neuropathy. However, nerve biopsies are rarely needed.\nYou may also need\u00a0a scan to look for any underlying cause of your neuropathy, such as:\n\nan\u00a0X-ray\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n\n\n\nTreatment for peripheral neuropathy\u00a0may include\u00a0treating any underlying cause or any symptoms you're experiencing.\nTreatment may be more successful\u00a0for certain underlying causes.\u00a0For example,\u00a0ensuring\u00a0diabetes\u00a0is well controlled may help improve neuropathy or at least stop it getting worse.\nTreating the underlying cause\nThere are many different possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, some of which can be treated in different ways. For example:\n\ndiabetes can sometimes be controlled by lifestyle changes, such as stopping smoking, cutting down\u00a0on alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly\nvitamin B12 deficiency can be treated with B12 injections or tablets\nperipheral neuropathy caused by a medication you're taking may improve if the medication is stopped\n\nSome less common types of peripheral neuropathy may be treated with medication, such as:\n\ncorticosteroids\u00a0\u2013 powerful anti-inflammatory medication\nimmunosuppressants\u00a0\u2013 medications that reduce the activity of the immune system\ninjections of immunoglobulin\u00a0\u2013 mixture of blood proteins called antibodies made by the immune system\n\nHowever, the underlying cause may not always be untreatable.\nRelieving nerve pain\nYou may also require medication to treat any nerve pain (neuropathic pain)\u00a0you're experiencing.\nUnlike most other types of pain, neuropathic pain doesn't usually get better with common painkillers, such as paracetamol and\u00a0ibuprofen\u00a0and other medications are\u00a0often used.\nThese should usually be started at the minimum dose, with the dose gradually increased until you notice an effect, because\u00a0the ideal dose for each person is unpredictable. Higher doses may be\u00a0better at managing the pain, but are also more likely to cause side effects.\nThe most common side effects are tiredness, dizziness or feeling \"drunk\". If you get these, it may be necessary to reduce your dose. Don't drive or operate machinery\u00a0if you experience drowsiness or blurred vision. You also may become more sensitive to the effects of alcohol.\nThe side effects should improve after a week or two as your body gets used to the medication. However, if your side effects continue, tell your GP\u00a0as it may be possible to change to a different medication that suits you better.\nEven if the first medication tried doesn't help, others may.\nMany of these medications may also be used for treating other conditions, such as depression, epilepsy, anxiety or headaches. If you're given an antidepressant, this may treat pain even if you're not depressed.\u00a0This doesn't mean your doctor suspects you're depressed.\nThe main medications recommended for neuropathic pain include:\n\namitriptyline\u00a0\u2013 also used for treatment of\u00a0headaches and\u00a0depression\nduloxetine\u00a0\u2013\u00a0also used for treatment of bladder problems and depression\npregabalin and gabapentin\u00a0\u2013 also used\u00a0to treat epilepsy, headaches or\u00a0anxiety\n\nThere are also some additional medications that can be used to relieve pain in a specific area of the body or to relieve particularly severe pain for short periods. These are described below.\nIf your pain is confined to a particular area of your body and you can't, or would prefer not to,\u00a0take the medications above, you may benefit from using capsaicin cream.\nCapsaicin is the substance that makes chilli peppers hot and is thought to work in neuropathic pain by stopping the nerves sending pain messages to the brain.\nA pea-sized amount of capsaicin cream is rubbed on the painful area of skin three or four times a day.\nSide effects of capsaicin cream can include skin irritation and a burning sensation in the treated area when you first start treatment.\nDon't use capsaicin cream on broken or inflamed skin and always wash your hands after applying it.\nThis is a large sticking plaster that contains a local anaesthetic. It's useful when pain affects only a small area of skin. It's stuck over the area of painful skin and the local anaesthetic is absorbed into the skin that's covered.\nTramadol is a powerful painkiller related to morphine that can be used to treat neuropathic pain that doesn't respond to other treatments your GP can prescribe.\nLike all opioids, tramadol can be addictive if it's taken for a long time. It will usually only be prescribed for a short time.\u00a0Tramadol can be useful to take at times when your pain is worse.\nCommon side effects of tramadol include:\n\nfeeling sick or\u00a0vomiting\ndizziness\nconstipation\n\nTreating other symptoms\nIn addition to treating pain, you may also require treatment to help you manage other symptoms you're experiencing as a result of peripheral neuropathy.\nFor example, if you have muscle weakness, you may need physiotherapy\u00a0to learn exercises to improve your muscle strength. You may also need to wear splints to support weak ankles or use walking aids to help you get around.\nOther problems associated with peripheral neuropathy\u00a0may be treatable with medication, such as:\n\nerectile dysfunction\nconstipation\nthe slow movement of food through your stomach (gastroparesis)\n\nIn some cases, you may need more invasive treatment, such as botulinum toxin injections for hyperhidrosis\u00a0or urinary catheterisation if you have problems emptying your bladder.\n\n\nPeripheral neuropathy can sometimes cause other medical problems, such as foot ulcers and heart rhythm changes, and blood circulation problems.\nThese complications vary depending on the underlying cause of the condition.\nDiabetic foot ulcer\nA diabetic foot ulcer is an open wound or sore on the skin\u00a0that's slow to heal. These are common in people with diabetic polyneuropathy.\nIf you have numb feet, it's easy to cut your foot by stepping on something sharp.\nAn ulcer can also occur if you unknowingly develop a blister caused by\u00a0badly fitting shoes. If you don't feel any pain, you may continue walking without protecting the blister. If the cut or blister gets worse, it may develop into an ulcer.\nHigh blood sugar can damage your blood vessels, causing the blood supply to your feet to become restricted. A reduced blood supply to the skin on your feet means it receives a lower number of infection-fighting cells, which can mean wounds take longer to heal and can lead to gangrene.\nGangrene\nIf you do develop a wound infection in one of your feet as a result of peripheral neuropathy, there's a risk this could\u00a0lead to gangrene\u00a0(death of part of the skin or underlying tissues).\nIf gangrene does develop, you may need surgery to remove the damaged tissue (known as debridement) and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection. In severe cases your toe or foot may need to be amputated.\nIf you have diabetes, you should take extra care of your feet. Get your feet checked regularly by a podiatrist (a medical professional, also known as a chiropodist, who specialises in foot care).\nCardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN)\nCardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is another potentially serious problem that's common in people with diabetic polyneuropathy.\nCAN occurs when damage to the peripheral nerves disrupts the automatic functions that control your blood circulation and heartbeat.\nThe two main noticeable symptoms of CAN are:\n\nan inability to exercise for more than a very short period of time\northostatic hypotension \u2013 a type of low blood pressure that can make you feel dizzy or faint when you stand up\n\nYou may be able to control the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension by using a number of self care techniques, such as:\n\nstanding or sitting up slowly and gradually\ndrinking plenty of fluids to increase the volume of your blood and raise your blood pressure\nwearing compression stockings to help prevent blood falling back down into your legs\ntilting your bed by raising it at the head end\n\nIn some cases, medication may be required to treat orthostatic hypotension.\nTwo widely used medications are:\n\nfludrocortisone\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which works by increasing the volume of your blood\nmidodrine\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which works by tightening your blood vessels\n\nA more serious concern with CAN is that your heart may suddenly develop an abnormal pattern of beating (arrhythmia), which could lead to a cardiac arrest,\u00a0where your heart stops beating altogether.\nTo prevent this, you may be prescribed medication to help regulate the beating of your heart, such as flecainide,\u00a0beta-blockers or amiodarone.\nIf you have CAN, you'll probably need to have regular check-ups so your heart function can be monitored.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Pleurisy is inflammation of the sheet-like layers that cover the lungs (the pleura).\nThe most common symptom of pleurisy is a sharp\u00a0chest pain when breathing deeply. Sometimes the pain is also felt in the shoulder.\nThe pain may be worse when you cough, sneeze or move around, and it may be relieved by taking shallow breaths.\nOther symptoms can include\u00a0shortness of breath\u00a0and a dry cough.\nVisit your GP if you\u00a0experience the above symptoms.\u00a0Seek immediate medical help if your chest pain is severe, particularly if you also have other symptoms, such as coughing up blood, nausea or sweating.\nSeeing your GP\nPleurisy can usually be diagnosed by studying your symptoms. Your GP can listen to your chest to check for the distinctive dry, crunching sound that suggests you may have pleurisy.\nFurther tests may be\u00a0needed to identify the underlying cause of your pleurisy and to assess how severe it is. These can include:\n\nblood tests to determine whether you have an infection or an autoimmune condition\nchest X-rays\nan ultrasound scan\u00a0\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\na biopsy \u2013 a small sample of pleural or lung tissue is removed for further testing\n\nWhat causes pleurisy?\nMost cases are the result of a\u00a0viral infection (such as the\u00a0flu) or\u00a0a bacterial infection (such as pneumonia).\nIn rarer cases, pleurisy can be caused by conditions\u00a0such as\u00a0a blood clot blocking the flow of blood into the lungs (pulmonary embolism)\u00a0or lung cancer.\nPleurisy can affect people of all ages, but people of 65 years and over are most at risk, because they're more likely to develop a chest infection.\nRead more about the causes of pleurisy.\nHow is pleurisy treated?\nTreatment for pleurisy depends on the underlying cause.\nFor example, pleurisy caused by a viral infection will often resolve itself without treatment.\u00a0However, pleurisy caused by a bacterial infection is usually treated with antibiotics, and people who are frail or already in poor health may be admitted to hospital.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are often used to relieve the chest pain associated with pleurisy.\nIf excess fluid builds up between the pleural layers, it may be necessary to drain the fluid to prevent breathing difficulties.\nRead more about treating pleurisy.\n\n\nPleurisy is inflammation of the pleura. It's usually caused by another condition, such as an infection, but sometimes no cause can be identified.\nThe pleura are two thin sheets of tissue\u00a0that separate the lungs and ribcage. One is attached to the ribcage and the other is attached to the lungs.\nBetween the pleural sheets is a thin layer of liquid that lubricates the pleura, helping to reduce\u00a0friction when you breathe in and out.\nWhen there's inflammation, the surfaces of the two layers can become rough and the fluid can become sticky. This can cause the layers to rub together, resulting in pain and discomfort.\nInfection\nAn infection is the most common cause of pleurisy.\u00a0Any type of infection has the potential to spread to the pleura, but viral infections are usually responsible. Viruses known to\u00a0cause\u00a0pleurisy include:\n\nthe influenza (flu) virus\nthe Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which\u00a0causes\u00a0glandular fever\ncytomegalovirus (CMV) \u2013 a common virus found in most people, which doesn't usually cause any noticeable symptoms\nparainfluenza \u2013 the virus that causes the childhood condition croup\n\nIn some cases, pleurisy is caused by bacteria, such as:\n\nstreptococcal bacteria \u2013 often associated with pneumonia, throat infections and some types of skin infections, such as\u00a0impetigo and\u00a0cellulitis\nstaphylococcal bacteria \u2013 often associated with skin infections,\u00a0food poisoning and, more seriously, blood poisoning (sepsis)\n\nMeticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause pleurisy, especially in\u00a0hospital patients. MRSA is a type of bacteria\u00a0with a resistance to a number of commonly used antibiotics.\nOther causes\nOther possible causes of pleurisy include:\n\ninjury \u2013 if the ribs are bruised or fractured, the pleura can become inflamed\npulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot developing inside the lungs\nsickle cell anaemia \u2013 a blood disorder that usually affects\u00a0people of African or Caribbean descent\nchemotherapy\u00a0and\u00a0radiotherapy\nHIV or AIDS\nlung cancer\nmesothelioma \u2013 a type of cancer caused by inhaling asbestos\n\nAutoimmune conditions, such as\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, are other possible causes of pleurisy. In these conditions, something goes wrong with the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence against infection and illness)\u00a0and it begins to attack healthy tissue.\n\n\nTreatment for pleurisy usually involves relieving pain and treating the underlying cause of the condition.\nIf treated promptly, pleurisy\u00a0often resolves without any lasting damage to the lungs.\nTreating pain\nThe chest pain associated with pleurisy can be treated using\u00a0a type of painkiller known as\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most often, ibuprofen is used.\nIf NSAIDs are ineffective or unsuitable, you may be prescribed another painkiller, such as\u00a0paracetamol or codeine.\nIt may seem strange, but lying down on the side of your chest that hurts may also help\u00a0to reduce the pain.\nTreating the underlying cause\nIt may also be necessary to treat the underlying cause of your pleurisy.\nIf you have pleurisy\u00a0caused by a bacterial infection, you'll need a course of\u00a0antibiotics. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may be either\u00a0tablets or injections. Combinations of different antibiotics are sometimes used.\nHowever, if\u00a0your pleurisy is caused by a viral infection, further treatment may not be required,\u00a0as the infection usually resolves itself after a few days.\nIn cases where your symptoms are particularly severe or you're already in poor health, you may need to be admitted to hospital so\u00a0your body\u2019s functions can be supported until your condition stabilises.\nPleural effusion\nIn some cases, pleurisy causes a build-up of excess fluid around the lungs called pleural effusion.\nPleural effusion can\u00a0result in\u00a0shortness of breath that gets progressively worse. This\u00a0is more likely in cases of pleurisy caused by pulmonary embolism or a bacterial infection.\nIf pleural effusion doesn't clear up as your pleurisy is treated, or if you're very short of breath, a tube will need to be inserted so the fluid\u00a0can be drained away.\nThe tube\u00a0may\u00a0be inserted using\u00a0either general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) or local anaesthetic (the area where the tube is inserted is numbed).\nIf a lot of fluid has to be drained away,\u00a0you may need to stay in hospital for a few days.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It's usually caused by a bacterial infection.\nAt the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs\u00a0are clusters of tiny air sacs.

It's more widespread\u00a0in autumn and winter.\nPneumonia can affect people of any age, but it's more common\u00a0\u2013 and can be more serious\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly.\nPeople in these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment if they develop pneumonia.\nWhat causes pneumonia?\nPneumonia is usually the result of\u00a0a\u00a0pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae.\nMany different types of bacteria, including\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi.\nAs well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include:\n\nviral pneumonia \u2013 most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and sometimes influenza type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children\naspiration pneumonia \u2013 caused by breathing in vomit,\u00a0a foreign object, such as a peanut,\u00a0or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical\nfungal pneumonia \u2013\u00a0rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system\nhospital-acquired pneumonia \u2013 pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care\u00a0on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia\n\nThe following groups have an increased risk of developing pneumonia:\n\nbabies and very young children\nelderly people\npeople who smoke\npeople with other health conditions, such as\u00a0asthma, cystic fibrosis, or a heart, kidney or liver condition\npeople with a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 for example, as a result of a recent illness, such as flu, having\u00a0HIV or AIDS, having chemotherapy,\u00a0or taking medication following an organ transplant\n\nDiagnosing pneumonia\nYour GP may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest. Further tests may be needed in some cases.\nPneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many symptoms with other conditions, such as the common cold, bronchitis and asthma.\nTo help make a diagnosis, your GP may ask you:\n\nwhether\u00a0you feel breathless or you're breathing faster than usual\nhow long you've had your cough,\u00a0and whether you're coughing up mucus and what colour it is\nif the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or out\n\nYour GP may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds.\nThey may also listen to your chest by tapping it. Lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound\u00a0from normal healthy lungs.\nIf you have mild pneumonia, you probably won't\u00a0need to have a chest X-ray\u00a0or any other tests.\nYou may need a chest\u00a0X-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test or blood tests,\u00a0if your symptoms haven't improved within 48 hours of starting treatment.\nTreating pneumonia\nMild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by:\n\ngetting plenty of rest\ntaking antibiotics\ndrinking plenty of fluids\n\nIf you don't have any other health problems, you should respond well to treatment and soon recover, although your cough may last for some time.\nAs pneumonia isn't usually passed from one person to another, it's safe to be around others, including family members.\nHowever, people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better.\nFor at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital.\nThis is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person's health and age.\nRead more about\u00a0treating pneumonia.\nComplications of pneumonia\nComplications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly\u00a0and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes.\nPossible complications of pneumonia include:\n\npleurisy\u00a0\u2013 where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failure\na lung abscess\u00a0\u2013 a rare complication that's mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe alcohol misuse\nblood poisoning (septicaemia)\u00a0\u2013 also a rare but serious complication\n\nYou'll be admitted to hospital for treatment if you develop one of these complications.\nPreventing pneumonia\nAlthough most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren't passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading.\nFor example, you should:\n\ncover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneeze\u00a0\nthrow away used tissues immediately \u2013\u00a0germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouth\nwash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objects\n\nA healthy\u00a0lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. For example, you should avoid smoking\u00a0as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection.\nFind out\u00a0how to stop smoking.\nExcessive and prolonged\u00a0alcohol misuse also weakens your lungs' natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia.\nPeople at high risk of pneumonia\u00a0should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine\u00a0and flu vaccine.\n\n\nMild pneumonia can usually be treated at home with rest, antibiotics and by drinking plenty of fluids. More severe cases may need hospital treatment.\nUnless a healthcare professional tells you otherwise, you should always finish taking a prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better.\nIf you stop taking an antibiotic part way through a course, the bacteria can become resistant to the antibiotic.\nAfter starting treatment, your symptoms should steadily improve.\nHowever, how quickly they improve will depend on how severe your pneumonia is.\u00a0\nAs a general\u00a0guide, after:\n\none week \u2013 fever should have resolved\nfour weeks \u2013\u00a0chest pain and mucus production should have substantially reduced\nsix weeks \u2013 cough and breathlessness should have substantially reduced\nthree months \u2013 most symptoms should have resolved, but you may still feel very tired (fatigue)\nsix months \u2013 most people will feel back to normal\n\nTreatment at home\nVisit your GP if your symptoms don't improve within three days of starting antibiotics.\nSymptoms may not improve if:\n\nthe bacteria causing the infection is resistant to antibiotics \u2013 your GP may prescribe a different antibiotic, or they may prescribe a second antibiotic for you to take with the first one\na\u00a0virus is causing the infection, rather than bacteria \u2013 antibiotics have no effect on viruses, and\u00a0your body's immune system will have to fight the viral infection by creating antibodies\n\nPainkillers, such as\u00a0paracetamol or\u00a0ibuprofen, may help relieve\u00a0pain and reduce\u00a0fever.\nHowever, you shouldn't take ibuprofen if you:\n\nare allergic to aspirin or other\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nhave asthma, kidney disease, a history of\u00a0stomach ulcers or indigestion\n\nCough medicines aren't recommended as there's also little evidence they are effective. A warm honey and lemon drink can help relieve discomfort caused by coughing.\nYour\u00a0cough may persist for two to three weeks after you finish your course of\u00a0antibiotics,\u00a0and you may feel tired for even longer as your body continues to recover.\nDrink plenty of fluids to avoid\u00a0dehydration, and get plenty of rest to help your body recover.\nIf you smoke,\u00a0it's more important than ever to stop, as smoking damages your lungs.\nRead more about\u00a0stop smoking treatments and how to stop smoking.\nSee your GP if, after following the above self-help measures, your condition is deteriorating or isn't improving as expected.\nPneumonia isn't usually passed from one person to another, so it's safe to be around others, including family members.\nHowever, it's best for people with a weakened immune system to avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better.\nYour GP will probably arrange a follow-up appointment for you about six weeks after you start your course of antibiotics.\nIn some cases, they may arrange follow-up tests, such as a chest X-ray, if:\n\nyour symptoms haven't improved\nyour symptoms have come back\nyou smoke\nyou're over the age of 50\n\nSome people may be advised to have a flu vaccination or pneumococcal vaccination after recovering from pneumonia.\nRead more about preventing pneumonia.\nTreatment in hospital\nYou may\u00a0need treatment in\u00a0hospital if\u00a0your symptoms are severe.

These conditions will need to be ruled out before polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosed.\nRead more about the symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica\u00a0and diagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica.\nWhat causes polymyalgia rheumatica?\nThe cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors\u00a0is thought to be responsible.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica is relatively common in the UK. It's estimated that one in every 1,200 people develop the condition every year.\nPolymyalgia rheumatica is\u00a0age-related. Most people who are diagnosed with the condition are over 70. It's extremely rare in people younger than 50. It's also more common in women than men.\nTreating polymyalgia rheumatica\nThe main treatment for\u00a0polymyalgia rheumatica is a\u00a0coritcosteroid medication called prednisolone, which is used to help relieve the symptoms.\nYou'll\u00a0initially\u00a0be prescribed a high dose of prednisolone, which will be reduced gradually over time.\nMost people with polymyalgia rheumatica will need to take a long-term course of corticosteroid treatment\u00a0(lasting 18 months to two years) to prevent their symptoms returning.\nRead more about treating polymyalgia rheumatica.\n\n\nThe most common symptom of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is pain and stiffness in the shoulder muscles, which develops quickly over a few days or weeks.\nThe muscles in the neck and\u00a0hips are also often affected. Both sides of the body are usually affected.\nThe stiffness often feels\u00a0worse first thing in the morning after you wake up and starts to improve after about 45 minutes as you become more active.\nSome people with\u00a0polymyalgia rheumatica have additional symptoms, including:\n\na mild high temperature (fever) of 37-38C (98.6-100.4F)\ndepression\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you have symptoms of pain and stiffness that last longer than a week, you should make an appointment to see your GP so that the cause can be investigated.\nWhen to seek immediate medical advice\nYou should seek immediate medical advice if you have been diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica (or the condition is suspected) and you suddenly develop:\n\na persistent and severe\u00a0headache\njaw pain or cramping in your jaw muscles which is worse when you're eating\npain in the tongue when chewing\u00a0\nvision loss\u00a0or vision disturbances, such as\u00a0double vision\n\nThese symptoms may indicate a more serious condition called giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis).\nCall your GP immediately for advice\u00a0if you have any of the above symptoms. If this isn't possible,\u00a0contact your local out of hours service\u00a0or call the\u00a0NHS 24 '111' service.\n\n\nDiagnosing polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can often be quite a lengthy process that involves several different tests.\nThis is because the condition shares many symptoms with more common health conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which need to be ruled out first.\nTests\nThere's no specific test for polymyalgia rheumatica, but it's likely that a series of\u00a0blood tests\u00a0will be carried out.\nTwo blood tests \u2013 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) \u2013 can be used to check the levels of inflammation in your body.\nIf the ESR and CRP test results are normal, it\u2019s unlikely that polymyalgia rheumatica will be diagnosed because your doctor won\u2019t want to prescribe a long-term course of steroids if the diagnosis is uncertain. Sometimes, the ESR may be normal and CRP may be raised, which would be more likely to indicate a positive diagnosis. This is why both tests are usually carried out at the same time.\nAs inflammation is a characteristic of many conditions, high levels don't automatically mean that you have polymyalgia rheumatica. Further tests may be needed to help rule out other conditions that cause inflammation. For example, a test for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies, may be carried out to rule out rheumatoid arthritis.\nBlood tests can also help determine:\n\nwhether there's an infection in your blood\nhow well some of your organs, such as your kidneys, are working\nwhether you have an overactive thyroid gland or an underactive thyroid gland (both conditions can cause muscle pain)\n\nYou may also have a urine test to check how well your liver is functioning.\nX-rays and ultrasound scans may also be used to look at the condition of your bones and joints.\nSymptom checklist\nAfter other possible causes of your symptoms have been ruled out, a checklist can be used to see whether your symptoms match those most commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.\nA confident diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica can usually be made if you meet all of the following criteria:\n\nyou're over 50 years of age\u00a0\nyou have pain in your shoulders or your hips\nyou have stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes\nyour symptoms have lasted longer than two weeks\nblood tests show raised levels of inflammation in your body\nyour symptoms rapidly\u00a0improve after treatment with\u00a0corticosteroids\n\nRead more about treating polymyalgia rheumatica.\n\n\nSteroid medication (corticosteroids) is the preferred treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).\nA type of corticosteroid called\u00a0prednisolone is usually prescribed.\nPrednisolone\nPrednisolone works by blocking the effects of certain chemicals that cause inflammation inside your body. It doesn't cure polymyalgia rheumatica, but it can help\u00a0relieve the symptoms.\nWhen used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisolone is taken as a tablet. Most people will be prescribed several tablets to take once a day.\nYou'll be prescribed a high dose of prednisolone initially, and the dose will be gradually reduced every one to two months.\nAlthough your symptoms should improve within a few days of starting treatment, you'll probably\u00a0need to continue taking\u00a0a low dose of prednisolone for\u00a0about two years.\nIn many cases, polymyalgia rheumatica improves on its own after this time. However, there's a chance that the condition will return (relapse)\u00a0once treatment stops.\nDon't suddenly stop taking steroid medication unless a doctor in charge of your care tells you it's safe to do so. Suddenly stopping treatment with steroids can make you feel very ill.\nAbout\u00a0one in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state when they take the medication.\nYou may feel\u00a0depressed and\u00a0suicidal, anxious or confused. Some people also experience hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). Contact your GP as soon as possible if you experience changes to your mental state.\u00a0\nOther side effects of prednisolone include:\n\nincreased appetite that often leads to weight gain\nincreased blood pressure\nmood changes, such as becoming aggressive or\u00a0irritable with people\nweakening of the bones (osteoporosis)\nstomach ulcers\u00a0\nincreased risk of infection, particularly with the\u00a0varicella-zoster virus (the virus that causes\u00a0chickenpox and\u00a0shingles)\u00a0\n\nSeek immediate medical advice if you think you've been exposed to the varicella-zoster\u00a0virus, or if a member of your household develops chickenpox or shingles.\nThe risk of these side effects should improve as your dose of prednisolone is decreased.\nSee\u00a0side effects of corticosteroids for more information about how these side effects may affect you and how they're treated.\nOther medications\nSometimes, other medicines may be combined with corticosteroids to help prevent relapses or to allow your dose of prednisolone to be reduced.\nSome people are prescribed immunosuppressant medication, such as methotrexate. This is used to reduce or suppress the immune system (the body's defence against infection and illness). It may be helpful for people with polymyalgia rheumatica who have frequent relapses or don't respond to normal steroid treatment.\nYour doctor may recommend painkillers, such as paracetamol, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to help relieve pain and stiffness while your dose of prednisolone is reduced.\nFollow-up\nYour GP will ask you to attend regular follow-up appointments to check how well you're responding to treatment, whether your dose of prednisolone needs to be adjusted, and how well you're coping with the side effects of the medication.\nDuring these appointments, you'll have\u00a0blood tests to check the levels of inflammation inside your body.\nFollow-up appointments are usually recommended every few weeks for the first three months and then at three- to six-monthly intervals after this time.\nContact your GP if your symptoms return\u00a0during any part of your treatment. Your dosage may need to be adjusted.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events.\nSomeone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt.\nThey may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult.\nThese symptoms are often severe and\u00a0persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person\u2019s day-to-day life.\nRead more about the symptoms of PTSD.\nCauses of PTSD\nThe type of events that can cause PTSD include:\n\nserious road accidents\nviolent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery\nprolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect\nwitnessing violent deaths\nmilitary combat\nbeing held hostage\nterrorist attacks\nnatural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis\n\nPTSD\u00a0can develop immediately\u00a0after someone experiences a\u00a0disturbing event or it\u00a0can occur weeks, months or even years later.\nPTSD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3 people who have a traumatic experience, but it's not clear exactly why some people develop\u00a0the condition\u00a0and others don't.\nRead more about the causes of PTSD.\nComplex PTSD\nPeople who repeatedly experience traumatic situations such as severe neglect, abuse or violence may be diagnosed with complex PTSD.\nComplex PTSD can cause similar symptoms to PTSD and may not develop until years after the event.

However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear.\nSome people with PTSD experience long periods when their symptoms are less noticeable, followed by periods where they get worse. Other people have constant, severe symptoms.\nThe specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described below.\nRe-experiencing\nRe-experiencing is the most\u00a0typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event\u00a0in the form of:\n\nflashbacks\nnightmares\nrepetitive and distressing images or sensations\nphysical sensations \u2013 such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling\n\nSome\u00a0people have\u00a0constant negative thoughts about their experience, repeatedly asking themselves questions that prevent them from coming to terms with the event.\nFor example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame.\nAvoidance and emotional numbing\nTrying to avoid being\u00a0reminded of the traumatic event\u00a0is another\u00a0key symptom of PTSD. This usually\u00a0means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience.\nMany people with\u00a0PTSD try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies.\nSome people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. This is known as emotional numbing. This can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy.\nHyperarousal (feeling 'on edge')\nSomeone with\u00a0PTSD may be very\u00a0anxious and find it difficult to relax. They\u00a0may be constantly aware\u00a0of threats and easily startled.\u00a0This state of mind\u00a0is known as\u00a0hyperarousal.\nHyperarousal\u00a0often\u00a0leads to:\n\nirritability\nangry outbursts\nsleeping problems (insomnia)\ndifficulty concentrating\n\nOther problems\nMany people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including:\n\nother mental health problems \u2013 such as depression, anxiety\u00a0or phobias\nself-harming or destructive behaviour\u00a0\u2013 such as drug misuse\u00a0or alcohol misuse\nother physical symptoms \u2013 such as headaches, dizziness,\u00a0chest pains and\u00a0stomach aches\n\nPTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.\nPTSD in children\nPTSD\u00a0can affect children as well as adults. Children with\u00a0PTSD can have similar symptoms to adults, such as having trouble sleeping and upsetting nightmares.\nLike adults, children with PTSD may also lose interest in activities they used to enjoy and may have physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches.\nHowever, there are some symptoms that are more specific to children with PTSD, such as:\n\nbedwetting\nbeing\u00a0unusually anxious about being separated from\u00a0a parent or other adult\nre-enacting\u00a0the traumatic event(s) through their play\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIt's normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally\u00a0over a few weeks.\nYou should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after\u00a0the traumatic experience, or if\u00a0the symptoms are\u00a0particularly troublesome.\nYour GP will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. They'll ask whether you've experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you've re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares.\nYour GP can refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you'd benefit from treatment. See\u00a0treating PTSD for more information.\n\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or after a prolonged traumatic experience.\nTypes of events that can lead to PTSD include:\n\nserious road accidents\nviolent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery\nprolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect\nwitnessing violent deaths\nmilitary combat\nbeing held hostage\nterrorist attacks\nnatural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis\na diagnosis of a life-threatening condition\nan unexpected severe injury or death of a close family member\u00a0or friend\n\nPTSD\u00a0isn't usually related to\u00a0situations that are simply upsetting, such as divorce, job loss or failing exams.\nPTSD develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. It isn't fully understood why some people develop the condition while others don't. However, certain factors appear to make some people more likely to develop PTSD.\nIf you've had\u00a0depression or\u00a0anxiety in the past, or you don't receive much support from family or friends, you're more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event.\nThere may also be a genetic factor involved in PTSD. For example, having a parent with a mental health problem\u00a0is thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.\nPossible causes\nAlthough it's not clear exactly why people develop PTSD, a number of possible reasons have been suggested. These are described below.\nOne suggestion is that the symptoms of PTSD are the result of an instinctive\u00a0mechanism\u00a0intended to\u00a0help you survive further traumatic experiences.\nFor example, the flashbacks many people with PTSD experience may force you to think about the event in detail so you're better prepared if it happens again. The feeling of being \"on edge\" (hyperarousal) may develop to help you react quickly in another crisis.\nHowever, while\u00a0these responses may be intended to help you survive, they're actually very unhelpful in reality because you can't process and move on from\u00a0the traumatic experience.\nStudies have shown that people with PTSD have abnormal levels of stress hormones.\nNormally, when in danger,\u00a0the body produces stress hormones such as adrenaline to\u00a0trigger a reaction in the body. This reaction,\u00a0often known as the \"fight or flight\" reaction, helps to deaden the senses and dull pain.\nPeople with PTSD have been found to continue to produce high amounts of fight or flight hormones even when there's no danger. It's thought this may be responsible for the numbed emotions and hyperarousal experienced by some people with PTSD.\nIn people with PTSD, parts of the brain involved in emotional processing appear different in brain scans.\nOne part of the brain responsible for memory and emotions is known as the hippocampus. In people with PTSD, the hippocampus appears smaller in size. It's thought that\u00a0changes in this part of the brain may be related to fear and anxiety, memory problems and flashbacks.\nThe malfunctioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and nightmares from being properly processed, so the anxiety they generate doesn't reduce over time.\nTreatment of PTSD results in proper processing of the memories so, over time, the flashbacks and nightmares gradually disappear.\n\n\nThe main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychotherapy and medication.\nTraumatic\u00a0events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and seeking professional help is often the only way of effectively treating PTSD.\nIt's possible for PTSD to be\u00a0successfully treated many years after the traumatic event occurred, which means it's never too late to seek help.\nAssessment\nBefore having treatment for\u00a0PTSD, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs.\nYour GP will often carry out an initial assessment, but you'll be referred to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment\u00a0if\u00a0you've had symptoms of PTSD for more than four weeks or your symptoms are severe.\nThere are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have PTSD, such as:\n\na psychologist \u2013 an expert in how the mind works\na community psychiatric nurse \u2013 a nurse who specialises in mental healthcare\na psychiatrist \u2013 a mental health specialist who diagnoses and treats mental health conditions\n\nWatchful waiting\nIf you have mild symptoms of PTSD, or you've had symptoms for less than four weeks, an approach called watchful waiting may be recommended.\nWatchful waiting involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse. It's\u00a0sometimes recommended because 2 in every 3 people who\u00a0develop problems after a traumatic experience get better within a few weeks without treatment.\nIf watchful waiting is recommended, you should have a follow-up appointment within one month.\nPsychotherapy\nIf you have PTSD that requires treatment, psychotherapy\u00a0is usually recommended first. A combination of\u00a0psychotherapy and medication may be recommended\u00a0if you have severe or persistent PTSD.\nPsychotherapy\u00a0is a type of therapy often\u00a0used to\u00a0treat emotional problems and mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, anxiety\u00a0and obsessive compulsive disorder.\nThe treatment\u00a0is carried out by\u00a0trained mental health professionals who listen to you and help\u00a0you come up\u00a0with effective strategies to resolve your problems.\nThe main types of psychotherapy used to treat people with PTSD are described below.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think and act.\nTrauma-focused CBT uses a range of psychological treatment techniques to help you come to terms with the traumatic event.\nFor example, your therapist may ask you to confront your traumatic memories by thinking about your experience in detail. During this process your therapist helps you cope with any distress you\u00a0feel, while\u00a0identifying any unhelpful thoughts or misrepresentations you have about the experience.\nYour therapist can help you gain control of your fear and distress by changing the negative way you think about your experience. For example,\u00a0feeling\u00a0you're\u00a0to blame for what happened or fear that it may happen again.\nYou may also be encouraged to gradually restart any activities you've avoided since your experience, such as driving a car if you had an accident.\nYou'll usually have\u00a08-12 weekly sessions of trauma-focused CBT, although fewer may be needed. Sessions usually last for around 60-90 minutes.\nEye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a relatively new treatment which has been found to reduce the symptoms of PTSD.\nIt involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of your therapist's finger, while recalling the traumatic incident.\u00a0Other methods\u00a0may include\u00a0the therapist tapping their finger or playing a tone.\nIt's not clear exactly how EMDR works\u00a0but it may help you to change the negative way you think about a traumatic experience.\nYou may also be offered group therapy as some people find it helpful\u00a0to speak about their experiences with other people\u00a0who also have PTSD. Group therapy can be used to teach you ways to manage your symptoms and help you understand the condition.\nThere are also a number of charities\u00a0which provide\u00a0counselling and support groups for PTSD. For example:\n\nCombat Stress\u00a0\u2013 a military charity specialising in helping ex-servicemen and women\nRape Crisis\u00a0\u2013 a UK charity providing a range of services for women and girls who have experienced abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault\nVictim Support \u2013 providing support and information to victims or witnesses of crime\nCRUSE\u00a0\u2013 a UK charity providing support and information for people who have experienced bereavement\n\nMedication\nAntidepressants such as\u00a0paroxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, amitriptyline or phenelzine\u00a0are sometimes used to treat PTSD in adults.\nOf these medications, paroxetine and sertraline are the only ones licensed specifically for the treatment of PTSD. However, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and phenelzine have also been found to be effective and may be\u00a0recommended as well.\nHowever, these\u00a0medications will only be used if:\n\nyou choose not to have trauma-focused psychological treatment\npsychological treatment wouldn't be effective because there's an ongoing threat of further trauma (such as domestic violence)\nyou've gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment\nyou have an underlying medical condition, such as severe depression, that significantly affects your ability to benefit from psychological treatment\n\nAmitriptyline or phenelzine will usually only be used under the supervision of a mental health specialist.\nAntidepressants\u00a0can also be prescribed to reduce any associated symptoms of depression and anxiety and to help with sleeping problems. However,\u00a0they're not usually prescribed\u00a0for people younger than\u00a018 unless recommended by a specialist.\nIf medication for PTSD is effective, it's usually be continued for a minimum of 12 months before being gradually withdrawn over the course of four weeks or longer. If a medication\u00a0isn't effective at reducing your symptoms,\u00a0your dosage may be increased.\nBefore prescribing a medication, your doctor should inform you about possible side effects you may have while taking it, along with any possible withdrawal symptoms when the medication is withdrawn.\nFor example, common\u00a0side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea.\nPossible withdrawal symptoms associated with paroxetine include sleep disturbances, intense dreams, anxiety and irritability. Withdrawal symptoms are less likely if the medication is reduced slowly.\nFor\u00a0children and young people with PTSD, trauma-focused CBT is usually recommended.\nThis normally involves\u00a0a course of 8-12 sessions that have been adapted to suit the child\u2019s age, circumstances and level of development. Where appropriate, treatment includes consulting with and involving the child's\u00a0family.\nTreatment with medication isn't usually recommended for children and young people with PTSD.\n\n\nComplex PTSD may be diagnosed in adults or children who have repeatedly experienced traumatic events, such as violence, neglect or abuse.\nComplex PTSD is thought to be more severe if:\n\nthe traumatic events happened early in life\nthe trauma was caused by a parent or carer\nthe person experienced the trauma for a long time\nthe person was alone during the trauma\nthere is still contact with the person responsible for the trauma\n\nAs\u00a0it\u00a0may take years for the symptoms of complex PTSD to be recognised,\u00a0a child's\u00a0development, including their behaviour and self-confidence, can be altered as they get older.\nAdults with complex PTSD may lose their trust in people and feel separated from others.\nSymptoms of complex PTSD\nThe symptoms of complex PTSD are similar to symptoms of PTSD\u00a0but may include:\n\nfeelings of shame or guilt\ndifficulty controlling your emotions\nperiods of losing attention and concentration \u2013 this is known as dissociation\nphysical symptoms \u2013 such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches\ncutting yourself off from friends and family\nrelationship difficulties\ndestructive or risky behaviour \u2013 such as self-harm,\u00a0alcohol misuse or drug abuse\nsuicidal\u00a0thoughts\n\nTreating complex PTSD\nOne of the key symptoms of complex PTSD is losing trust in people. If possible, people with complex PTSD are recommended to slowly start doing regular activities such as:\n\nfinding friends\ngetting a job\nregular exercise\ntaking on hobbies\n\nIt's important to try and develop some feelings of trust.\u00a0It may take some time, but a\u00a0trusting relationship with a therapist\u00a0will help\u00a0treat complex PTSD.\nTreatment from a therapist may be given in three stages, described below.\nOne of the first steps in treating complex PTSD may involve speaking with a therapist to learn how to control feelings of distrust and lose the feeling of being 'disconnected' from friends and family.\nCertain techniques, known as 'grounding' techniques, may be able to help you separate an abusive or traumatic past from the present. The aim is to make the past seem less frightening and reduce the amount of flashbacks you experience.\nWith time, you can begin to experience less anxiety and learn to cope with daily life.\nTrauma-focused therapy\u00a0may include:\n\ncertain types of psychotherapy\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\neye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)\n\nThese treatments may help you to control any distressing thoughts but must be approached carefully to avoid making the situation worse.\nThe final stage is to begin to use these skills and techniques to\u00a0develop better relationships with other people.\nMedication, such as antidepressants, may still be recommended if psychotherapy isn't possible or you feel unsafe.\nYou can read more information about complex PTSD on the Royal College of Psychiatrists website.\n\n\nIf you think you\u2019re experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), it\u2019s important for you to visit your GP and discuss your concerns. The PTSD and CPTSD self-help guide can help with managing symptoms while you wait for an assessment by your GP or a mental health professional.\nThis guide aims to help you:\n\nconsider whether you\u2019re experiencing symptoms of PTSD or CPTSD\nunderstand more about PTSD and\u00a0CPTSD\nthink about ways to manage or recover from PTSD or CPTSD\n\nThe PTSD and CPTSD self-help guide is based on Trauma-Focused Cognitive Therapy (TF-CT). TF-CT aims to help people who have been through trauma and adversity to make sense of what they\u2019ve experienced, and become less distressed and affected by it.\nWork through a self-help guide for PTSD and CPTSD based on Trauma-Focused Cognitive Therapy (TF-CT).\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Postnatal depression is a type of depression that many parents experience after having a baby.\nIt's a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 women within a year of giving birth.

Some of the factors it has been associated with include:\n\na history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life\na history of mental health problems during pregnancy\nhaving no close family or friends to support you\na poor relationship with your partner\nrecent stressful life events, such as a bereavement\nexperiencing the \"baby blues\"\n\nEven if you don't have any of these symptoms, having a baby is a life-changing event that can sometimes trigger depression.\nIt often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent. Looking after a small baby can be stressful and exhausting.\nCan postnatal depression be prevented?\nAlthough there have been several studies into preventing postnatal depression, there is no evidence that there\u2019s anything specific you can do to prevent the condition developing, apart from maintaining as healthy a lifestyle as you can for yourself.\nHowever, if you have a history of depression or mental health problems, or if you have a family history of mental health problems after childbirth, tell your GP or mental health team if you\u2019re pregnant or thinking of having a baby. This is so they can offer you appropriate monitoring and treatment, if necessary.\nIf you have had a mental health problem while pregnant, your doctor should arrange for you to be seen regularly in the first few weeks after birth.\n\n\nPostnatal depression can affect women in different ways.

Some parents may avoid talking to family and friends about how they\u2019re feeling because they worry they\u2019ll be judged for not coping or not appearing happy.\nSigns for partners, family and friends to look out for in new parents include:\n\nfrequently crying for no obvious reason\nhaving difficulty bonding with their baby, looking after them only as a duty and not wanting to play with them\nwithdrawing from contact with other people\nspeaking negatively all the time and claiming that they're hopeless\nneglecting themselves, such as not washing or changing their clothes\nlosing all sense of time, such as being unaware whether 10 minutes or two hours have passed\nlosing their sense of humour\nconstantly worrying that something is wrong with their baby, regardless of reassurance\n\nIf you think someone you know is depressed, encourage them to talk about their feelings to you, a friend, their GP or their health visitor.\n\n\nSpeak to your GP or health visitor as soon as possible if you think you might have postnatal depression.\nWith appropriate treatment and support, most women make a full recovery, although it can take time.\nThe three main types of treatment are self-help strategies, therapy and medication, which are all described in more detail below. Talk to your GP about the pros and cons of different treatments so you can decide together what\u2019s best for you.\nYour GP might also want to check your physical health to see if there are any problems that may need to be addressed as well. For instance, you may be anaemic after having given birth and that could add to any feelings of depression you might have.\nSelf-help\nLooking after a baby can be stressful and challenging for anyone, and it can be even tougher if you're dealing with postnatal depression as well.\nThere are a number of things you can try yourself to improve your symptoms and help you cope. These include:\n\ntalk to your partner, friends and family \u2013 try to help them understand how you're feeling and what they can do to support you\ndon't try to be a \"supermum\" \u2013 accept help from others when it's offered and ask your loved ones if they can help look after the baby and do tasks such as housework, cooking and shopping\nmake time for yourself \u2013 try to do activities that you find relaxing and enjoyable, such as going for a walk, listening to music, reading a book or having a warm bath\nrest when you can \u2013 although it can be difficult when you\u2019re looking after a baby, try to sleep whenever you get the chance, follow good sleeping habits\u00a0and ask your partner to help with the night-time work\nexercise regularly \u2013 this has been shown to help boost mood in people with mild depression\neat regular,\u00a0healthy meals and don't go for long periods without eating\ndon't drink\u00a0alcohol or take drugs, as this can make you feel worse\n\nAsk your health visitor about support services in your area. They may be able to put you in touch with a social worker, counsellor or local support group. It can be reassuring to meet other women who are going through something similar.\nFind postnatal depression support and information in your area.\nPsychological treatments\nPsychological therapies are usually the first treatment recommended for women with postnatal depression.\nThe main types used are described below.\nGuided self-help involves working through a book or an\u00a0online course on your own or with some help from a therapist.\nThe course materials focus on the issues you might be facing, with practical advice on how to deal with them.\nThe courses typically last 9 to 12 weeks.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour.\nCBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave in a more positive way.\nFor example, some women have unrealistic expectations about what being a mum is like and feel they should never make mistakes. As part of CBT, you'll be encouraged to see that these thoughts are unhelpful and discuss ways to think more positively.\nCBT can be carried out either one-to-one with a therapist or in a group. Treatment will often last three to four months.\nInterpersonal therapy (IPT) involves talking to a therapist about the problems you're experiencing.\nIt aims to identify problems in your relationships with family, friends or partners and how they might relate to your feelings of depression.\nTreatment also usually lasts three to four months.\nAntidepressants\nAntidepressants may be recommended if you have moderate or severe depression and you don't want to try psychological treatment or psychological treatment\u00a0doesn't help.\nThey may also be used if you have mild postnatal depression and a previous history of depression.\nAntidepressants work by balancing mood-altering chemicals in your brain.\u00a0They can help ease symptoms such as low mood, irritability, lack of concentration and sleeplessness, allowing you to function normally and helping you\u00a0cope better with your new baby.\nAntidepressants usually need to be taken for at least a week before the benefit starts to be felt, so it's important to keep taking them even if you don't notice an improvement straight away. You'll usually need to take them for around six months after you start to feel better. If you stop too early, your depression may return.\nIf you\u2019re breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about suitable medicines, as not all antidepressants are safe to take while breastfeeding.\nYour doctor should explain any risks of taking antidepressants and you should be offered the type with the least risk for you and your baby.\nGeneral\u00a0side effects of\u00a0antidepressants include:\n\nfeeling sick\nblurred vision\na\u00a0dry mouth\nconstipation\ndizziness\u00a0\nfeeling agitated or shaky\n\nThese side effects should pass once your body gets used to the medication.\nSevere postnatal depression\nIf your postnatal depression is very severe and it doesn't respond to the treatments above, you'll probably be\u00a0referred to a specialist mental health team.\nYour\u00a0team will be able to try additional treatments, such as:\n\nmore intensive CBT\nother psychological treatments, such as\u00a0psychotherapy\ntherapies such as baby massage to help you bond better with your baby, if this has become a problem\ndifferent medications\nelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\u00a0\u2013 where electrodes are placed on your head and pulses of electricity are sent through\u00a0the brain, which may improve your mood by changing the balance of chemicals in your brain\n\nIf it's thought that your depression is so severe that you're at risk of harming yourself or others, you may be admitted to hospital or a mental health clinic.\nYour baby can either be looked after by your partner or family until you're well enough to return home, or you can stay in a specialised \"mother and baby\" mental health unit.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Pressure ulcers are an injury that breaks down the skin and underlying tissue. They are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure.\nThey are sometimes known as \"bedsores\" or \"pressure sores\".\nPressure ulcers can range in severity from patches of discoloured skin to open wounds that expose the underlying bone or muscle.\nRead more about the symptoms of pressure ulcers.\nHow pressure ulcers develop\nPressure\u00a0ulcers can\u00a0develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. They can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time.\nThe extra pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin. Without a blood supply, the affected skin becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming.\nPressure ulcers tend to affect people with health conditions that make it difficult to move, especially\u00a0those confined to lying in\u00a0a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time.\nConditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such as type 2 diabetes, can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers.\nLearn more\u00a0about the\u00a0causes of pressure ulcers.\nWho is affected?\nIt's estimated that just under half a million people in the UK will develop at least 1\u00a0pressure ulcer in any given year. This is usually people with an underlying health condition \u2013 for example, around\u00a01 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with a sudden illness will develop a pressure ulcer.\nPeople over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin.\nTreating and preventing pressure ulcers\nTreatment for pressure ulcers includes the use of dressings, creams and gels designed to speed up the healing process and relieve pressure. Surgery is sometimes recommended for the most serious cases.\nFor some people, pressure ulcers are an inconvenience that require minor nursing care. For others, they can be serious\u00a0and lead to life-threatening complications, such as blood poisoning or\u00a0gangrene.\u00a0\nRead more about the complications of pressure ulcers.\nPressure ulcers can be unpleasant, upsetting and challenging to treat. Therefore, a range of techniques\u00a0is used to prevent them developing in the first place. These include:\n\nregularly changing a person's position\nusing equipment to protect vulnerable parts of the body \u2013 such as specially designed mattresses and cushions\n\nRead about\u00a0treating pressure ulcers and\u00a0preventing pressure ulcers for more information.\nUnfortunately, even with the highest standards of care, it's not always possible to prevent pressure ulcers in particularly vulnerable people.\n\n\nThe parts of the body most at risk of developing pressure ulcers are those that are not covered by a large amount of body fat and are in direct contact with a supporting surface, such as a bed or a wheelchair.\nFor example, if you are unable to get out of bed, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on your:\n\nshoulders or shoulder blades\nelbows\nback of your head\nrims of your ears\nknees, ankles, heels or toes\nspine\ntail bone (the small bone at the bottom of your spine)\n\nIf you are a wheelchair user, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on:\n\nyour buttocks\nthe back of your arms and legs\nthe back of your hip bone\n\nSeverity\u00a0of pressure ulcers\nHealthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe the severity of pressure ulcers. The most common is the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) grading system. The higher the grade, the more severe the injury to the skin and underlying tissue.\u00a0\nA grade 1\u00a0pressure ulcer is the most superficial type of ulcer. The affected area of skin appears discoloured \u2013 it is red in white people, and purple or blue in people with darker-coloured skin. Grade 1\u00a0pressure ulcers do not turn white when pressure is placed on them. The skin remains intact, but it may hurt or itch. It may also\u00a0feel either warm and spongy, or hard.\nIn grade 2\u00a0pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged, leading to skin loss. The ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister.\nIn grade 3\u00a0pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. The underlying tissue is also damaged, although the underlying muscle and bone are not. The ulcer appears as a deep, cavity-like wound.\nA grade 4\u00a0pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. The skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). The underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged.\nPeople with grade 4\u00a0pressure ulcers have a high risk of developing a life-threatening infection.\u00a0\n\n\nPressure ulcers are caused by sustained pressure being placed on a particular part of the body.\nThis pressure interrupts the blood supply to the affected area of skin. Blood contains oxygen and other nutrients that are needed to help keep tissue healthy. Without a constant blood supply, tissue is\u00a0damaged\u00a0and will eventually die.\nThe lack of blood supply also means that the skin no longer receives infection-fighting white blood cells. Once an ulcer has developed, it can become infected by bacteria.\nPeople with normal mobility do not develop pressure ulcers, as their body automatically makes hundreds of regular movements that prevent pressure building up on any part of their body.\nFor example, you may think that you are lying still when asleep, but you may shift position up to 20 times a night.\nPressure ulcers can be caused by:\n\npressure from a hard surface \u2013 such as a bed or wheelchair\npressure that is placed on the skin through involuntary muscle movements \u2013 such as muscle spasms\nmoisture \u2013 which can break down the outer layer of the skin (epidermis)\n\nThe time it takes for a pressure ulcer to form will depend on:\n\nthe amount of pressure\nhow vulnerable a person's skin is to damage\n\nGrade 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0pressure ulcers can develop quickly. For example, in susceptible people, a full-thickness pressure ulcer can sometimes develop in just 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0hours. However, in some cases, the damage will only become apparent a few days after the injury has occurred.\u00a0\nThere are\u00a0several factors\u00a0that increase the risk of\u00a0developing pressure ulcers. These include:\n\nmobility problems \u2013\u00a0anything that affects your ability to move some or all of your body\npoor nutrition \u2013\u00a0for your skin to remain healthy, it requires nutrients that can only be supplied by eating a nutritious diet\nan underlying health condition that disrupts your blood supply or makes your skin more vulnerable to injury and damage\nbeing over 70 years old\nurinary\u00a0incontinence and/or\u00a0bowel incontinence\nserious mental health conditions\n\nThese are discussed in more detail below.\nPossible reasons for having a mobility problem are:\n\nhaving a spinal cord injury that causes some or all of your limbs to be\u00a0paralysed\nbrain damage caused by an event such as a\u00a0stroke or severe head injury, which results in paralysis\u00a0\nhaving a condition that is causing progressive damage to the nerves your body uses to move parts of the body \u2013 such as Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson's disease\u00a0\nhaving severe pain that makes it difficult to move some or all of your body\nhaving a fractured or broken bone\nrecovering from the effects of surgery\nbeing in a\u00a0coma\nhaving a condition\u00a0that makes it difficult to move your joints and bones \u2013 such as rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0\n\nReasons that your diet may lack nutrition include:\n\nanorexia nervosa\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a mental health condition where a person has an unhealthy obsession with maintaining a low body weight\u00a0\u00a0\ndehydration\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you do not have enough fluids in your body\ndysphagia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0difficulty swallowing food\n\nHealth conditions that can make you more vulnerable to pressure ulcers include:\n\ntype 1 diabetes and\u00a0type 2 diabetes \u2013\u00a0the high levels of blood sugar associated with diabetes can disrupt normal blood flow\nperipheral arterial disease (PAD)\u00a0\u2013 blood supply in the legs becomes restricted due to a build-up of fatty substances in the arteries\nheart failure\u00a0\u2013\u00a0previous damage to the heart means it is no longer able to pump enough blood around the body\nkidney failure\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the kidney loses most or all of its functions,\u00a0which can lead to a build-up of dangerous toxins (poisons) in the blood that\u00a0can cause tissue damage\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\u00a0\u2013 a collection of lung diseases; the low levels of oxygen in the blood associated with COPD can make the skin more vulnerable to damage\n\nThere are several reasons why ageing skin is more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. These include:\n\nwith age, the skin loses some of its elasticity (stretchiness), which makes it more vulnerable to damage\nreduced blood flow to the skin, due to the effects of ageing\nthe amount of fat under the skin tends to decrease as people get older\n\nBoth urinary incontinence (inability to control your bladder) and bowel incontinence (inability to control your bowels) can cause certain areas of the skin to become moist and vulnerable to infection. This can cause pressure ulcers to form.\nPeople with severe mental health conditions such as schizophrenia (a condition where people have problems telling the difference between reality and imagination) or severe depression have an increased risk of pressure ulcers for a number of reasons. These include:\n\ntheir diet tends to be poor\nthey often have other physical health conditions, such as diabetes or incontinence\nthey may neglect their personal hygiene, making their skin more vulnerable to injury and infection\n\n\n\nPressure ulcers are easily diagnosed by looking at them. However, health professionals prefer to prevent ulcers developing in the first place, so it's important to assess a person's risk of developing them.\nAs part of the risk assessment process, the following will be considered:\n\nyour general health\nyour ability to move\nwhether you have any problems that may affect your posture\nwhether you have any symptoms that may indicate an infection\nyour mental health\nwhether you have had pressure ulcers in the past\nwhether you have\u00a0urinary incontinence or bowel incontinence\u00a0\nyour diet\nhow well your blood circulation system is working\n\nAs part of the risk assessment, you may be referred for blood and urine tests.\u00a0Blood tests can be a good way of assessing your general state of health and whether your diet is providing enough nutrition.\nUrine tests can be used to check how well your kidneys are working and whether you have a urinary tract infection, which can be a cause\u00a0for concern if you are incontinent or if you have had spinal damage.\nSelf-assessment\nIf you are thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, but you are not staying in a hospital or care home, you may be advised to regularly\u00a0check for early signs of the condition.\nLook out for areas of discolouration and patches of skin that feel unusually spongy or tough to the touch. Use a mirror to check parts of your body that can be difficult to see, such as your back or buttocks. Contact your GP or your healthcare team if you notice any signs of damage.\n\n\nTreatment for pressure ulcers can vary, depending on the grade of the ulcer. Treatment options may include regularly changing your position, or using special mattresses and dressings to relieve pressure or protect the skin. In some cases, surgery may be needed.\nYour care team\nPressure ulcers are a complex health problem arising from many interrelated factors. Therefore, your care may be provided by a team comprising different types of healthcare professionals. This type of team is sometimes known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\nYour MDT may include:\n\na tissue viability nurse (a nurse who specialises in wound care and prevention)\na social worker\na physiotherpist\nan occupational therapist\na dietitian\nmedical and surgical experts with experience in pressure ulcer management\n\nChanging position\nIt's important to avoid putting pressure on areas that are vulnerable to pressure ulcers or where pressure ulcers have already formed. Moving and regularly changing your position helps to prevent pressure ulcers developing and relieves the pressure on\u00a0the ulcers that have developed.\nAfter your risk assessment is completed, your care team will draw up a \"repositioning timetable\", which states how often you need to be moved. For some people, this may be as often as once every 15 minutes. Others may need to be moved only once every 2\u00a0hours.\nThe risk assessment will also consider the most effective way of avoiding putting any vulnerable areas of skin under pressure whenever possible.\nYou may also be given training and advice about:\n\ncorrect sitting and lying positions\nhow you can adjust your sitting and lying position\nhow often you need to move or be moved\nhow best to support your feet\nhow to maintain good posture\nthe special equipment you should use and how to use it\n\nMattresses and cushions\nThere are a range of special mattresses and cushions that can relieve pressure on vulnerable parts of the body. Your care team will discuss the types of mattresses and cushions most suitable for you.\nThose\u00a0thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, or who have pre-existing grade 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0pressure ulcers, usually benefit from a\u00a0specially designed foam mattress, which relieves the pressure on their body.\nPeople with a grade 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0pressure ulcer will require a more sophisticated mattress or bed system. For example, there are mattresses that can be connected to a constant flow of air, which is automatically regulated to reduce pressure as and when required.\nDressings\nSpecially designed dressings and bandages\u00a0can be used to protect pressure ulcers and speed up the healing process. Examples of these types of dressings include:\n\nhydrocolloid dressings \u2013\u00a0these contain a special gel that encourages the growth of new skin cells in the ulcer, while keeping the surrounding healthy area of skin dry\u00a0\nalginate dressings \u2013\u00a0these are made from seaweed and contain sodium and calcium, which are known to speed up the healing process\n\nCreams and ointments\nTopical preparations, such as creams and ointments, can be used to help speed up the healing process and prevent further tissue damage.\nAntibiotics\nIf you have a pressure ulcer, you will not routinely be prescribed antibiotics. These are usually only prescribed to treat an infected pressure ulcer and prevent the infection from spreading.\nAntiseptic cream may also be applied directly to pressure ulcers to clear out any bacteria that may be present.\nNutrition\nCertain dietary supplements, such as protein, zinc and vitamin C, have been shown to accelerate wound healing.\nIf your diet lacks these vitamins and minerals, your skin may be more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers. As a result of this, you may be referred to a dietitian so that a suitable dietary plan can be drawn up for you.\nDebridement\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to remove dead tissue from the ulcer to help stimulate the healing process. This procedure is known as debridement.\nIf there is a small amount of dead tissue, it may be possible to remove it using specially designed dressings and paste. Larger amounts of dead tissue may be removed using mechanical means. Some mechanical debridement techniques include:\n\ncleansing and pressure irrigation \u2013\u00a0where dead tissue is removed using high-pressure water jets\nultrasound \u2013 dead tissue is removed using low-frequency energy waves\nlaser \u2013\u00a0dead tissue is removed using focused beams of light\nsurgical debridement \u2013\u00a0dead tissue is removed using surgical instruments, such as scalpels and forceps\n\nA\u00a0local anaesthetic will be used to numb the area of skin and tissue around the ulcer so that debridement does not cause any pain or discomfort.\nMaggot therapy\nMaggot therapy, also known as larvae therapy, is an alternative method of debridement. Maggots are ideal for debridement because they feed on dead and infected tissue without touching healthy tissue. They also help to fight infection by releasing substances that kill bacteria and stimulate the healing process.\nDuring maggot therapy, the maggots are mixed into a wound dressing and the area is covered with gauze. After a few days, the dressing is taken off and the maggots are removed.\nMany people may find the idea of maggot therapy off-putting, but research has found that it is often more effective than more traditional methods of debridement.\u00a0\nSurgery\nIt's not always possible for a grade 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0pressure ulcer to heal. In such cases, surgery will be required to seal the wound and prevent any further tissue damage occurring.\nSurgical treatment involves cleaning the wound and closing it by bringing together the edges of the wound (direct closure), or by using tissue moved from a nearby part of the body (flap reconstruction).\nPressure ulcer surgery can be challenging, especially because most people who have the procedure are already in a poor state of health. There is a risk of a large number of possible complications occurring after surgery, including:\n\ninfection\ntissue death of the implanted flap\nmuscle weakness\nblisters\u00a0(small pockets of fluid that develop inside the skin)\nrecurrence of the pressure ulcers\nblood poisoning\ninfection of the bone (osteomyelitis)\ninternal bleeding\nabscesses\u00a0(painful collections of pus that develop inside the body)\ndeep vein thrombosis\u00a0(a blood clot that develops inside the veins of the leg)\n\nDespite the risks, surgery is often a necessity to prevent life-threatening complications, such as blood poisoning and gangrene (the decay or death of living tissue).\n\n\nEven with the best possible medical care, complications can arise from grade 3\u00a0or grade 4\u00a0pressure ulcers and can occasionally be life-threatening.\nThese complications are discussed below.\nCellulitis\nInfection can spread from the site of the pressure ulcer to a deeper layer of skin. This type of infection is called cellulitis. It causes symptoms of pain and redness, plus swelling of the skin. It will need to be treated with a course of antibiotics.\nRead more information\u00a0about\u00a0cellulitis.\nLeft untreated, there is a risk that the infection can spread to the blood (see below) or the underlying bone or joint. In rare cases, where pressure ulcers involve the lower back, tail bone and spine, the pressure ulcer can spread to the membranes that surround the spine and brain. This is known as meningitis.\nBlood poisoning\nIf a person with a weak immune system has a pressure ulcer that becomes infected, there is a risk that the infection will spread into their blood and other organs. This is known as blood poisoning or septicaemia.\nIn the most serious cases of blood poisoning, damage to multiple organs can lead to a large drop in blood pressure, known as septic shock, which can be fatal. Symptoms include cold skin and an increased heart beat.\nBlood poisoning is a medical emergency. It requires immediate treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), so that the functions of the body can be supported while the infection is treated with antibiotics or antiviral medication.\nRead more information\u00a0about\u00a0blood poisoning.\nBone and joint infection\nInfection can also spread from a pressure ulcer into underlying joints (septic arthritis) and bones (osteomyelitis).\nBoth of these infections can damage the cartilage, tissue and bone. They may also affect the joints and limbs.\nAntibiotics are required to treat bone and joint infections. In the most serious of cases, infected bones and joints may need to be surgically removed.\nNecrotising fasciitis\nNecrotising fasciitis, commonly known as \"flesh-eating\" bacteria, is a serious skin infection that causes rapid tissue death. It can occur when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with a particular type of bacteria,\u00a0such as\u00a0Group A streptococci.\nEmergency treatment is required. It involves a combination of antibiotics and surgical debridement of the dead tissue.\nGas gangrene\nGas gangrene is a serious but rare form of infection that occurs when a pressure ulcer becomes infected with the clostridium bacteria. The bacteria thrive in environments where there is little or no oxygen. They produce gases and release dangerous toxins. Symptoms of gas gangrene include severe pain and rapid swelling of the skin.\nGas gangrene requires immediate treatment with surgical debridement. In the most serious of cases, it may be necessary to amputate the affected body part to prevent the gangrene from spreading to the rest of the body.\n\n\nAs part of your treatment plan, your care team will discuss with you the best way to prevent pressure ulcers. This will be based on your individual circumstances.\nHowever, you may find that the general advice outlined below is helpful.\nChanging position\nMaking regular and frequent changes to your position is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. If a pressure ulcer has already developed, regularly changing position will help to avoid putting further pressure on it, and give the wound the best chance of healing.\nAs a general rule, wheelchair users will need to change their position at least once every 15 to 30 minutes. People who are confined to bed will need to change their position at least once every 2\u00a0hours.\nOnce you have developed a pressure ulcer, it's important that you minimise or avoid putting any further pressure on it to give the wound the best chance of healing.\nIf you are unable to change position yourself, a carer or relative will need to assist you. For more information and advice about positional changes, read about\u00a0treating pressure ulcers.\nNutrition\nEating a healthy, balanced diet that contains an adequate amount of protein and a good variety of vitamins and minerals can help prevent skin damage and speed up the healing process. You may be referred to a dietitian so that a dietary plan can be drawn up for you.\nIf you currently have a reduced appetite due to a pre-existing health condition, the following advice may be useful:\n\nTry eating smaller meals throughout the day, rather than 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0larger meals. Set a timetable for when you should eat, rather than waiting until you feel hungry. This should ensure that you receive the necessary nutrition.\nAvoid drinking large amounts of fluids just before you are about to eat, as this will make you feel fuller than you actually are.\nIf you find swallowing difficult, try drinking specially made nutritional drinks or pur\u00e9ed foods and soups.\nIf you are a vegetarian, it's important to eat high-protein alternatives to meat. Cheese, yoghurt, peanut butter, custard, beans and nuts are all good sources of protein.\n\nRead more information\u00a0about\u00a0healthy eating for more advice.\nChecking your skin\nIf you have known risk factors for pressure ulcers, it's important that you check your skin on a daily basis for any signs of pressure ulcers, such as discoloured areas of skin. This is particularly important if you have an underlying condition, such as nerve damage or diabetes, which may dampen or numb feelings of pain in certain parts of your body.\nYou can use a mirror to check the parts of your body that are difficult to see, such as your bottom and the heels of your feet. If you notice any damage, report it to your care team. If you are at home, contact your GP or community nurse. If you are in hospital or a nursing home, inform one of your nurses or carers.\nQuit smoking\nIf you are a smoker, giving up is one of the most effective ways of preventing pressure ulcers. Smoking reduces the levels of oxygen in your blood. It also weakens your immune system, which increases your risk of developing pressure ulcers.\nRead about\u00a0quitting smoking\u00a0for further information and advice about giving up smoking.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and anyone with a prostate in the UK.\nProstate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years.\nSymptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis).\nWhen this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied.\nThese symptoms shouldn\u2019t be ignored, but they do not mean you definitely have prostate cancer. It is more likely that they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement).\nRead more about the symptoms of\u00a0prostate cancer\nWhat is the prostate?\nThe prostate is a small gland in the pelvis. About the size of a satsuma, it's located between the penis and the bladder and\u00a0surrounds the urethra.\nThe main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. It produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen.\nWhy does prostate cancer happen?\nThe causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. However, certain things\u00a0can increase your risk of developing the condition.\nThe chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or older.\nFor reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in men and anyone with a prostate of African-Caribbean African descent. It's less common in men and anyone with a prostate of Asian descent.\nMen and anyone with a prostate who have\u00a0first-degree\u00a0male relatives (such as a father or brother) affected by prostate cancer are also at a slightly increased risk.\nRead more about the causes of prostate cancer\nTests for prostate cancer\nThere is no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you.\nThe most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are blood tests, a physical examination of your prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE) and a biopsy.\nThe blood test, known as a\u00a0prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, measures the level of PSA and may help detect early prostate cancer. Men and anyone with a prostate are not routinely offered PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable.\nThis is because the PSA blood test is not specific to prostate cancer. PSA can be raised due to a large non-cancerous growth of the prostate (BPH), a urinary tract infection or inflammation of the prostate, as well as prostate cancer. Raised PSA levels also cannot tell a doctor whether a man has life-threatening prostate cancer or not. This means a raised PSA can lead to unnecessary tests and treatment.\nHowever, you can ask to be tested for prostate cancer once the benefits and risks have been explained to you.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing prostate cancer and PSA screening for prostate cancer\nHow is prostate cancer treated?\nIn many cases,\u00a0treatment is not immediately necessary.\nIf the cancer is at an early stage and\u00a0not causing symptoms, a policy of 'watchful waiting' or 'active surveillance' may be adopted. This involves carefully monitoring your condition.\nSome cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages. Treatments include surgically removing the prostate, radiotherapy and hormone therapy.\nSome cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms.\nAll treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, including erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. For this reason, many people choose to delay treatment until there is a risk the cancer might spread.\nNewer treatments,\u00a0such as\u00a0high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)\u00a0or cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects.\u00a0Some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy. However, the long-term effectiveness of these treatments are not yet known.\nRead more about treating prostate cancer\nLiving with prostate cancer\nAs\u00a0prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, you can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.\nNevertheless, it can have an effect on your life. As well as causing physical problems such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, a diagnosis of prostate cancer can understandably make you feel anxious or depressed.\nYou may find it beneficial to talk about the condition with your family, friends, a family doctor and other people with prostate cancer.\nFinancial support is also available if prostate cancer reduces your ability to work.\nRead more about living with prostate cancer\n\n\nProstate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra.\nThis normally results in problems associated with urination. Symptoms can include:\n\nneeding to urinate more frequently, often during the night\nneeding to rush to the toilet\ndifficulty in starting to pee (hesitancy)\nstraining or taking a long time while urinating\nweak flow\nfeeling that your bladder has not emptied fully\n\nYour prostate may\u00a0get larger as you get older due to a non-cancerous condition known as prostate enlargement or benign prostatic hyperplasia.\nSymptoms that the cancer may have spread include bone and back pain, a loss of appetite, pain in the testicles and unexplained weight loss.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: prostate cancer symptoms\n\n\n\nIt's not known exactly what causes prostate cancer, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.\nThese include:\n\nage \u2013 risk\u00a0rises as you get older and\u00a0most cases are diagnosed in\u00a0men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age\nethnic group \u2013 prostate cancer is more common among men and anyone with a prostate of African-Caribbean and African descent than\u00a0in men and anyone with a prostate of Asian descent\nfamily history \u2013 having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it; having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing\u00a0prostate cancer\nobesity \u2013 there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer\nexercise \u2013 men and anyone with a prostate who regularly exercises have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer\ndiet \u2013 research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer; a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer\n\nIn addition, some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in\u00a0men and anyone with a prostate who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene, found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit, and selenium, found in brazil nuts. However, more research is needed.\nRead further information:\n\nProstate Cancer UK: who is at risk of prostate cancer\nCancer Research UK: prostate cancer risks and causes\n\n\n\nIf you have symptoms that could be caused by prostate cancer, you should visit your GP.\nThere is no single, definitive test for prostate cancer, so your GP\u00a0will discuss the pros and cons of the various tests with you to try to avoid unnecessary anxiety.\nYour doctor is likely to:\n\nask for a urine sample to check for infection\ntake a\u00a0blood sample to test your level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)\nexamine your prostate (digital rectal examination)\n\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected prostate cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nPSA testing\nPSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. All men and anyone with a prostate have a small amount of PSA in their blood, and it increases with age.\nProstate cancer can increase the production of PSA, and so a PSA test looks for raised levels of PSA in the blood that may\u00a0be a sign of the condition\u00a0in its early stages.\nHowever, PSA testing is not a specific test for prostate cancer. Most men and anyone with a prostate who has prostate cancer will not have a raised PSA level. Most people\u00a0with a raised PSA level will not have cancer, as PSA levels rise in all men and anyone with a prostate as they get older.\nRead more about PSA screening for prostate cancer\nDigital rectal examination (DRE)\nThe next step is a DRE, which can be done by your GP.\nDuring a DRE, your GP will insert a lubricated and gloved finger into your rectum. The rectum is close to your prostate gland, so your GP can check to feel if the surface of the gland has changed. This will feel a little uncomfortable, but should not be painful.\nProstate cancer can make the gland\u00a0hard and bumpy. However, in most cases, the cancer causes no changes to the gland and a DRE may not be able to detect the cancer.\nDRE is useful in ruling out\u00a0prostate enlargement caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, as this causes the gland to feel firm and smooth.\nBiopsy\nYour GP will assess your risk of having prostate cancer based on a number of factors, including your PSA levels, the results of your DRE, and your age, family history and ethnic group. If you are at risk, you\u00a0should be referred to hospital to discuss the options of further tests.\nThe most commonly used test is a transrectal ultrasound-guided\u00a0biopsy (TRUS). A biopsy may also be taken during a cystoscopy examination or through the skin behind the testicles (perineum).\nDuring a TRUS biopsy, an ultrasound probe (a machine that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your body) is inserted into your rectum. This allows the doctor or specialist nurse to see exactly where to pass a needle through the wall of your rectum to take small samples of tissue from your prostate.\nThe procedure can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, so you may be given a local anaesthetic to minimise any discomfort. As with any procedure, there may be complications, including bleeding and infection.\nAlthough it is more reliable than a PSA test, the TRUS biopsy\u00a0can have\u00a0problems. It can miss up to 1 in 5 cancers, because the location of the cancer is unknown when it is carried out. The doctors can see the prostate using the ultrasound scan, but not the tumour(s) if they are present.\nYou may need another biopsy if your symptoms persist, or your PSA level continues to rise. Your doctor may\u00a0request an MRI scan of the prostate before another biopsy.\nThe TRUS biopsy can also find small low-risk cancers that do not need treatment, but may cause you anxiety. Many people often choose to undergo surgery or radiotherapy that may not benefit them but causes side effects, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction.\nThe samples of tissue from the biopsy are studied in a laboratory. If cancerous cells are found, they can be studied further to see how quickly the cancer will spread. This process is known as 'staging and grading' and helps doctors to decide which treatment is the most appropriate.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: the stages of prostate cancer\nMacmillan: grading and staging of prostate cancer\n\nFurther testing\nIf there is a significant chance\u00a0the cancer has spread from your prostate to other parts of the body, further tests may be recommended.\nThese include:\n\na\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 these scans build a detailed picture of the inside of your body\nan isotope bone scan \u2013 this can tell if the cancer has spread to your bones; a small amount of radiation dye is injected into the vein and\u00a0collects in parts of the bone where there are any abnormalities\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: prostate cancer tests\n\n\n\nThere is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK. This is because it has not been proved that the benefits would outweigh the risks.\nPSA screening\nRoutinely screening all men and anyone with a prostate to check their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels is a controversial subject in the international medical community. There are several reasons for this:\n\nPSA tests are unreliable and can suggest prostate cancer when no cancer exists (a false-positive result) \u2013 this means that many men often have invasive and sometimes painful biopsies for no reason\nthe PSA test can find aggressive prostate cancer that needs treatment, but it can also find slow-growing cancer that may never cause symptoms or shorten life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0some men and anyone with a prostate may therefore face difficult decisions about treatment\ntreating prostate cancer in its early stages can be beneficial in some cases but the\u00a0side effects of the various treatments are potentially so serious that men may choose to delay treatment until it is absolutely necessary\nalthough screening has been shown to reduce a man's chance of dying from prostate cancer, it would mean many people receive treatment unnecessarily\n\nMore research is needed to determine whether a screening programme would provide men and anyone with a prostate with more benefit than harm.\nOne European study showed deaths from prostate cancer could be reduced by 20% if there was a screening programme, but this needs to be balanced against the harms of:\n\noverdiagnosis \u2013\u00a0people being diagnosed with a cancer\u00a0that will never cause symptoms or death during their lifetime\u00a0\novertreatment \u2013\u00a0people being treated unnecessarily for tumours that would be\u00a0unlikely to\u00a0be harmful\u00a0\u00a0\n\nImproving the test\nAs there are many reasons why PSA levels may be high at any one time, researchers are trying to make the PSA test, or a variation of it, more accurate. This includes looking at how PSA levels change over time and comparing the PSA level to prostate size.\nResearchers are also looking at whether new imaging tests, such as MRI scans, or other blood and urine tests, can be used to decide which people with an elevated PSA should have a biopsy.\nInstead of a national screening programme, there is an informed choice programme called prostate cancer risk management for healthy men and anyone with a prostate aged 50 or over who ask their GP about PSA testing. It aims to give men and anyone with a prostate good information on the pros and cons of a PSA test.\nIf you're aged\u00a050 or over with a prostate and decide to have your PSA levels tested after talking to your GP, they\u00a0will be able to arrange for it to be carried out for free on the NHS.\nIf results show you have a\u00a0raised level of PSA, your GP may suggest further tests.\nShould I have a PSA test?\nBecause the results of the PSA test are not as reliable as doctors would like, other tests and investigations are needed to diagnose prostate cancer.\nA PSA test cannot identify prostate cancer on its own, and changes in PSA levels alone are not a good reason to start treatment.\nIf you are thinking about asking for a PSA test, it is important that you first discuss whether it is right for you\u00a0with your GP so you understand what the results might mean.\nThe Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme has information on the risks and benefits of the PSA test to help you decide whether or not to have it.\n\n\nStaging of prostate cancer\nDoctors will use the results of your prostate examination, biopsy and scans to identify the\u00a0'stage' of your prostate cancer (how far the cancer has spread). The stage of the cancer will determine which types of treatments will be necessary.\nA widely used method of staging is\u00a0a\u00a0number staging system. The stages are:\n\nstage 1 \u2013 the cancer is very small and completely within the prostate gland\nstage 2 \u2013 the cancer is within the prostate gland, but is larger\nstage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread from the prostate and may have grown into the tubes that carry semen\nstage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes or another part of the body, including the bladder, rectum or bones; about 20 to 30% of cases are diagnosed at this stage\u00a0\n\nIf prostate cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of survival are generally good.\u00a0\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: the stages of prostate cancer\n\nWatchful waiting\nWatchful waiting\u00a0is often recommended for older men and anyone with a prostate when it is unlikely that the cancer\u00a0will affect your natural life span.\nIf the cancer is in its early stages and not causing symptoms, you may decide to delay treatment, and wait to see if any symptoms of progressive cancer develop. If this happens, pain medication and hormone medication to control prostate cancer are usually used.\nWatchful waiting may also be recommended for people with a higher risk of prostate cancer if:\n\nyour general health means you are unable to receive\u00a0any form of treatment\nyour life expectancy means you will die with the cancer rather than from it\n\nIn this case, hormone treatment may be started if there are symptoms caused by the prostate cancer.\nActive surveillance\nActive surveillance aims to avoid unnecessary treatment of harmless cancers, while still providing timely treatment for men and anyone with a prostate who needs it.\nWhen they are diagnosed, around half to two-thirds of men and anyone with a prostate with low-risk prostate cancer do not need\u00a0treatment. Surveillance is a safe strategy that provides a period of observation to gather extra information over time to see whether the disease is changing.\nActive surveillance involves you having regular PSA tests and\u00a0often several\u00a0biopsies to ensure\u00a0any signs of progression are found as early as possible. Sometimes, MRI scans may also be carried out. If these tests reveal the cancer is changing or progressing,\u00a0you can then make a decision about further treatment.\nAbout 1 in 3 people who undergo surveillance will later have treatment. This does not mean they made the wrong initial decision. Good evidence shows\u00a0that active surveillance is safe over an average of 6 years. Men undergoing active surveillance\u00a0will have delayed any treatment-related side effects, and those who eventually need treatment\u00a0will be reassured\u00a0that it was necessary.\nRadical prostatectomy\nA radical prostatectomy is the surgical removal of your prostate gland. This treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer.\nLike any operation, this surgery carries some risks, and there may be some side effects:\n\nsome people have problems with urinary incontinence\u00a0\u2013 this can range from leaking small drips of urine, to leaking larger amounts but this usually clears up within 3 to 6 months of the operation\nsome men have problems getting an erection (erectile dysfunction) \u2013 this sometimes improves with time, but around half will have long-term problems\nin extremely rare cases, problems arising after surgery can be fatal\n\nFor many men and anyone with a prostate, having a radical prostatectomy will get rid of the cancer cells. However, for around 1 in 3 people, the cancer cells may not be fully removed, and the cancer cells may return sometime after the operation.\nRadiotherapy after prostate removal surgery may increase the chances of a cure, although research is still being carried out into when it should be used after surgery.\nAfter a radical prostatectomy, you will no longer ejaculate during sex. This means\u00a0that you will not be able to have a child through sexual intercourse. You may want to ask your doctors about storing a sperm sample before the operation, so\u00a0it can be used later for in vitro fertilisation (IVF).\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan: surgery for early prostate cancer\n\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0involves using radiation to kill cancerous cells. This treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer. Radiotherapy can also be used to slow the progression of metastatic prostate cancer and relieve symptoms.\nRadiotherapy is normally given as an outpatient at a hospital near you. It is done in short sessions for 5 days a week, for 4 to 8 weeks. There are short-term and long-term side effects associated with radiotherapy.\nYou may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of successful treatment. Hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning.\nShort-term effects of radiotherapy can include:\n\ndiscomfort around the rectum and anus (the opening through which stools pass out of your body)\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nloss of pubic hair\ntiredness\ncystitis \u2013 an inflammation of the bladder lining, which can cause you to urinate frequently; urination may be painful\n\nPossible long-term side effects can include:\n\nan inability to obtain an erection\nurinary incontinence\nback passage problems (diarrhoea, bleeding, discomfort)\n\nAs with radical prostatectomy, there is a 1 in3 chance the cancer will return. In these cases, medication is usually used to control the cancer instead of surgery. This is because there is a higher risk of complications from surgery in men and anyone with a prostate who have previously had radiotherapy.\nSome hospitals now offer new minimally invasive treatments if radiotherapy fails to work, sometimes\u00a0as part of a clinical\u00a0trial. These new treatments are called high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy. These treatments have fewer side effects, but the long-term outcomes are not yet known.\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan: radiotherapy for early prostate cancer\n\nBrachytherapy\nBrachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where the radiation dose is delivered inside the prostate gland. It is also known as internal or interstitial radiotherapy.\nThe radiation can be delivered using a number of tiny radioactive seeds that are surgically implanted into the tumour. This is called low dose-rate brachytherapy.\nThe radiation can also be delivered through hollow, thin needles placed inside the prostate. This is called high dose-rate brachytherapy.\nThis method has the advantage of delivering a high dose of radiation to the prostate, while minimising damage to other tissues. However, the risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary problems is the same as with radiotherapy, although the risk of bowel problems is slightly lower.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) for prostate cancer\n\nHormone therapy\nHormone therapy is often used in combination with radiotherapy. For example, you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of a successful treatment. Hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning.\nHormone therapy alone should not normally be used to treat\u00a0localised prostate cancer in\u00a0people who are fit and willing to receive surgery or radiotherapy. This is because it does not cure the cancer on its own.\u00a0Hormone therapy\u00a0can be used to slow the progression of advanced prostate cancer and relieve symptoms.\nHormones control the growth of cells in the prostate. In particular, prostate cancer needs the hormone testosterone to grow. The purpose of hormone therapy is to block the effects of testosterone, either by stopping its production or by stopping your body being able to use testosterone.\nHormone therapy can be given as:\n\ninjections to stop your body making testosterone, called luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists\ntablets to block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone, called anti-androgen treatment\ncombined LHRH and anti-androgen treatment\n\nThe main side effects of hormone treatment are caused by their effects on testosterone. They usually go away when treatment stops. They include\u00a0loss of sex drive and erectile dysfunction (this is more common with LHRH agonists than anti-androgens).\nOther possible side effects include:\n\nhot flushes\nsweating\nweight gain\nswelling and tenderness of the breasts\n\nAn alternative to hormone therapy is to surgically remove the testicles, called orchidectomy. The operation does not cure prostate cancer, but by removing the testosterone, it controls the growth of the cancer and its symptoms.\u00a0\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: hormone therapy for prostate cancer\n\nTrans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP)\nDuring\u00a0TURP, a\u00a0thin metal wire with a loop at the end is inserted into your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to your penis) and pieces of the prostate are removed.\nThis is carried out under\u00a0general anaesthetic or a spinal anaesthetic (epidural).\nThis is done to relieve pressure from the urethra to treat any problematic symptoms you may have with urination. It does not cure the cancer.\nRead more information about\u00a0transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).\nHigh intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)\nHIFU is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate.\nAn ultrasound probe\u00a0inserted into the rectum releases high-frequency sound waves through the wall of the rectum. These sound waves kill cancer cells in the prostate gland by heating them to a high temperature.\nThe risk of side effects\u00a0from HIFU\u00a0is\u00a0usually lower than other treatments.\nHowever, possible effects can include impotence (in 5 to 10 in every 100) or urinary incontinence (in less than 1 in every 100). Back passage problems are rare.\nFistulas (an abnormal channel between the urinary system and rectum) are also rare, affecting less than 1 in every 500. This is because the treatment targets the cancer area only and not the whole prostate.\nHowever, HIFU treatment is still going through clinical trials for prostate cancer.\u00a0In some cases, doctors can carry out HIFU treatment outside of clinical trials. HIFU is not widely available and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for prostate cancer\n\nCryotherapy\nCryotherapy is a method of killing cancer cells by freezing them. It is sometimes used to treat men and anyone with a prostate with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate gland.\nTiny probes called cryoneedles are inserted into the prostate gland through the wall of the rectum. They freeze the prostate gland and kill the cancer cells, but some normal cells also die.\nThe aim is to kill cancer cells while causing as little damage as possible to healthy cells. The side effects of cryotherapy can include:\n\nerectile dysfunction \u2013 this can affect between 2 and 9 in every 10\nincontinence \u2013 this affects less than 1 in 20\n\nIt is rare for cryotherapy to cause\u00a0rectal problems or fistulas.\nCryotherapy\u00a0is still undergoing clinical trials for prostate cancer. In some cases, doctors can carry out cryotherapy treatment outside of clinical trials.\u00a0It\u00a0is not widely available\u00a0and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven.\nTreating advanced prostate cancer\nIf the cancer has reached an advanced stage, it is no longer possible to cure it. However, it may be possible to slow its progression, prolong your life and relieve symptoms.\nTreatment options include:\n\nradiotherapy\nhormone treatment\nchemotherapy\n\nIf the cancer has spread to your bones, medicines called bisphosphonates may be used. Bisphosphonates help reduce bone pain and bone loss.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0is mainly used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer) and which is not responding to hormone therapy.\nChemotherapy destroys cancer cells by interfering with the way they multiply. Chemotherapy does not cure prostate cancer, but can keep it under control and reduce symptoms (such as pain) so everyday life is less affected.\nThe main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their effects on healthy cells, such as immune cells. They include infections, tiredness, hair loss, sore mouth, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Many of these side effects can be prevented or controlled with other medicines, which your doctor can prescribe for you.\nSteroids\nSteroid tablets are used when hormone therapy no longer works because the cancer is resistant to it. This is called hormone-refractory cancer.\nSteroids can be used to try to shrink the tumour and stop it from growing. The most effective steroid treatment is dexamethasone.\nOther medical treatments\nThere are a number of new medications that could be used if hormones and chemotherapy fail. Your medical team\u00a0can tell you if these are suitable and available for you.\nNICE has recently issued guidance on medications called abiraterone and\u00a0enzalutamide.\u00a0\nRead the NICE guidelines on:\n\nenzalutamide for metastatic hormone-relapsed prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel\nabiraterone for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen\n\nDeciding against treatment\nAs many of the treatments above have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life, you may decide against treatment. This may be especially true if you are at an age when you feel that treating the cancer is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy.\nThis is entirely your decision, and your MDT will respect it.\nIf you decide not to have treatment, your GP and hospital team will still give you support and pain relief. This is called palliative care. Support is also available for your family and friends.\n\n\nImpact on everyday activities\nIf you have no symptoms, prostate cancer should have little or no effect on your everyday activities. You should be able to work, care for your family, carry on your usual social and leisure activities, and look after yourself. However, you may be understandably worried about your future. This may make you feel anxious\u00a0or depressed,\u00a0and affect your sleep.\nIf your prostate cancer progresses, you may not feel well enough to do all the things you used to. After an operation or other treatment, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, you will probably feel tired and need time to recover.\nIf you have advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, you may have symptoms that slow you down and make it difficult to do things. You may have to reduce your working hours or stop working altogether.\nWhatever stage your prostate cancer has reached, try to give yourself time to do the things you enjoy and spend time with those who care about you.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: coping with prostate cancer\n\nComplications of prostate cancer\nErection problems\nIf you have erectile dysfunction, speak to your GP. It may be possible to treat you with a type of medicine known as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5). PDE5s work by increasing the blood supply to your penis.\nThe most commonly used PDE5 is sildenafil (Viagra). Other PDE5s are available if sildenafil is not effective.\nAnother alternative is a device called a vacuum pump. It is a simple tube connected to a pump. You place your penis in the tube and then pump out all the air. This creates a vacuum, which causes the blood to rush to your penis. You then place a rubber ring around the base of your penis. This keeps the blood in place and allows you to maintain an erection for around 30 minutes.\nUrinary incontinence\nIf your urinary incontinence\u00a0is mild, you may be able to control it by learning some simple exercises. Pelvic floor exercises can strengthen your control over your bladder.\nTo carry out pelvic floor exercises:\nIf your urinary incontinence is more severe, it may be possible to treat it with surgery. This would involve implanting an artificial sphincter \u2013 a sphincter is a muscle used to control the bladder.\nRead further information:\n\nProstate Cancer UK: sex and prostate cancer\nProstate Cancer UK: urinary problems and prostate cancer\n\nRelationships\nBeing\u00a0diagnosed with prostate cancer often brings families and friends closer, although it can put pressure on relationships too.\nMost people want to help, though they may not know what to do. A few people find it hard to talk to someone with prostate cancer, and may try to avoid them. Being open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help\u00a0may put others at ease. But do not feel shy about telling people that\u00a0you need some time to yourself, if that is what you need.\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan: emotional effects of cancer\nTalking to your kids about cancer\n\nIf you have questions, your doctor or nurse may be able to reassure you, or you may find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor, psychologist or specialist helpline. Your GP practice will have information on these.\nYou may find it helpful to talk to others with prostate cancer at a local support group or through an internet chat room.\nRead further information:\n\nProstate Cancer UK: online community\nProstate Cancer UK: confidential helpline on 0800 074 8383\u00a0to speak to\u00a0a specialist nurse\n\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of your prostate cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially.

In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore.\nPsoriasis affects around 2% of people in the UK. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults under 35 years old. The condition affects men and women equally.\nThe severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some people it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have\u00a0a major impact on their quality of life.\nPsoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or\u00a0mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe.\nRead more about the symptoms of psoriasis.\nWhy it happens\nPeople with psoriasis have an\u00a0increased production of skin cells.\nSkin cells are normally\u00a0made and replaced every 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3\u00a0to 7\u00a0days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis.\nAlthough the process isn't fully understood, it's thought\u00a0to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system\u00a0is your body's defence against disease and infection, but for people with psoriasis, it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake.\nPsoriasis can run in families,\u00a0although the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear.\nMany people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a \"trigger\". Possible triggers of psoriasis include\u00a0an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines.\nThe condition isn't contagious, so it can't be spread from person to person.\nRead more about the\u00a0causes of psoriasis.\nHow psoriasis is diagnosed\nA GP can\u00a0often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin.\nIn rare cases, a small sample of skin, called a biopsy, will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. This determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen planus, lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea.\nYou may be referred to a dermatologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe.\nIf your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specialises in arthritis). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken.\nTreating psoriasis\nThere's no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches.\nIn most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or topical corticosteroids. Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin.\nIf these aren't effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light.\nIn severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body.\nRead more about treating psoriasis.\nLiving with psoriasis\nAlthough psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.\nFor example,\u00a0some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. It's also quite\u00a0common\u00a0to develop\u00a0tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. This is known as psoriatic arthritis.\nSpeak to your GP or healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you\u00a0have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. They\u00a0can offer advice and further treatment if necessary. There are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such as The Psoriasis Association, where you can speak to other people with the condition.\nRead more about living with psoriasis.\nFurther information\nYou can find support and information from organisations like:\n\nChanging Faces - a charity for people who have a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on 0300 012 0275 for counselling and advice\nThe Psoriasis Association - provides support groups for people with psoriasis where you can speak to other people with the condition\n\n\n\nPsoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. Some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness.\nThere are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only\u00a0one\u00a0form of psoriasis at a time, although 2\u00a0different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe.\nMost cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping.\nYou should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis.\nCommon types of psoriasis\nThis is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. They normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. The plaques can be itchy, sore or both. In severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed.\u00a0\nThis can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. It causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. Some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. In extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary.\nIn about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often\u00a0become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble.\nGuttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. There's a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis.\nThis\u00a0type of psoriasis sometimes\u00a0occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers.\nThis affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather.\nPustular psoriasis\nPustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. Different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body.\nThis causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. The pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. During the start of these cycles, von Zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue.\nThis causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. Pustules may reappear every few days or weeks.\nThis causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. The pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. These may lead to painful nail deformities.\nErythrodermic psoriasis\nErythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection, dehydration, heart failure,\u00a0hypothermia and malnutrition.\n\n\nPsoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. It's not known exactly why this happens, but research suggests it's caused by a problem with the immune system.\nYour body produces new skin cells in the deepest layer of skin. These skin cells gradually move up through the layers of skin until they reach the outermost level. Then they die and flake off. This whole process normally takes around 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0weeks.\nIn people with psoriasis, this process only takes about 3\u00a0to 7\u00a0days. As a result, cells that aren't fully mature build up rapidly on the surface of the skin, causing red, flaky, crusty patches covered with silvery scales.\nProblems with the immune system\nYour immune system is your body's defence against disease and it helps fight infection. One of the main types of cell used by the immune system is called a T-cell.\nT-cells normally travel through the body to detect and fight invading germs such as bacteria, but in people with psoriasis they start to attack healthy skin cells by mistake. This causes the deepest layer of skin to produce new skin cells more quickly than usual, which in turn triggers the immune system to produce more T-cells.\nIt's not known what exactly causes this problem with the immune system, although certain genes and environmental triggers may\u00a0play a role.\nGenetics\nPsoriasis runs in families. 1\u00a0in 3\u00a0people with psoriasis has a close relative with the condition.\nHowever, the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. Research studies have shown many different genes are linked to the development of psoriasis. It's likely that different combinations of genes may make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop it.\nPsoriasis triggers\nMany people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger. Knowing your triggers may\u00a0help you to\u00a0avoid a flare-up. Common triggers include:\n\nan injury to your skin, such as a cut, scrape, insect bite or sunburn (this is known as the Koebner response)\ndrinking excessive amounts of alcohol\nsmoking\nstress\nhormonal changes, particularly in women (for example, during\u00a0puberty and the menopause)\ncertain medicines\u00a0such as\u00a0lithium, some antimalarial medicines, anti-inflammatory medicines including ibuprofen, ACE inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure) and\u00a0beta blockers (used to treat congestive heart failure)\nthroat infections \u2013 in some people, usually children and young adults, a form of psoriasis called guttate psoriasis develops after a streptococcal throat infection (although most people who have streptococcal throat infections don't develop psoriasis)\nother immune disorders, such as HIV,\u00a0which cause psoriasis to flare up or to appear for the first time\n\nPsoriasis isn't contagious, so it can't be spread from person to person.\n\n\nTreatment overview\nTreatments are determined by the type and severity of your psoriasis and the area of skin affected. Your\u00a0doctor will probably start with a mild treatment, such as topical creams (which are applied to the skin), and then move on to stronger treatments if necessary.\nA\u00a0wide range of treatments\u00a0are available\u00a0for psoriasis, but identifying which treatment is most effective can be difficult. Talk to your\u00a0doctor if you feel a treatment isn't working or you have uncomfortable side effects.\nTreatments fall into 3\u00a0categories:\n\ntopical \u2013 creams and ointments that\u00a0are applied to your skin\nphototherapy \u2013 your skin is exposed to certain types of ultraviolet\u00a0light\nsystemic\u2013 oral and injected medications that work throughout the entire body\n\nOften, different types of treatment are used in combination.\nYour treatment for psoriasis may need to be reviewed regularly. You may want to make a care plan (an agreement between you and your health professional)\u00a0as this can help you manage your day-to-day health.\nThe various treatments for\u00a0psoriasis are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for psoriasis, allowing you to compare your treatment options.\nTopical treatments\nTopical treatments are usually the first treatments used for mild to moderate\u00a0psoriasis. These are creams and ointments you apply to affected areas.\u00a0\nSome people find that topical treatments\u00a0are all\u00a0they\u00a0need to control their condition, although\u00a0it may take up to 6\u00a0weeks before\u00a0there's a noticeable effect.\nIf you\u00a0have scalp psoriasis, a combination of shampoo and ointment may be recommended.\nEmollients\nEmollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. If you have mild psoriasis, an emollient is probably the first treatment your GP will suggest.\nThe main benefit of emollients is to reduce itching and scaling. Some topical treatments are thought to work better on moisturised skin. It's important to wait at least half an hour before applying a topical treatment after an emollient.\nEmollients are available\u00a0as a wide\u00a0variety of products and can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy\u00a0or prescribed by your GP, nurse or health visitor.\nSteroid creams or ointments\nSteroid creams or ointments (topical corticosteroids)\u00a0are commonly used to treat mild to moderate psoriasis in\u00a0most areas of the body. The treatment works by reducing inflammation. This slows the production of skin cells and reduces itching.\nTopical corticosteroids range in strength from mild to very strong. Only use topical corticosteroids when recommended by your doctor. Stronger topical corticosteroids can be prescribed by your doctor and should only be used on small areas of\u00a0skin or on particularly thick patches. Overusing topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning.\nVitamin D analogues\nVitamin D analogue creams are commonly used along with or instead of\u00a0steroid creams\u00a0for mild to moderate psoriasis affecting areas such as the limbs, trunk or scalp. They work by slowing the production of skin cells. They also have an anti-inflammatory effect.\nExamples of vitamin D analogues are calcipotriol, calcitriol and tacalcitol. There are very few side effects, as long as you don't\u00a0use more than the recommended amount.\nCalcineurin inhibitors\nCalcineurin inhibitors,\u00a0such as\u00a0tacrolimus and pimecrolimus,\u00a0are ointments or creams that reduce the activity of the immune system and help to reduce inflammation. They're sometimes used to treat psoriasis affecting sensitive areas (such as the scalp, the genitals and folds in the skin) if\u00a0steroid creams\u00a0aren't effective.\nThese medications can cause skin irritation or a burning and itching sensation when they're started, but this usually improves within a week.\nCoal tar\nCoal tar is a thick, heavy oil and is probably the oldest treatment for psoriasis. How it works isn't exactly known, but it can reduce scales, inflammation and itchiness. It may be used to treat psoriasis\u00a0affecting the limbs, trunk or scalp if other topical treatments aren't effective.\u00a0\nCoal tar can stain clothes and bedding, and has a strong smell. It can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).\nDithranol\nDithranol has been used for over 50 years to treat psoriasis. It has been shown to be effective in suppressing the production of skin cells and has few side effects. However, it\u00a0can burn if too concentrated.\nIt's typically used as a short-term treatment for psoriasis affecting the limbs or trunk under hospital supervision, as it stains everything it comes into contact with, including skin, clothes and bathroom fittings. It's applied to your skin (while wearing gloves) and left for 10\u00a0to 60 minutes before being washed off.\nDithranol can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below).\nPhototherapy\nPhototherapy uses natural and artificial light to treat psoriasis. Artificial light therapy can be given in hospitals and some specialist centres, usually under the care of a dermatologist. These treatments aren't the same as using a sunbed.\nUVB phototherapy\nUltraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy uses a wavelength of light that is invisible to human eyes. The light slows down the production of skin cells and is an effective treatment for some types of psoriasis that haven't responded to topical treatments. Each session only takes a few minutes, but you may need to go to hospital 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0times a week for 6\u00a0to 8\u00a0weeks.\nPsoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA)\nFor this treatment, you'll first be given a tablet containing compounds called psoralens, or psoralen may be applied directly to the skin. This makes your skin more sensitive to light. Your skin is then exposed to a wavelength of light called ultraviolet A (UVA). This light penetrates your skin more deeply than ultraviolet B light.\nThis treatment may be used if you have severe psoriasis that hasn't responded to other treatment. Side effects of the treatment include nausea, headaches, burning and itchiness. You may need to wear special glasses for 24 hours after taking the tablet to prevent the development of cataracts. Long-term use of this treatment isn't encouraged, as it can increase your risk of developing skin cancer.\nCombination light therapy\nCombining phototherapy with other treatments often increases its effectiveness. Some doctors use UVB phototherapy in combination with coal tar, as the coal tar makes the skin more receptive to light. Combining UVB phototherapy with dithranol cream may also be effective (this is known as Ingram treatment).\nSystemic treatments\nIf your psoriasis is severe\u00a0or other treatments haven't worked, you may be prescribed systemic treatments by a specialist. Systemic treatments are\u00a0treatments that work throughout the entire body.\nThese medications can be very effective in treating psoriasis, but they all have potentially serious side effects. All the systemic treatments for psoriasis have benefits and risks. Before starting treatment, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and any risks associated with them.\nThere are 2\u00a0main types of systemic treatment, called non-biological (usually given as tablets or capsules) and biological (usually given as injections). These are described in more detail below.\nNon-biological medications\nMethotrexate\u00a0can help to control psoriasis by slowing down\u00a0the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It's usually taken once a week.\nMethotrexate can cause nausea and\u00a0may affect the production of blood cells. Long-term use can cause liver damage. People who have liver disease shouldn't take methotrexate, and you shouldn't drink alcohol when taking it.\nMethotrexate can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it's\u00a0important that women use contraception and don't become pregnant while they take this drug and for 3\u00a0months after they stop. Methotrexate can also affect the development of sperm cells, so men shouldn't father a child during treatment and for 3\u00a0weeks afterwards.\nCiclosporin is a medicine that suppresses your immune system (immunosuppressant). It was originally used to prevent transplant rejection, but has proved effective in treating all types of psoriasis. It's usually taken daily.\nCiclosporin increases your chances of kidney disease and high blood pressure, which will need to be monitored.\nAcitretin is an oral retinoid that reduces the production of skin cells. It's used to treat severe psoriasis that hasn't responded to other non-biological systemic treatments. It's usually taken daily.\nAcitretin\u00a0has a wide range of side effects, including dryness and cracking of the lips, dryness of the nasal passages\u00a0and, in rarer cases, hepatitis.\nAcitretin can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it's important that women use contraception and don't become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 2\u00a0years after they stop taking it. However, it's safe for a man taking acitretin\u00a0to father\u00a0a baby.\nBiological treatments\nBiological treatments reduce inflammation by targeting overactive cells in the immune system.\u00a0These treatments are usually used if you\u00a0have severe psoriasis that hasn't responded to other treatments, or if you can't use other treatments.\nEtanercept is injected twice a week and you'll be shown how to do this. If there's no improvement in your psoriasis after 12 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.\nThe main side effect of etanercept is a rash where the injection is given. However, as etanercept affects the whole immune system, there's a risk of serious side effects, including severe infection. If you had\u00a0tuberculosis in the past, there's a risk\u00a0it may return. You'll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.\nAdalimumab is injected once every 2\u00a0weeks and you'll be shown how to do this. If there's no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.\nAdalimumab can be harmful to a developing baby, so it's important that women use contraception and don't become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 5\u00a0months after the treatment finishes.\nThe main side effects of adalimumab include headaches, a rash at the injection site and nausea. However, as adalimumab affects the whole immune system, there's a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You'll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.\nInfliximab is given as a drip (infusion) into your vein at the hospital. You'll have 3\u00a0infusions in the first 6\u00a0weeks, then 1\u00a0infusion every 8\u00a0weeks. If there's no improvement in your psoriasis after 10 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.\nThe main side effect of infliximab is a headache. However, as infliximab affects the whole immune system, there's a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You'll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.\nUstekinumab is injected at the beginning of treatment, then again 4\u00a0weeks later. After this, injections are every 12 weeks. If there's no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped.\nThe main side effects of ustekinumab are a throat infection and a rash at the injection site. However, as ustekinumab affects the whole immune system, there's a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You'll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.\n\n\nAlthough psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected.\nIf you have psoriasis, you may find the following advice helpful.\nSelf care\nSelf care is an\u00a0essential part of your daily life.\u00a0It involves taking responsibility for your own health and wellbeing with support from those involved in your care. Self care includes\u00a0staying fit and maintaining good physical and mental health, preventing illness or accidents, and caring more effectively for minor illnesses and long-term conditions.\nPeople with long-term conditions can benefit enormously from self care. They can live longer, have less pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue,\u00a0a better quality of life, and be more active and independent. Having a care plan will help you manage your treatment so that it fits your lifestyle.\nKeep up your treatment\nIt's important to use your treatment as prescribed, even if your psoriasis improves. Continuous treatment can help to prevent flare-ups. If you have any questions or concerns about your treatment or any side effects, talk to your GP or healthcare team.\nRegular reviews\nBecause psoriasis\u00a0is usually\u00a0a long-term condition, you may be in regular contact with your healthcare team. Discuss your symptoms or concerns with them, as\u00a0the more the team knows, the more\u00a0they can help you.\nHealthy eating and exercise\nPeople with psoriasis\u00a0have a\u00a0slightly higher risk of developing\u00a0diabetes and cardiovascular disease\u00a0than the general population, although\u00a0it's not known why. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are recommended for everyone, not just people with psoriasis, because they can help to prevent many health problems.\nEating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly can also relieve stress, which may improve your psoriasis.\nEmotional impact of psoriasis\nBecause of\u00a0the effect that psoriasis can have on physical appearance, low self-esteem and anxiety are common among people with\u00a0the condition. This can\u00a0lead to\u00a0depression, especially if the psoriasis gets worse.\nYour GP or dermatologist will understand the psychological and emotional impact of\u00a0psoriasis, so talk to them about your concerns or anxieties.\nPsoriatic arthritis\nSome\u00a0people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis. This causes tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue, as well as stiffness. It commonly affects the ends of the fingers and toes. In some people, it affects the lower back, neck and knees. Most people develop psoriatic arthritis after psoriasis,\u00a0but about\u00a020%\u00a0develop it\u00a0before they're diagnosed with psoriasis.\nThere's no single test for psoriatic arthritis. It's normally diagnosed using a combination of methods, including\u00a0looking at your medical history, physical examinations, blood tests, X-rays and MRI scans. If you have psoriasis, you'll usually have an annual assessment to look for signs of psoriatic arthritis.\nIf\u00a0your doctor\u00a0thinks you have psoriatic arthritis, you'll usually be referred to a specialist called a rheumatologist, so you can be treated with anti-inflammatory or anti-rheumatic medicines.\nPregnancy\nPsoriasis doesn't affect fertility, and women with psoriasis can have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. Some women find their psoriasis improves during pregnancy,\u00a0but for others\u00a0it gets worse.\nTalk to your healthcare team if you're thinking of having a baby. Some treatments for psoriasis can be harmful to a developing baby, so use contraception while taking them.\u00a0This can apply to both men and women, depending on the medication. Your healthcare team can suggest the best\u00a0ways to\u00a0control your psoriasis before you start trying for a family.\nTalk to others\nMany people with psoriasis have found that getting involved in support groups helps them. Support groups can increase your self-confidence, reduce\u00a0feelings of isolation,\u00a0and give you\u00a0practical advice about living with the condition.\nFurther information and support for psoriasis is available from the charity Changing Faces.\n\u00a0\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. This might involve hallucinations or delusions.\nThe two main\u00a0symptoms of psychosis are:\n\nhallucinations\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren't there; a common hallucination is hearing voices\ndelusions \u2013\u00a0where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example,\u00a0thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you\n\nThe combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour.\nExperiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode.\nWhat causes psychosis?\nPsychosis isn't a condition in itself\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it's triggered by\u00a0other conditions.\nIt's\u00a0sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as:\n\nschizophrenia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions\nbipolar disorder\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a mental health condition that affects mood; a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes of\u00a0depression\u00a0(lows) and mania (highs)\nsevere depression \u2013\u00a0some people with depression also have symptoms of psychosis when they're very depressed\n\nPsychosis can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, or physical conditions, such as\u00a0Parkinson's disease, a brain tumour, or as\u00a0a result of\u00a0drug\u00a0misuse or alcohol misuse.\nHow often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause.\nFor example, schizophrenia can be long term, but most people can make a good recovery and about a quarter only have a single psychotic episode. Episodes related to bipolar disorder usually resolve, but may recur.\nRead more about the causes of psychosis.\nDiagnosing psychosis\nYou should see your GP immediately if you're experiencing psychotic episodes. It's important psychosis is treated as soon as possible as early treatment usually has better long-term outcomes.\nYour GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse. They may ask you some questions to help determine what's causing your psychosis. For example, they may ask you:\n\nwhether you're taking any medication\nwhether you've been taking illegal substances\nhow your mood has been\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you've been depressed\nhow you've been functioning day-to-day\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you're still working\nwhether you have a family history of mental health conditions\u00a0\u2013 such as schizophrenia\nabout your hallucinations\u00a0\u2013 such as whether you've heard voices\nabout your delusions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as whether you feel people are controlling you\nwhether you have any other symptoms\n\nYour GP should refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing psychosis.\nTreating psychosis\nTreatment for psychosis involves using a combination of:\n\nantipsychotic medication \u2013\u00a0which can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis\npsychological therapies \u2013\u00a0the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0has proved successful in helping people with schizophrenia;\u00a0in appropriate cases, family therapy has been shown to reduce the need for hospital treatment in people with psychosis\nsocial support \u2013\u00a0support with social needs, such as education, employment, or accommodation\n\nMost people with psychosis who get better with medication need to continue taking it for at least a year. Some people need to take medication long term to prevent symptoms recurring.\nIf a person's psychotic episodes are severe, they may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.\nRead more about the treatment of psychosis.\nGetting help for others\nPeople with psychosis often have a lack of insight. They're unaware that they're thinking and acting strangely.\nBecause of\u00a0their lack of insight,\u00a0it's often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them.\nIf you're concerned about someone you know and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they've previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. If you think the person's symptoms are placing them at possible risk of harm, you can:\n\ntake them to the nearest\u00a0accident and emergency (A&E) department, if they agree\ncall their GP or\u00a0local out-of-hours GP\ncall 999 and ask for an ambulance\n\nComplications\nPeople with a history of psychosis are much more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both.\nThis may be because these\u00a0substances can provide short-term symptom relief, although they usually make symptoms worse in the long term.\nPeople with psychosis also have a higher than average risk of\u00a0suicide. It's estimated\u00a01 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt to commit suicide at some point in their life, and\u00a01 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves.\nSide effects can also occur if someone is\u00a0taking antipsychotics on a long-term basis. Weight gain is a common side effect. In rare cases,\u00a0a person with psychosis may\u00a0also develop type 2 diabetes.\nRead more about the complications of psychosis.\n\n\nSomeone who develops psychosis will have their own unique set of symptoms and experiences, according to their particular circumstances.\nHowever, four main symptoms\u00a0are associated with a psychotic episode. They are:\n\nhallucinations\ndelusions\nconfused and disturbed thoughts\nlack of insight and self-awareness\n\nThese are outlined in more detail below.\nHallucinations\nHallucinations\u00a0are where a person perceives something that doesn't exist in reality. They can occur in all five of the senses:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nsight \u2013\u00a0someone with psychosis may see colours and shapes, or people or animals that aren't there\nsounds \u2013\u00a0someone with psychosis may hear voices that are angry, unpleasant or sarcastic\ntouch \u2013\u00a0a common psychotic hallucination is that you are being touched when there is nobody there\nsmell \u2013\u00a0usually a strange or unpleasant odour\ntaste \u2013 some people with psychosis have complained of having a constant unpleasant taste in their mouth\n\nDelusions\nA delusion is where a person has an unshakeable belief in something implausible, bizarre, or obviously untrue. Paranoid delusion and delusions of grandeur are two examples of psychotic delusions.\nA person with psychosis will often believe an individual or organisation is making plans to hurt or kill them. This can lead to unusual behaviour. For example, a person with psychosis may refuse to be in the same room as a mobile phone because they believe they are mind control devices.\nSomeone with psychosis may also have delusions of grandeur. This is where they believe they have some imaginary power or authority. For example, they may think they're the president of a country or they have the power to bring people back from the dead.\nConfused and disturbed thoughts\nPeople with psychosis often have disturbed, confused, and disrupted patterns of thought. Signs of this include:\n\nrapid and constant speech\nrandom speech\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, they may switch from one topic to another mid-sentence\na sudden loss\u00a0in their train of thought, resulting in an abrupt pause in conversation or activity\n\nLack of insight\nPeople who have psychotic episodes are often totally unaware their behaviour is in any way strange or that their delusions or hallucinations are not real.\nThey may recognise delusional or bizarre behaviour in others, but lack the self-awareness to recognise it in themselves.\nFor example, a person with psychosis being treated in a psychiatric ward may complain that their fellow patients are mentally unwell, while they're perfectly normal.\nPostnatal psychosis\nPostnatal psychosis, also called puerperal psychosis, is a severe form of\u00a0postnatal depression, a type of depression some women experience after having a baby.\nIt's estimated postnatal psychosis affects around 1 in every 1,000 women who give birth. It most commonly occurs during the first\u00a0few weeks\u00a0after having a baby.\nPostnatal psychosis is more likely\u00a0to affect women who already have a mental health condition, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.\u00a0\nAs well as the symptoms of psychosis, symptoms of postnatal psychosis can also include:\n\na high mood (mania)\u00a0\u2013 for example, talking and thinking\u00a0too much or too quickly\na low mood\u00a0\u2013 for example, depression, lack of energy,\u00a0loss of\u00a0appetite, and trouble sleeping\n\nPostnatal psychosis is regarded as a medical emergency. Contact your GP immediately if you think someone you know may have developed postnatal psychosis. If this isn't possible, call the\u00a0NHS 24 '111' service\u00a0or your local\u00a0out-of-hours service.\nIf you think there's an imminent danger of\u00a0harm, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.\n\n\nThe causes of psychosis have three main classifications.\nThey are psychosis caused by:\n\nmental (psychological)\u00a0conditions\ngeneral medical conditions\nsubstances, such as alcohol or drugs\n\nThe three classifications are described in more detail below.\nPsychological causes\nThe following conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people:\n\nschizophrenia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a long-term (chronic) mental health condition that causes hallucinations and delusions\nbipolar disorder\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that affects a person's moods, which can swing from one extreme to another (highs and lows)\nsevere stress\u00a0or anxiety\nsevere depression\u00a0\u2013\u00a0feelings of persistent sadness that last for more\u00a0than six weeks, including\u00a0postnatal depression,\u00a0which some women experience after having a baby\nlack of sleep\n\nThe underlying psychological cause will often influence the type of psychotic episode someone experiences.\nFor example, a person with bipolar disorder is more likely to have delusions of grandeur, whereas someone with depression or schizophrenia is more likely to develop paranoid delusions.\nGeneral medical conditions\nThe following medical conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people:\n\nHIV and AIDS\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a virus that attacks the body's natural defence against illness and infection (the immune system)\nmalaria\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a tropical disease spread by infected mosquitoes\nsyphilis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a bacterial infection usually passed on through sexual contact\nAlzheimer's disease\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the most common form of\u00a0dementia, which causes a decline in mental abilities like memory and reasoning\nParkinson's disease\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a long-term condition that affects the way the brain co-ordinates body movements, including walking, talking, and writing\nhypoglycaemia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an abnormally low level of sugar (glucose) in the blood\nlupus\u00a0\u2013 a condition where the immune system attacks healthy tissue\nLyme disease\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks\nmultiple sclerosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that affects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, causing problems with muscle movement, balance, and vision\u00a0\nbrain tumour\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a growth of cells in the brain that multiply in an abnormal and uncontrollable way\n\nSubstances\nAlcohol misuse\u00a0and\u00a0drug misuse can trigger a psychotic episode.\nA person can also experience a psychotic episode if they suddenly stop drinking\u00a0alcohol or\u00a0taking drugs after using them for a long time. This is known as withdrawal.\nIt's also possible to experience psychosis after drinking large amounts of alcohol or if you're high on drugs.\nDrugs known to trigger psychotic episodes include:\n\ncocaine\namphetamine (speed)\nmethamphetamine (crystal meth)\nmephedrone (MCAT or miaow)\nMDMA (ecstasy)\ncannabis\nLSD (acid)\npsilocybins (magic mushrooms)\nketamine\n\nIn rare situations, psychosis can also occur as a side effect of some types of medication or as a result of an overdose of that medication.\nFor example, levodopa, a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, can sometimes cause psychotic episodes. However, any medicine that acts on the brain can cause psychosis with an overdose.\nNever stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional\u00a0responsible for your care.\nSee your GP if you're experiencing psychotic side effects\u00a0caused by\u00a0medication.\nThe brain\nThere's been a great deal of research into how psychosis affects the brain and how changes in the brain can trigger symptoms of psychosis.\nResearch has revealed several physical and biological changes occur in the brain\u00a0during a psychotic episode. Grey matter is the part of the brain responsible for processing thoughts.\nThe results of\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans have shown some people with a history of psychosis have less grey matter than most other people. However, it's not yet fully understood why this is.\nResearchers also believe dopamine plays an important role in psychosis.\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter,\u00a0one of many chemicals the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another.\u00a0It is associated with how we feel whether something is significant, important, or interesting.\nIt's thought\u00a0levels of dopamine in the brain become too high\u00a0in people with psychosis. The excess dopamine interrupts specific pathways in the brain that are responsible for some of its most important functions, such as:\n\nmemory\nemotion\nsocial behaviour\nself-awareness\n\nDisruption to these important brain functions may explain the symptoms of psychosis.\nEvidence for the role of dopamine in psychosis comes from several sources, including brain scans and\u00a0the fact medications\u00a0known to reduce the effects of dopamine in the brain also reduce the\u00a0symptoms of psychosis.\nHowever, illegal drugs\u00a0known to increase\u00a0levels of dopamine in the brain\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines\u00a0\u2013\u00a0can trigger psychosis.\n\n\nYou should visit your GP if you're experiencing psychotic episodes.\nIt's important to speak to your GP as soon as possible as the early treatment of psychosis usually has better long-term outcomes.\u00a0\nInitial assessment\nThere's no test to positively diagnose psychosis. However, your GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse.\nYour GP may ask questions to determine the cause of your psychosis. For example, they may ask\u00a0you:\n\nwhether you're taking any medication\nwhether you've been taking\u00a0illegal substances\nhow your moods have been\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you've been depressed\u00a0\nhow you've been functioning day-to-day\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you're still working\nwhether you have a family history of mental health conditions, such as\u00a0schizophrenia\nabout the details of your hallucinations, such as whether you've heard voices\nabout the details of your delusions, such as whether you feel people are controlling you\nabout any other symptoms you have\n\nReferral\nThe evidence supporting the early treatment of psychosis means you're likely to be referred to a specialist urgently. This will either be during or after your first episode of psychosis.\nWho you're referred to will depend on the services available in your area. You may be referred to:\n\na community mental health team \u2013\u00a0a team of different mental health professionals who provide support to people with complex mental health conditions\na crisis resolution team \u2013\u00a0a team of different mental health professionals who treat people currently experiencing a psychotic episode who would otherwise require hospitalisation\nan early intervention team \u2013\u00a0a team of mental health professionals who work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis\n\nThese teams are likely to include some or all of the following healthcare professionals:\n\na psychologist \u2013\u00a0a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions\na psychiatrist \u2013\u00a0a qualified medical doctor who has received further training in treating mental health conditions\na community mental health nurse \u2013\u00a0a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions\n\nYour psychiatrist will carry out a full assessment to help identify and diagnose any underlying mental health condition that could be causing your symptoms. This will help\u00a0when planning your treatment for psychosis.\nHelping others\nThe lack of insight associated with psychosis means people experiencing\u00a0it aren't always able to recognise their strange behaviour.\nThey may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there's nothing wrong with them, and you may need to get help for them.\nSomeone who has had psychotic episodes in the past may have been assigned a mental health worker, who works in social services,\u00a0so try to contact them to express your concerns.\nSomeone who is having a psychotic episode for the first time may need a friend, relative or someone else close to them to persuade them to visit their GP.\nIf they're having a psychotic episode that's rapidly getting worse, you should contact their crisis team or,\u00a0if the team isn't available,\u00a0the duty psychiatrist at their nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.\nIf a person who is having a psychotic episode refuses to seek help and\u00a0is believed to present a risk to themselves or others, their nearest relative can request a psychological assessment. Your\u00a0local mental health trust can advise you about this.\nIf someone has very severe psychosis, they can be compulsorily detained at hospital for assessment and treatment\u00a0under the\u00a0Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015.\n\n\nTreatment for psychosis involves a combination of antipsychotic medicines, psychological therapies, and social support.\nYour care team\nYour treatment is likely to be co-ordinated by a team of mental health professionals working together. If this is your first psychotic episode, you may be referred to an early intervention team.\nAn early intervention team is a\u00a0team of healthcare professionals set up specifically to work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis.\nSome early intervention teams only focus on a certain age range, such as people who are 14 to 35 years old.\nDepending on your care needs, early intervention teams aim to provide:\n\na full assessment of your symptoms\nprescriptions for medications\npsychological services\nsocial, occupational, and educational interventions\n\nTreatment for psychosis will vary, depending on the underlying cause. You'll receive specific treatment if you've been diagnosed with an underlying mental health condition as well.\nFor example, treatment for bipolar disorder\u00a0uses a variety of medications, which could include antipsychotics to treat symptoms of mania, lithium and anticonvulsants to help stabilise mood, as well as psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nTreatment for schizophrenia usually involves a combination of antipsychotic medication and social support. CBT or another type of psychotherapy\u00a0called family therapy\u00a0are also often used.\u00a0\nPsychosis related to drug or alcohol intoxication or withdrawal may only require a short course of antipsychotics or tranquillisers, which have a calming effect. Referral to an addiction counsellor may then be recommended.\nAntipsychotics\nAntipsychotic medicines, also known as neuroleptics, are usually recommended as the first treatment for psychosis. They\u00a0work by blocking the effect of dopamine, a chemical that transmits messages in the brain.\nHowever, they're not suitable or effective for everyone, as side effects can affect people differently. In particular, antipsychotics will be monitored closely in people who also have epilepsy, a condition that causes seizures or fits.\nPeople who have cardiovascular disease\u00a0\u2013 conditions that affect the heart, blood vessels, or circulation, such as heart disease\u00a0\u2013 will also be closely monitored.\nAntipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but they may take several days or weeks to reduce other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.\nAntipsychotics can be taken by mouth (orally) or given as an injection. There are several slow-release antipsychotics, where you only need one injection every two to six weeks.\nDepending on the underlying cause of your psychosis, you may only need to take antipsychotics until your psychosis subsides.\nHowever, if you have a condition like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, you may need to take antipsychotics on a long-term basis to prevent further episodes of psychosis.\nAntipsychotics can have side effects, although not everyone will experience them and their severity will differ from person to person.\nSide effects\u00a0can include:\n\ndrowsiness\u00a0\u2013 this may affect your ability to drive\u00a0\nshaking and trembling\nrestlessness\nmuscle twitches and spasms\u00a0\u2013 where your muscles shorten tightly and painfully\nblurred vision\ndizziness\u00a0\nconstipation\nloss of sex drive (libido)\ndry mouth\u00a0\n\nSee the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects. In addition,\u00a0long-term use of antipsychotics can lead to complications\u00a0like\u00a0weight gain and diabetes.\nRead more about\u00a0the\u00a0complications\u00a0of psychosis.\nTell your GP if you have\u00a0side effects that are becoming particularly troublesome. There may be an alternative antipsychotic medicine you can take.\nNever stop taking medication prescribed for you unless\u00a0advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional\u00a0responsible for your care.\nSuddenly stopping prescription medication could trigger a return\u00a0of your symptoms (relapse). When it's time for you to stop taking your medication, it will be done gradually and under close observation.\u00a0\nPsychological treatment\nPsychological treatment can help reduce the intensity and anxiety caused by psychosis. Some possible psychological treatments are discussed below.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis is based on an understanding of how people make sense of their experiences and why some people become distressed by them.\nThe aim of CBT is to identify unhelpful thinking patterns and emotions that may be causing your unwanted feelings and behaviours. It's then possible to learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and balanced thoughts.\nA CBT therapist may encourage you to consider different ways of understanding what's happening to you. The aim is to help you achieve goals that are meaningful and important to you, such as reducing your distress, returning to work or university, or regaining a sense of control.\nFamily therapy is known to be an effective form of treatment for people with psychosis. It's a way of helping both you and your family cope with your condition.\nAfter having an episode of psychosis, you may rely on your family members for\u00a0care and support. While most family members are happy to help, the stress of caring for somebody can place a strain on any family.\nFamily therapy involves a series of informal meetings that take place over a period of six months. Meetings may include:\n\ndiscussing your condition\u00a0and how it might progress, plus the available treatments\u00a0\u00a0\nexploring ways of supporting someone with psychosis\u00a0\ndeciding how to solve practical problems caused by psychosis, such as\u00a0planning how to manage future psychotic episodes\u00a0\n\nIf you're experiencing episodes of psychosis, you may benefit from being around other people who've had similar experiences.\n\n\nSomeone experiencing a psychotic episode may self-harm. Suicidal thoughts and an increased risk of suicide are also common.\nSelf-harm\nSelf-harming behaviour is a relatively common complication in people with psychosis. A study found 1 in 10 people with psychosis also had a history of self-harm.\nThe risk of self-harm is thought to be highest in people who are experiencing their first episode of psychosis but\u00a0aren't receiving treatment.\nSee your GP\u00a0if you're self-harming. You can also call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 for support.\nIf you think a friend or relative is self-harming, look out for signs of unexplained cuts, bruises or cigarette burns, usually on the wrists, arms, thighs, and chest. People who self-harm may keep themselves covered up\u00a0at all times, even in hot weather.\u00a0\nA person\u00a0who's self-harming may feel deep shame and guilt, or they may feel confused and worried by their own behaviour. It's important to approach them with care and understanding.\nThey may not want to discuss their self-harming behaviour\u00a0with you, but you could suggest they speak to\u00a0their GP or\u00a0a counsellor on\u00a0a support helpline.\nSuicide\nPeople with psychosis also have an increased risk of suicide. It's estimated 1 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt suicide at some point in their life, and 1 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves.\nIf you're feeling suicidal, you can:\n\ncall\u00a0the\u00a0Samaritans support service on 08457 90 90 90\ngo to\u00a0your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department and tell the staff how you're feeling\ncontact\u00a0the NHS 24 '111' service\nspeak to\u00a0a friend, family member, or someone you trust\nmake an urgent appointment to see your GP,\u00a0psychiatrist, or care team\n\nRead more about getting help\u00a0if you're feeling suicidal.\nIf you're worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, recommend that they contact one or more of the organisations above and encourage them, in a non-judgemental way, to talk about how they're feeling.\nIf the person has previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression, you can speak to a member of their care team for help and advice.\nRead more about the\u00a0warning signs of suicide and supporting someone who's feeling\u00a0suicidal.\nAntipsychotics\nUsing antipsychotics on a medium- to long-term basis can cause a number of complications. Some of the more common\u00a0complications are discussed below.\nWeight gain is a complication of many commonly used antipsychotics. There are two main reasons why weight gain is thought to occur.\nAntipsychotics can:\n\nlead to an increase in appetite\nmake you less active\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou'll probably be advised to take more exercise to\u00a0help burn off the excess fat.\nRead about\u00a0getting started with exercise and how to lose weight safely.\nMetabolic syndrome is a term describing a number of related conditions linked to weight gain, such as:\n\nhigh blood sugar (hyperglycaemia)\u00a0\nhigh cholesterol \nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nobesity\u00a0\n\nThese health conditions can also increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and, most seriously, heart attack or stroke.\nBecause of\u00a0the risk of metabolic syndrome, you'll usually need to have\u00a0regular\u00a0blood tests and blood pressure tests while taking antipsychotics.\nIf your test results\u00a0show you have an increased risk of developing a condition such as heart disease, a number of preventative treatments, such as statins,\u00a0are available to help lower cholesterol levels.\nTardive dyskinesia (TD) is another common complication of long-term antipsychotic use.\nTD is a movement disorder where a person experiences involuntary movements, such as twitching, tics, grimaces, tremors, and spasms. It usually starts in the face and mouth before spreading to the rest of the body.\nIn some cases, stopping taking an antipsychotic will provide relief from TD symptoms, but in other cases it makes the symptoms worse.\nHowever, stopping medication isn't always safe and\u00a0has\u00a0to\u00a0be balanced against the risk of having a relapse.\nIn some cases, TD can be a permanent condition.\nThere are also a number of treatments that can sometimes improve the\u00a0symptoms of TD, including:\n\nclonazepam \u2013\u00a0a medication used to treat\u00a0epilepsy, a condition that affects the brain and causes seizures or fits\nvitamin E supplements \u2013\u00a0check with the doctor in charge of your care before taking vitamin supplements\u00a0as they're not safe or suitable for everyone\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body \u2013 usually the fingers and toes.\nIt's often referred to as Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, Raynaud\u2019s\u00a0disease or just Raynaud's.\nWhy does it happen?\nRaynaud\u2019s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood.\nThis causes the affected area to change colour to white, then blue and then red, as the bloodflow returns.\u00a0You may also experience numbness, pain, and pins and needles.\nSymptoms of Raynaud's can last\u00a0from a few minutes to several hours.\nIt's not\u00a0a serious threat to your health, but can be painful and difficult to live with. If can affect your ability to move your fingers and hands.\u00a0People with Raynaud\u2019s often go for long periods without any symptoms, and sometimes the condition goes away altogether.\nOther parts of the body that can be affected by Raynaud\u2019s include the ears, nose, nipples and lips.\nTreating Raynaud's\nIn many cases, it may be possible to control the symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s yourself by avoiding the cold, wearing gloves and using relaxation techniques when feeling stressed.\nStopping smoking can also improve symptoms, as smoking can affect your circulation.\nIf you're unable to control your symptoms yourself, then a medication called nifedipine may be recommended.\nRead more about treating Raynaud\u2019s.\nTypes of Raynaud's\nThere are two types of Raynaud's:\n\nprimary \u2013 when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type)\nsecondary \u2013 when it's caused by\u00a0another health condition\n\nMost cases of secondary Raynaud\u2019s are associated with conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue (autoimmune conditions), such as scleroderma\u00a0and lupus.\nThe causes of primary Raynaud\u2019s\u00a0are unclear. However\u00a01 in 10 people with primary Raynaud\u2019s goes on to develop a condition associated with secondary Raynaud\u2019s, such as lupus.\nYour GP can help to determine whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud's\u00a0by examining your symptoms and carrying out blood tests.\nRead more about what causes Raynaud\u2019s\u00a0and diagnosing Raynaud's.\nPossible complications\nSecondary Raynaud\u2019s can severely restrict the\u00a0blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even\u00a0tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. However, severe complications are rare.\nRead more about the complications of Raynaud\u2019s.\nWho gets Raynaud\u2019s?\nRaynaud\u2019s phenomenon is a common condition. It affects up to 20% of the adult population worldwide. There may be as many as 10 million people with the condition in the UK.\nPrimary Raynaud\u2019s usually begins in your 20s or 30s. Secondary Raynaud\u2019s can develop at any age, depending on the cause.\nRaynaud's is slightly more common in women than men.\n\n\nRaynaud's phenomenon is the result of over-sensitive blood vessels in the body's extremities. In many cases, no cause is identified, although it's sometimes linked to other health conditions.\nWhen your body is exposed to cold temperatures, the extremities, such as your fingers and toes, lose heat. This is because the small blood vessels under the skin spasm, slowing down the blood supply that is helping to preserve your body's core temperature.\nIn people with Raynaud's, the sensitive blood vessels overreact to cold temperatures and become narrower than usual, significantly restricting the blood flow.\nSymptoms can be triggered by mildly cool weather, getting something out of the freezer, or running your hands under a cold tap. Strong emotions such as\u00a0stress or anxiety may also trigger symptoms.\nPrimary Raynaud\u2019s\nThe most common form of Raynaud's is primary Raynaud's phenomenon. This means the condition occurs by itself, without being associated with another health condition.\nIt seems that\u00a0primary Raynaud\u2019s is caused by disruptions in how the nervous system controls blood vessels. Exactly what causes these disruptions is unclear.\nThere's some evidence that primary Raynaud\u2019s may be an inherited condition, as cases have been known to run in families.\nSecondary Raynaud's\nIn some cases, an underlying\u00a0health condition could\u00a0be causing the blood vessels to overreact. This is called secondary Raynaud's.\nThe majority of cases of secondary Raynaud\u2019s are associated with autoimmune conditions, which cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue.\nAutoimmune conditions known to be associated with secondary Raynaud\u2019s include:\n\nscleroderma \u2013 a condition that causes hardening and thickening of the skin\nrheumatoid arthritis \u2013 which causes joint pain and swelling\nSjogren's syndrome \u2013 where the immune system attacks the body\u2019s sweat and tear glands\nlupus \u2013 which causes tiredness, joint pain and skin rashes\n\nAround\u00a01 in 10 people with primary Raynaud\u2019s go on to develop an autoimmune condition.\nBlood-born viral infections, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, can occasionally trigger Raynaud\u2019s in some people.\nSome types of cancer can cause secondary Raynaud\u2019s. These are\u00a0usually cancers that develop inside the blood, bone marrow or immune system, such as:\n\nacute lymphoblastic leukaemia \u2013 a cancer of the white blood cells that mainly affects children\nlymphoma \u2013 a cancer that develops inside one or more of the glands that are part of the immune system\nmultiple myeloma \u2013 a cancer that develops inside bone marrow\n\nSecondary Raynaud's can also be a side effect of taking certain medicines, including:\n\nsome types of anti-migraine medication \u2013 such as sumatriptan and ergotamine\nbeta-blockers \u2013 which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease\nsome chemotherapy medicines\ndecongestants\u00a0\nthe contraceptive pill \nmedicines used in\u00a0hormone replacement therapy\nsome types of medicines used\u00a0to treat\u00a0high blood pressure\u00a0\n\nIllegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can also cause secondary Raynaud\u2019s.\nRaynaud's sometimes results from a physical injury. It can also affect musicians, people who type a lot, or other people who use their fingers and hands more than usual.\nSkin and tissue damage caused by\u00a0frostbite can also lead to Raynaud's.\nSmoking cigarettes also increases your risk of developing Raynaud's. Read\u00a0about the support available to help you quit smoking.\nVibration white finger\nVibration white finger is a term used when secondary Raynaud's has been caused by vibration. This typically happens to people who regularly use certain types of vibrating tools, such as:\u00a0\n\nsanders, grinders and disc cutters\nhammer drills\nchainsaws, hedge trimmers and power mowers\n\nAny vibrating tool that causes tingling or numbness in your fingers could lead to vibration white finger.\nYour employer has a responsibility to protect you from vibration white finger. If the job can't be done without vibrating tools:\n\nask to use suitable low-vibration tools\nmake sure you're using the right tool for the job\ncheck tools are properly maintained\nkeep\u00a0cutting tools sharp\nreduce the amount of time you use the tool in one go by doing other jobs in between\nkeep warm at work\nwear anti-vibration gloves\nstore tools\u00a0indoors, so they don't have cold handles when next used\nencourage your blood circulation by keeping warm, stopping smoking and massaging and exercising your fingers during your breaks\n\nIf you're diagnosed with the condition, tell your employer as soon as possible. If you stop using vibrating tools at an early stage, you may recover fully.\nBy law, your employer must contact the Health and Safety Executive about your condition. You may be entitled to an Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, which is a payment given to people who have become ill or injured as a result of their work.\nSee the GOV.UK website for more information about the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.\n\n\nRaynaud's phenomenon can usually be diagnosed after an examination of your symptoms and some blood tests.\nYour GP may place your hands in cold water or cool air to see if you show symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s.\nFurther testing is usually recommended to find out whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud\u2019s.\nSecondary Raynaud\u2019s may require more treatment and, in some cases, referral to a specialist.\nSecondary Raynaud\u2019s may be suspected if:\n\nyour symptoms only started when you were over 30 years of age \u2013 most cases of primary Raynaud\u2019s begin between the ages of 20 to 30\nyou're experiencing severe pain during an attack of Raynaud\u2019s\nonly one side of your body is affected\n\nYour GP may also check the tiny blood vessels, known as capillaries, found where your nail meets the finger. These capillaries are often\u00a0larger in people with secondary Raynaud\u2019s, and look like red pen marks.\nBlood tests\nYour GP may also refer you for blood tests to check for other health conditions\u00a0that could be causing your symptoms. These tests may include:\n\na full blood count \u2013\u00a0to check for\u00a0infection or, much less commonly, a cancer of the blood, such as leukaemia\nan antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test \u2013\u00a0to\u00a0check for an\u00a0overactive immune system, which is common in people with autoimmune conditions such as scleroderma\u00a0and lupus\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate \u2013\u00a0to check for an autoimmune disorder\n\nScleroderma & Raynaud's UK (SRUK)\nIf you've been diagnosed with Raynaud\u2019s, Scleroderma & Raynaud's UK (SRUK) may be helpful.\nIt is the UK\u2019s leading charity for people affected by the condition.\n\n\nYou can usually treat Raynaud's phenomenon yourself, although medication is sometimes necessary.\nIf you've been diagnosed with secondary Raynaud\u2019s, you may be referred to a specialist in the treatment of the underlying condition.\nIf your secondary Raynaud\u2019s may be a side effect of a medication, you may be asked to stop taking it, to see if your symptoms improve.\nSelf-help\nThe following advice is recommended for\u00a0both primary and secondary Raynaud\u2019s.\n\nKeep your whole body warm, especially your hands and feet. Wear gloves and warm footwear in cold weather.\nIf you smoke, stop. Quitting smoking will improve your circulation, which should help to improve symptoms.\nExercise regularly, as this helps to improve your circulation and reduce stress levels (see below). For most people, 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week is recommended. Read more about exercise.\nTry to minimise your stress levels. Regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and\u00a0relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or activities such as yoga, can help. You may find it useful to avoid stimulants such as coffee, tea and cola.\n\nIf you find it difficult to control feelings of stress, you may require additional treatment, such as counselling. Read more about therapies for stress.\nMedication\nIf your symptoms fail to improve, you may be prescribed nifedipine. This is the only medicine licensed to treat Raynaud's phenomenon in the UK. It doesn't cure Raynaud's, but can help to relieve the symptoms.\nNifedipine is a calcium channel blocker \u2013 a type of medication that encourages the blood vessels to widen.\nDepending on the pattern of your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment, you may be asked to take your medication every day. Alternatively, you may only need to take it as prevention; for example, during\u00a0a sudden snap of cold weather.\nSide effects are common and include:\n\noedema \u2013 swelling of certain parts of the body, such as your hands and feet, due to a build-up of fluid\nheadaches\nheart palpitations\ndizziness\nconstipation\n\nDon't drink grapefruit juice when taking nifedipine, as this could make side effects worse.\nThe side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine, but tell your GP if you find them particularly troublesome. There are alternative calcium channel blockers that may suit you better.\nOther medications have been used to treat Raynaud\u2019s, but their use is controversial, as there is limited evidence to show they're effective in most people. However, some people have claimed to benefit from treatment. These medications include:\n\nfluoxetine \u2013 which was widely used in the treatment of depression\nsildenafil \u2013 which is used to treat erectile dysfunction (inability to get or maintain an erection)\n\nThese medicines are not licensed for the treatment of Raynaud's in the UK, but you may be prescribed them if it's thought the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks.\u00a0\nSurgery\nSurgery for Raynaud's is rare. It's usually only recommended if your symptoms are so severe that there's a risk the affected body part, such as your fingers, could lose their blood supply and begin to die. Read more about the complications of Raynaud's phenomenon.\nA type of surgery called sympathectomy is sometimes used. It involves cutting the nerves causing the affected blood vessels to spasm.\nThe results of a sympathectomy are often only temporary and further treatment and possibly more surgery may be required after a few years.\n\n\nPeople with Raynaud's phenomenon have an increased risk of developing other problems, such as scleroderma.\nScleroderma\nAround\u00a01 in 16 women and\u00a01 in 50 men with Raynaud\u2019s develop a condition called scleroderma, usually between the ages of 25 and 55.\nScleroderma is when the body produces excessively high levels of collagen.\nScleroderma is a Greek word meaning hard skin, but it can affect other areas of the body, such as the kidneys, heart and lungs.\nSymptoms of scleroderma include:\n\npuffy and itchy skin\ntight and uncomfortable joints\nsmall calcium spots and red spots under the skin\ntrouble swallowing, known as dysphagia\ndiarrhoea, bloating or constipation\n\nThere's no cure for scleroderma, but there are ways of overcoming problems it may cause.\nFor example, medicines can reverse or slow down the processes that cause damage around the body.\nFor more information, visit Scleroderma & Raynaud's UK (SRUK), a UK charity dedicated to improving the lives of people affected by Scleroderma and Raynaud\u2019s.\nUlcers and gangrene\nIn severe cases of Raynaud\u2019s, the blood supply to an affected body part can become severely diminished. Without a constant supply of blood, the tissue in the body part will begin to die. This problem is rare and normally only occurs in secondary Raynaud's.\nThe initial sign is an open sore, known as an ulcer, which develops on the surface of the body part. If you suspect a skin ulcer, contact your GP for advice.\nLeft untreated, the tissue can die, which is known as gangrene (specifically, dry gangrene).\nThe symptoms of dry gangrene normally begin with a red line on the skin that marks the edges of the affected tissue. The tissue becomes cold and numb, and can be painful as the tissue dies. However, many people, particularly the elderly, experience no sensations.\nThe affected area changes colour from red, to brown, to black. The dead tissue will then shrivel up, separate from the healthy tissue and fall off.\nThese complications normally require admission to hospital, where you'll be given medication designed to thin your blood, which should help to restore blood flow.\nIf you fail to respond to treatment, you may need surgery to unblock or repair damaged blood vessels.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Reactive arthritis, formerly known as Reiter's syndrome, is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) in various places in the body.\nIt usually develops following an infection, and in most cases clears up in a few months without\u00a0causing long-term problems.\nThe three most common places\u00a0affected by reactive arthritis\u00a0are:\n\nthe joints (arthritis), which can cause\u00a0pain, stiffness and swelling\nthe eyes (conjunctivitis), which can cause\u00a0eye pain and redness\nthe urethra\u00a0(non-gonococcal urethritis), which can cause pain when urinating (the urethra\u00a0is the tube that carries urine out of the body)\u00a0\n\nHowever,\u00a0most people will not experience all of these problems.\u00a0\nRead more about the symptoms of reactive arthritis.\nWhat causes reactive arthritis?\nReactive arthritis usually develops within four weeks of an infection, typically after a sexually transmitted infection (STI)\u00a0such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel.\nFor reasons that are still unclear, the immune system (the body's defence against infection) appears to malfunction in response to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed.\nRead more about the causes of reactive arthritis.\nSeeking medical advice\nSee\u00a0your GP if\u00a0you have\u00a0swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had\u00a0symptoms of an infection such as diarrhoea or pain when passing urine.\nThere is no single test for reactive arthritis, although blood and urine tests, genital swabs\u00a0and X-rays may be used to check for\u00a0infection and rule out other causes of your symptoms.\nYour GP will also want to know about your recent medical history,\u00a0such as whether you may have recently had a\u00a0bowel infection or an STI.\nHow reactive arthritis is treated\nThere is currently no cure for reactive arthritis, but most people get better in around six months. Meanwhile, treatment can help to relieve symptoms such as pain and stiffness.\nSymptoms can\u00a0often be controlled using\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and painkillers such as ibuprofen.\nSevere symptoms\u00a0may\u00a0require more powerful steroid medication (corticosteroids) or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\nRead more about treating reactive arthritis.\nWho is affected\nReactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young adults aged 20-40.\nMen are generally affected more than woman\u00a0\u2013 particularly in cases linked to STIs, which are estimated to be about 10 times more common in men.\nPeople who have a certain gene called HLA-B27, which is found in around one in every 10 people in the\u00a0UK,\u00a0are about thought to be around 50 times more likely to develop reactive arthritis than those who don't have this gene.\nPreventing reactive arthritis\nThe most effective way to reduce your risk of reactive arthritis is to avoid the STIs and\u00a0bowel infections that most commonly\u00a0cause the condition.\nThe most effective way of preventing STIs is to always use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, during sex with a new partner.\u00a0\nRead advice\u00a0on\u00a0contraception and sexual health.\n\n\nThe symptoms of reactive arthritis usually develop within four weeks of an infection.\nIn most cases, reactive arthritis follows a sexually transmitted infection (STI)\u00a0such as chlamydia, or a\u00a0bowel infection such as food poisoning.\nThe three parts of the body most commonly affected by reactive arthritis\u00a0are the:\n\njoints and\u00a0tendons\nurinary system\neyes\n\nHowever, most people won't experience problems in\u00a0all of these areas.\nJoints and tendons\nReactive arthritis usually involves inflammation of the joints (arthritis) and tendons, which can cause:\n\njoint pain, tenderness and swelling \u2013 usually in weight-bearing joints such as your knees, feet and ankles\nlower back and buttock pain\nswelling of your fingers and toes\njoint stiffness \u2013 particularly in the morning\n\nSee your GP if you have any swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had\u00a0diarrhoea or problems passing urine.\nThe urinary system\nReactive arthritis can sometimes also\u00a0involve inflammation of the urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis), which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. Symptoms of urethritis can\u00a0include:\n\npain or a burning sensation when you pee\nurinating more often than usual\nhaving a sudden urge to\u00a0pee\na discharge of fluid from the penis or vagina\nblood in your urine (less commonly)\n\nThe eyes\nReactive arthritis may occasionally\u00a0involve inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis). Symptoms of conjunctivitis can\u00a0include:\n\nred eyes\nwatery eyes\neye pain\nswollen eye lids\n\nIn rare cases, a type of\u00a0uveitis called iritis can develop.\u00a0Iritis can cause the eyes to become\u00a0painful, red and sensitive to light.\u00a0See your doctor or an eye specialist as soon as possible if you have these symptoms.\nOther symptoms\nReactive arthritis can also cause symptoms, including:\n\nfeeling unusually tired\na\u00a0high\u00a0temperature\u00a0(fever)\nweight loss\nmouth ulcers\npainless white\u00a0patches\u00a0inside your mouth\na rash\nthick and crumbly nails\nabdominal (tummy) pain\nbouts of\u00a0diarrhoea\n\n\n\nIt's not known exactly what causes reactive arthritis, but it's thought to be the result of the immune system reacting to an infection.\nThe immune system\nYour immune system is your body's defence against illness and infection. When it senses a virus or bacteria, it\u00a0sends antibodies and cells to fight the infection. This causes tissues to swell, known as inflammation, which makes\u00a0it harder for the\u00a0infection to spread.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn cases of reactive arthritis, something goes wrong with the immune system and it causes inflammation in parts of the body that were not infected, often after the infection has already passed.\nInfection\nThe two most common types of infection linked to reactive arthritis are:\n\nsexually transmitted infections (STIs)\u00a0\u2013 such as chlamydia\u00a0or gonorrhoea, although many cases\u00a0occur after\u00a0non-gonococcal urethritis\ninfections of the\u00a0bowel and digestive system (gastrointestinal infections) \u2013 usually\u00a0caused by either campylobacter or salmonella bacteria, both of which can cause food poisoning\n\nGenetic factors\nResearch has shown that people with a specific gene known as HLA-B27 have a significantly\u00a0increased chance of developing reactive arthritis, as well as related conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis that affects the spine).\nIn the UK, it's estimated that\u00a0around\u00a01 in every 10 people have the HLA-B27 gene. Around\u00a03\u00a0out of every\u00a04 cases of reactive arthritis develop in people with the gene.\nPeople with\u00a0the HLA-B27 gene also tend to have more severe and longer-lasting symptoms, with a greater risk of their symptoms recurring.\nExactly how the gene contributes to the development of reactive arthritis is unclear.\n\n\nThere's no cure for reactive arthritis, but the condition is usually temporary and treatment can help to relieve your symptoms.\nMost people will make a full recovery in about six months, although around one in five cases lasts a year or more, and a small number of people experience long-term joint problems.\nThere is also a risk you could develop the condition again after another infection.\nSelf-care\nIn the initial stages of reactive arthritis, it's recommended\u00a0that you get plenty of rest and avoid using affected joints.\nAs your symptoms improve, you should begin a gradual programme of exercise\u00a0designed to strengthen affected muscles and improve the range of movement in your affected joints.\nYour GP or specialist may recommend a suitable\u00a0exercise programme for your arthritis. Alternatively, you may be referred to a physiotherapist for physical therapy.\nYou might also find ice packs and heat pads useful in reducing joint pain and swelling, although these should not be directly placed on your\u00a0skin.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics\u00a0may not help to treat reactive arthritis itself, but they are sometimes prescribed if you have an ongoing infection\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you have a\u00a0sexually transmitted infection (STI). Your recent sexual partner(s) may also need treatment.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen,\u00a0are the main medication used for reactive arthritis, as they can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain.\nHowever, taking a regular dose of a NSAID on a long-term basis can increase your risk of problems such as stomach ulcers. If you are at an increased risk of developing stomach ulcers, your GP may recommend an additional medication known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which can protect your stomach by reducing the production of stomach acid.\nRarely, long-term use of NSAIDs\u00a0can also slightly increase your risk of having a\u00a0heart attack or stroke. Read more about the side effects of NSAIDs.\nSteroid medication\nSteroid medication (corticosteroids) may be recommended if your symptoms don't respond to NSAIDs, or you're unable to use NSAIDs.\nSteroids work by blocking the effects of many of the chemicals the body uses to trigger inflammation.\nA corticosteroid called prednisolone is usually the preferred choice. Prednisolone can be given as an injection into a joint or as a tablet. Eye drops are also available if you have inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis).\nAround\u00a01 in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state, such as depression or hallucinations. Contact your GP as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behaviour.\nOther side effects can include weight gain, acne, stomach ulcers and osteoporosis,\u00a0although these should improve as your dose is decreased. Read more about the side effects of corticosteroids.\nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\nIf your symptoms persist despite treatment with NSAIDs and/or corticosteroids, you may be prescribed a medication known as a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD).\nLike corticosteroids, DMARDs work by\u00a0blocking the effects of some of the chemicals your immune system uses to trigger inflammation.\nIt can take a few months before you notice a DMARD working, so it's important to keep taking medication even if you don't see immediate results.\nA DMARD called sulfasalazine is usually the preferred option. Common side effects of sulfasalazine include feeling sick, loss of appetite and headaches, although these usually improve once your body gets used to the medication.\u00a0\nDMARDs may also\u00a0cause changes in\u00a0your blood or liver, so it's important to have regular blood\u00a0tests while taking these medicines.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common condition of the nervous system that causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs.\nIt can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation\u00a0in the feet, calves and thighs. The sensation is often worse in the evening\u00a0or at night. Occasionally, the arms are affected too.\nRestless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).\nSome people have\u00a0the symptoms of restless legs syndrome occasionally, while others have them every day. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, restless legs syndrome can be very distressing and disrupt a person's daily activities.\nWhat causes restless legs syndrome?\nIn the majority of cases, there's no obvious cause of\u00a0restless legs syndrome. This known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families.\nSome neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles\u00a0a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and\u00a0may\u00a0be responsible for\u00a0the involuntary leg movements associated with\u00a0restless legs syndrome.\nIn some cases, restless legs syndrome is caused by an underlying health condition,\u00a0such as iron deficiency anaemia\u00a0or kidney failure. This is known as secondary\u00a0restless legs syndrome.\nThere's also a link between\u00a0restless legs syndrome and pregnancy. About 1 in\u00a05 pregnant women will experience symptoms in the last three months of their pregnancy, although it's not clear exactly why this is. In such cases,\u00a0restless legs syndrome usually disappears after the woman has given birth.\nRead more about the causes of restless legs syndrome\nTreating restless legs syndrome\nMild cases of\u00a0restless legs syndrome that aren't linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes, such as:\n\nadopting\u00a0good sleep habits\u00a0\u2013 for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night\nquitting smoking\u00a0if you\u00a0smoke\nexercising regularly\u00a0during the daytime\n\nIf your symptoms\u00a0are more severe, you may need medication to regulate the levels of dopamine and iron\u00a0in your body.\nIf\u00a0restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that's needed to treat the symptoms.\nRead more about treating restless legs syndrome\nWho's affected by restless legs syndrome?\nAs many as 1 in 10 people are affected by\u00a0restless legs syndrome at some point in their life.\nWomen are twice as likely to develop\u00a0restless legs syndrome than men. It's also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood.\nOutlook\nThe\u00a0symptoms\u00a0of\u00a0restless legs syndrome will usually disappear if it's possible to address an underlying cause.\u00a0\nHowever, if the cause\u00a0is unknown, the symptoms can sometimes get worse with time and severely affect the person's life. Restless legs syndrome isn't life threatening, but severe cases can severely disrupt sleep (causing insomnia)\u00a0and trigger anxiety and depression.\n\n\nRestless legs syndrome typically causes an overwhelming urge to move your legs and an uncomfortable sensation in your legs.\nThe sensation may also affect your arms, chest and face, too. It has been described as:\n\ntingling, burning, itching or throbbing\na \"creepy-crawly\" feeling\nfeeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs\na painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calves\u00a0\n\nThese unpleasant sensations\u00a0can range from mild to unbearable, and are usually worse in the evening and during the night. They can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs.\nSome people experience symptoms occasionally,\u00a0while others have them every day. You may find it difficult to\u00a0sit for long periods of time\u00a0\u2013 for example, on\u00a0a long train journey.\nJust over half of people with\u00a0restless legs syndrome also experience episodes of lowerback pain.\nPeriodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)\nUp to 80% of people with\u00a0restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).\nIf you have PLMS, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably,\u00a0usually\u00a0at night while you're asleep. The movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds.\nPLMS can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. The involuntary leg movements\u00a0can also occur when you're awake and resting.\n\n\nIn many cases, the exact cause of restless legs syndrome is unknown.\nWhen no cause can be found, it's\u00a0known as \"idiopathic\" or primary restless legs syndrome.\nResearch has identified specific genes related to restless legs syndrome, and\u00a0it can run in families. In these cases, symptoms usually occur before the age of 40.\nDopamine\nThere's evidence to suggest restless legs syndrome is related to a problem with part of the brain called the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia uses a chemical (neurotransmitter) called dopamine to help control muscle activity and\u00a0movement.\nDopamine acts as a messenger between the brain and nervous system to help the brain regulate and co-ordinate movement. If\u00a0nerve cells become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced, which causes muscle spasms and\u00a0involuntary movements.\nDopamine levels naturally fall towards the end of the day, which may explain why the\u00a0symptoms of restless legs syndrome are often worse in the evening and during the night.\nUnderlying health condition\nRestless legs syndrome can sometimes occur\u00a0as a complication of another health condition, or it can be the result of another health-related factor. This is known as secondary\u00a0restless legs syndrome.\nYou can\u00a0develop secondary\u00a0restless legs syndrome if you:\n\nhave\u00a0iron deficiency anaemia \u2013\u00a0low levels of iron in the blood can lead to a fall in dopamine, triggering\u00a0restless legs syndrome\nhave a long-term health condition \u2013\u00a0such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, an underactive thyroid gland, or fibromyalgia\u00a0\u00a0\nare pregnant \u2013\u00a0particularly from week 27\u00a0until birth; in most cases the symptoms disappear within four weeks of giving birth\n\nTriggers\nThere are a number of triggers that don't cause\u00a0restless legs syndrome, but can make symptoms worse. These include medications such as:\n\nsome antidepressants\nantipsychotics\nlithium\u00a0\u2013 used in the treatment of bipolar disorder\ncalcium channel blockers\u00a0\u2013 used in the treatment of high blood pressure\nsome antihistamines\nmetoclopramide\u00a0\u2013 used to relieve nausea\n\nOther possible triggers include:\n\nexcessive smoking, caffeine or\u00a0alcohol\nbeing overweight or obese\nstress\nlack of\u00a0exercise\n\n\n\nThere's no single test for diagnosing restless legs syndrome.\nA diagnosis will be based on your symptoms, your medical and family history, a physical examination, and your test results.\nYour GP should be able to diagnose restless legs syndrome, but they may refer you to a neurologist if there's any uncertainty.\nThere are four main criteria your GP or specialist will look for to confirm a diagnosis. These are:\n\nan overwhelming urge to move your legs, usually with an uncomfortable sensation such as\u00a0itching or tingling\nyour symptoms occur or get worse when you're resting or inactive\nyour symptoms are relieved by moving your legs or rubbing them\nyour symptoms are worse during the evening or at night\n\nAssessing your symptoms\nYour GP or specialist will ask you about the pattern of your symptoms to help assess their severity. For example, they may ask you:\n\nhow often you have symptoms\nhow unpleasant you find your symptoms\nwhether your symptoms cause significant distress\nwhether your sleep is disrupted, making you tired during the day\n\nKeeping a\u00a0sleep diary may help your doctor assess your symptoms. You can use the diary to record your daily sleeping habits, such as the time you go to bed, how long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake during the\u00a0night, and episodes of tiredness during the day.\nMild\u00a0symptoms of restless legs syndrome can usually be treated by making lifestyle changes\u00a0\u2013 for example, establishing a regular sleeping pattern and avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine, alcohol or tobacco, in the evening.\nIf your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to bring them under control.\nRead more about treating restless leg syndrome\nBlood tests\nYour GP may refer you for\u00a0blood tests to confirm or rule out possible underlying causes of restless legs syndrome.\u00a0For example, you may have blood tests to rule out conditions such as anaemia,\u00a0diabetes and kidney function problems.\nIt's particularly important to find out the levels of iron in your blood because low iron levels can sometimes cause secondary restless legs syndrome. Low iron levels can be treated with\u00a0iron tablets.\nSleep tests\nIf you have\u00a0restless legs syndrome and your sleep is being severely disrupted, sleep tests\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as a\u00a0suggested immobilisation test \u2013\u00a0may be recommended. The test involves\u00a0lying\u00a0on a bed for a set period of time without moving your legs while any\u00a0involuntary leg movements are monitored.\nOccasionally, polysomnography may be recommended. This is a test that measures your breathing rate, brain waves and heartbeat throughout the course of a night. The results will confirm whether you have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).\n\n\nMild restless legs syndrome that isn't linked to an underlying health condition can be managed with just a few lifestyle changes.\nIf symptoms are more severe, medication may be needed.\nRestless legs syndrome caused by an underlying health condition\u00a0can often be cured by\u00a0treating that condition. For example,\u00a0iron deficiency anaemia can be treated by taking iron supplements.\nIf it's associated with pregnancy, it\u00a0usually disappears on its own within four weeks of the birth.\nLifestyle changes\nA\u00a0number of lifestyle changes may be enough to ease the symptoms of restless legs syndrome,\u00a0including:\n\navoiding stimulants in the evening \u2013 such as caffeine, tobacco and alcohol\nnot smoking \u2013 read more about quitting smoking\ntaking regular daily exercise\u00a0\u2013 but avoid exercising near bedtime\npractising good sleep habits\u00a0\u2013 for example, going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, not napping during the day, taking time to relax before going to bed, and avoiding caffeine close to bedtime\navoiding medicines that trigger the symptoms or make them worse \u2013 if you think medication is causing your symptoms, continue to take it and make an appointment to see your GP\n\nDuring an episode of\u00a0restless legs syndrome, the following measures may help relieve your\u00a0symptoms:\n\nmassaging your legs\ntaking a hot bath in the evening\napplying a hot or cold compress to your leg muscles\ndoing activities that distract your mind, such as reading or watching television\nrelaxation exercises, such as\u00a0yoga or\u00a0tai chi\nwalking\u00a0and\u00a0stretching\n\nA\u00a0small medical trial carried out in 2011 found a type of osteopathic exercise technique called positional release manipulation could be of benefit to people with\u00a0restless legs syndrome. It involves holding different parts of the body in positions found to reduce feelings of pain and discomfort.\nMedication\nDopamine agonists may be recommended if you're experiencing frequent symptoms of restless legs syndrome. They work by increasing dopamine levels, which are often low.\nDopamine agonists that may be recommended\u00a0include:\n\nropinirole\u00a0\npramipexole\u00a0\nrotigotine\u00a0skin patch\n\nThese medications can occasionally make you feel sleepy, so you should be cautious when\u00a0driving or using tools or machinery after taking them. Other possible side effects\u00a0can include nausea, dizziness and headaches.\nIf you experience nausea while taking a dopamine agonist, you may be given medication to help with this (antiemitic medication).\nImpulse control disorder (ICD) is a less common side effect sometimes associated with dopamine agonists.\nPeople with ICD are unable to resist the urge to do something harmful to themselves or others. For example, this could be an\u00a0addiciton to alcohol, drugs, gambling, shopping, or sex\u00a0(hypersexuality).\nHowever, the urges associated with ICD will subside once treatment with the dopamine agonist is stopped.\nA mild opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol, may be prescribed to relieve pain associated with\u00a0restless legs syndrome.\nGabapentin and pregabalin are also sometimes prescribed to help relieve painful symptoms of restless legs syndrome. Side effects of these medications\u00a0include dizziness, tiredness and headaches.\nIf\u00a0restless legs syndrome\u00a0is disrupting your sleep, a short-term course of medication may be recommended to help you sleep.\nThese types of medication are known as hypnotics, and include temazepam and loprazolam. Hypnotics are usually only recommended for short-term use (typically no longer than a week).\nYou may find you still feel sleepy or \"hungover\" the morning after taking your medication.\u00a0\nLevodopa may be recommended if you only have occasional symptoms of restless legs syndrome. This is because if you took levodopa every day, there's a high risk it would actually make your symptoms worse.\nLevodopa is available in tablet or liquid form, and you should take it once you feel the symptoms of\u00a0restless legs syndrome coming on.\nThe medication will make you feel very sleepy (often suddenly), so you should never drive or use tools or machinery after taking levodopa.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints.\nThe hands, feet and wrists are commonly affected, but it can also cause problems in other parts of the body.\nThere may be periods where your symptoms become worse, known as a flare-up or flare.

You\u00a0may occasionally experience flares when your condition deteriorates and your symptoms become more severe.\nSymptoms affecting the joints\nRheumatoid arthritis is primarily a condition that affects the joints. It can cause problems in any joint in the body, although the small joints in the hands and feet are often the first to be affected.\nRheumatoid arthritis typically affects the joints symmetrically (both sides of the body at the same time and to the same extent), but this is not always the case.\nThe main symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the joints are outlined below.\nThe\u00a0joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0is usually a throbbing and\u00a0aching pain. It is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity.\nJoints affected by rheumatoid arthritis can feel stiff. For example, if your hands are affected, you may not be able to fully bend your fingers or form a fist.\nLike joint pain, the stiffness\u00a0is often\u00a0more severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Morning stiffness associated with another type of arthritis called\u00a0osteoarthritis usually wears off within 30 minutes of getting up, but rheumatoid arthritis morning stiffness often\u00a0lasts longer than this.\nThe lining of\u00a0joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis become inflamed, which can cause the joints to swell, and become hot and tender to touch.\nIn some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules can also develop under the skin around affected joints.\nAdditional symptoms\nAs well as problems affecting the joints, some people with rheumatoid arthritis experience a range of more general symptoms, such as:\n\ntiredness and a lack of energy\na high temperature (fever)\nsweating\na poor appetite\nweight loss\n\nThe inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis can also sometimes cause problems affecting other areas of the body, including\u00a0dry eyes if the eyes are affected and\u00a0chest pain if the heart or lungs are affected.

However, it is not yet known what triggers this.\nNormally, your immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses, helping fight infection.\u00a0But if you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints, where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint.\nThis causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering your joints to become sore and inflamed.\nThis inflammation in turn causes chemicals to be released that thicken the synovium and damage nearby:\n\nbones\ncartilage \u2013 the stretchy connective tissue between bones\ntendons \u2013 the tissue that connects bone to muscle\nligaments \u2013 the tissue that connects bone and cartilage\n\nIf the condition is not treated, these chemicals gradually cause the joint to lose its shape and alignment and, eventually, can destroy the joint completely.\nVarious theories of why the immune system starts to attack the joints have been suggested, including that an infection or\u00a0virus may trigger this, but none of these theories has been proven.\nPossible risk factors\nThere are a number of things that may increase your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, including:\n\nyour genes \u2013\u00a0there is some evidence that rheumatoid arthritis can run in families, although the risk of inheriting the condition is thought to be low as genes are only thought to play a small role in the condition\nhormones \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis is more common in women than men, which may be due to the effects of a hormone called oestrogen that is found at higher levels in women, although this has not been conclusively proven\nsmoking \u2013 some evidence suggests that people who smoke are at an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis\n\nWant to know more?\n\nNational Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS): Possible causes and risk factors\n\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose because many conditions cause joint stiffness and inflammation and there is no definitive test for the condition.\nYou should see your GP if you have these symptoms so they can try to determine the cause.\nSeeing your GP\nYour GP will\u00a0carry out a physical examination, checking your joints for any swelling and to assess how easily they move. Your GP will also ask you about your symptoms.\nIt is important to tell your GP about all\u00a0your symptoms, not just ones you think are important, as this will help\u00a0the doctor make the correct diagnosis.\nIf your GP thinks you have rheumatoid arthritis,\u00a0they will refer you to a specialist (rheumatologist).\nYour GP may arrange\u00a0blood tests to help confirm the diagnosis after conducting a physical examination and consulting your medical history, or they may refer you at the same time as requesting tests.\nBlood tests\nNo\u00a0blood test can\u00a0definitively prove or rule out a diagnosis of\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis, but\u00a0a number of tests can show possible indications of the condition. Some of the main tests used\u00a0are outlined below.\nIn an ESR test, a sample of your red blood cells\u00a0is placed into a test tube of liquid. The cells are then timed to see how fast they fall to the bottom of the tube (measured in millimetres per hour). If they are sinking faster than usual, you may have an inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\nA CRP test can indicate if there is inflammation anywhere in the body by checking how much CRP is present in your blood. CRP is produced by the liver. If there is more CRP than usual, there is inflammation in your body.\nThe full blood count will measure your red cells to rule out anaemia. Anaemia is a condition where the blood is unable to carry enough oxygen, due to a lack of blood cells.\nAnaemia is common in people with\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis, although\u00a0the problem can\u00a0have many causes, so having anaemia\u00a0does not prove that you have rheumatoid arthritis.\nSpecific blood tests can help to diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, but are not accurate in every person. About half of all people with rheumatoid arthritis have a positive rheumatoid factor present in their blood when the disease starts, but about one in every 20 people without rheumatoid arthritis also tests positive for this.\nAnother antibody test known as anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) is also available. People who test positive for anti-CCP are very likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis, but not everybody found to have rheumatoid arthritis has this antibody.\nThose who test positive for both rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP may be more likely to have severe rheumatoid arthritis requiring higher levels of treatment.\nJoint imaging\nA number of different scans may also be carried out to check for joint inflammation and damage. These can help differentiate between different types of arthritis\u00a0and can be used to monitor how\u00a0your condition is progressing over time.\nScans that may be carried out to diagnose and monitor rheumatoid arthritis include:\n\nX-rays\u00a0\u2013 where radiation is passed through your body to examine your bones and joints\nultrasound scans\u00a0\u2013 where high frequency sound waves are used to create an image of joints\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans\u00a0\u2013 where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of your joints\n\n\n\nStopping the condition progressing\nThere are a number of medications available that can be used to help stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse and reduce your risk of further problems.\nThese are often divided into two types of medication: 'disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)' and 'biological treatments'.\nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\nIf you have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, you will normally be offered a combination of DMARD tablets as part of your initial treatment, as\u00a0these medications are particularly effective in\u00a0easing symptoms of the condition and slowing down its progression.\nDMARDs work by\u00a0blocking the effects of the chemicals released when the immune system attacks the joints, which could otherwise\u00a0cause further damage to nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage.\nThere are many different DMARDs that can be used, including methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.\nMethotrexate is\u00a0normally the first\u00a0medicine given for rheumatoid arthritis, often alongside another DMARD and\u00a0a short-course of corticosteroids to relieve any\u00a0pain (see\u00a0below). It may also be combined with the biological treatments mentioned\u00a0below.\nCommon side effects of methotrexate include feeling sick, loss of appetite, a sore mouth, diarrhoea,\u00a0headaches and hair loss.\u00a0The medication\u00a0can also sometimes have an effect on your blood count and your liver,\u00a0so you will have regular blood tests to monitor this.\nLess commonly, methotrexate can affect the lungs, so you will usually have a chest X-ray and possibly breathing tests when you start taking methotrexate, to provide a comparison if you develop\u00a0shortness of breath or a persistent dry\u00a0cough while taking it. However, most people tolerate methotrexate well.\nIt can take a few months to notice a DMARD working. It is important to keep taking the medication, even if you do not notice it working at first.\nYou may have to try two or three types of DMARD before you find the one that is most suitable for you. Once you and your doctor work out the most suitable DMARD, you will usually have to take the medicine in the long term.\nBiological treatments\nBiological treatments are a newer form of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. They include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, rituximab, abatacept and tocilizumab.\nThey are usually taken in combination with methotrexate or another DMARD and are normally only used if these medications alone have not been effective.\nBiological medications are given by injection and they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack your joints.\nSide effects from biological treatments are usually mild and include skin reactions at the site of the injections, infections, feeling sick, a high temperature (fever) and headaches.\nSome people may also\u00a0be at risk of getting more serious problems, including the reactivation of infections such as tuberculosis (TB)\u00a0in people who have had them in the past.\nRelieving pain\nIn addition to the medications used to control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, you may also need to take medication specifically to relieve pain.\nSome of the different medicines that\u00a0may be used to relieve pain\u00a0are outlined below.\nPainkillers\nIn some cases, you may be advised to use painkillers such as paracetamol, or a combination of paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol) to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\nThese medications don't help treat the underlying inflammation of your joints, but they can sometimes be helpful in relieving pain. For example, they may be recommended while you are waiting to see a specialist or during periods where your symptoms are particularly bad (flare-ups).\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nIn addition to \u2013 or instead of \u2013 the painkillers mentioned above, your doctor may prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).\nThis may be a traditional NSAID (such as ibuprofen, naproxen or diclofenac) or an alternative type called a COX-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib).\nThese medications can help relieve pain while also reducing inflammation in the joints, although they will not stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse over time.\nYour doctor will discuss with you what type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with each of them.\nAlthough uncommon, taking an NSAID tablet can increase the risk of serious stomach problems \u2013 such as internal bleeding \u2013 because the medications can break down the lining that protects the stomach against damage from stomach acids.\nIf you are prescribed an NSAID tablet, you will often have to take another medicine, such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), as well. Taking a PPI reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which greatly reduces the risk of damage to your stomach lining.\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids are powerful medications that can help reduce pain, stiffness and inflammation.\nThey can be used as a tablet (for example, prednisolone), as an injection directly into a painful joint, or as an injection into the muscle (to help lots of joints).\nThey are usually used to provide short-term pain relief \u2013 for example, while you are waiting for DMARD medication to take effect or during a flare-up.\nCorticosteroids are normally only used in this way because long-term use of corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, osteoporosis (thinning of the bones), easy bruising, muscle weakness and thinning of the skin.\nSupportive treatments\nYour doctor may also refer you to other services that might be able to help you with your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.\nPhysiotherapy\nA physiotherapist\u00a0may help you improve your fitness and muscle strength, and make your joints more flexible.\nThey may also be able to help with pain relief using heat or ice packs, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). A TENS machine applies a small pulse of electricity to the affected joint, which\u00a0numbs the nerve endings and can help ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis.\nOccupational therapy\nIf rheumatoid arthritis causes you\u00a0problems with everyday tasks,\u00a0occupational therapy may help.\nAn occupational therapist can provide training and advice that will help you to protect your joints, both while you are at home and at work.\nSome type of support for your joints, such as a splint, may also be recommended, or devices that can help\u00a0open jars or turn on taps.\nPodiatry\nIf you have problems with your feet, a podiatrist may be able to help. You may also be offered some type of support for your joints or shoe insoles that can ease pain.\nSurgery\nSometimes, despite medication, damage to your joints may occur. In such cases, you may need surgery to help restore your ability to use your joint.\nSurgery may also be recommended to reduce pain\u00a0or correct deformities.\nFinger, hand and wrist surgery\nThere are different types of surgery to correct joint problems in the hand. Examples include:\n\ncarpal tunnel release (cutting a ligament in the wrist to relieve pressure on a nerve)\nrelease of tendons in the fingers to treat abnormal bending\nremoval of inflamed tissue that lines the finger joints\n\nArthroscopy\nArthroscopy is a procedure to remove inflamed joint tissue.\nDuring the operation, a thin tube with a light source and camera (arthroscope) is inserted into the joint through a small cut in the skin so that the surgeon can see the affected joint.\nSpecial surgical instruments are inserted through other small cuts in the skin to remove the damaged tissue. You usually do not have to stay overnight in hospital for this kind of surgery, but the joint will need to be rested at home for several days.\nJoint replacement\nSome people with rheumatoid arthritis will need surgery to\u00a0replace part or all of a joint, such as the hip, knee or shoulder joint. This is known as a joint replacement or arthroplasty.\nReplacement of these joints is a major operation that involves several days in hospital followed by months of rehabilitation.\nThe\u00a0latest joints have a limited lifespan of 10-20 years. They are not perfect and some function may not be restored after the damaged joint is replaced by a new one.\u00a0\nRead more about knee replacement and hip replacement.\nComplementary and alternative therapies\nMany people with rheumatoid arthritis try complementary therapies, such as:\n\nmassage\nacupuncture\nosteopathy\nchiropractic\n\nIn most cases, there is little or no evidence these are effective in the long-term, although some people may experience a short-term benefit from them.\nNutritional supplements and dietary changes\nThere is no strong evidence to suggest that specific dietary changes can help improve rheumatoid arthritis, although some people with rheumatoid arthritis feel that their symptoms get worse after they have eaten certain foods.\nIf you think this may be the case for you, it may be useful to try avoiding problematic foods for a few weeks to see if your symptoms improve. However, it is important to ensure your overall diet is still healthy and balanced.\nThere is also little evidence supporting the use of supplements in rheumatoid arthritis, although some can be useful in preventing side effects of medications you may be taking. For example,\u00a0calcium\u00a0and\u00a0vitamin D\u00a0supplements may help prevent osteoporosis if you are taking steroids and\u00a0folic acid supplements may help prevent some of the side effects of methotrexate.\nHowever, there is some evidence to suggest that taking fish oil supplements may help reduce joint pain and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nSelf-management\nTaking control of rheumatoid arthritis will help you cope with its impact on your lifestyle.\nArthritis Care offers self-management training courses to teach techniques for living positively with arthritis. Techniques include relaxation and breathing exercises to help pain control, goal-setting exercises and positive thinking to help give you some control over your condition.\nA self-management programme specifically for people with rheumatoid arthritis has been developed by the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS). The course helps people learn more about their condition and provides practical tips on how to manage everyday life.\nTalk to others\nMany people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from an individual or group of people with rheumatoid arthritis. Patient organisations have local support groups where you can meet others diagnosed with the same condition.\nCall the\u00a0NRAS helpline free\u00a0on\u00a00800 298 7650 to speak to a trained rheumatoid arthritis adviser. NRAS also has a team of medical advisers.\nYou can also call Arthritis Care's free, confidential helpline on 0808 800 4050 (Monday-Friday,\u00a010am-4pm).\nYour feelings\nIt can be hard to deal with the unpredictable nature of rheumatoid arthritis. Some days, the pain and stiffness will be much worse than others, and there is no way of knowing when a flare-up will occur.\nThe difficult nature of rheumatoid arthritis can mean that some people develop\u00a0depression or feelings of stress and anxiety. Sometimes, these feelings can be related to poorly controlled pain or fatigue. Living with any long-term condition makes you more likely to have a range of emotions such as frustration, fear, pain, anger and resentment.\nSpeak to your healthcare team if you are struggling to deal with your condition emotionally. They may be able to offer medication or psychological interventions to help.\nStarting and raising a family\nIf you are taking medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, let your healthcare team know if you want to start a family or if\u00a0you are worried about becoming pregnant while on medication.\nSome medications, such as methotrexate, leflunomide and biological treatments, should not be taken by men or women while they are trying for a baby. The doctors and nurses will work with you to ensure your rheumatoid arthritis is controlled while you are trying to get pregnant.\nBabies and young children are physically and mentally demanding for any parent, but particularly so if you have rheumatoid arthritis. If you are struggling to cope, it may help to talk to other people in the same situation as you. You may also be able to get additional support from your health visitor or occupational therapist to help you manage your young family.\nSex and relationships\nPain, discomfort and changes in the way you feel can affect your sex life. Your self-esteem or thoughts about how you look may affect your confidence.\nAlthough many people find it difficult to talk about such private issues, there are resources that might help you. Talking to your partner or GP about the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on your sexuality and sexual relationships may help.\nMoney and benefits\nIf you have to stop work or work part time because of your rheumatoid arthritis, you may find it hard to cope financially.\nYou may be entitled to one or more of the following types of financial support:\n\nIf you have a job, but cannot work because of your illness, you are entitled to\u00a0Statutory Sick Pay from your employer.\nIf you do not have a job and cannot work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance.\nIf you are aged 64 or under and need help with personal care or have walking difficulties, you may be eligible for a Personal Independence Payment.\nIf you are aged 65 or over, you may be able to get Attendance Allowance.\nIf you are caring for someone with rheumatoid arthritis, you may be entitled to Carer\u2019s Allowance.\n\nYou may also be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.\nTelecare Self-Check online tool\nVisit the Telecare Self-Check online tool to find the right support for you in your area.\u00a0This easy to use online tool allows you to find helpful information on telecare services that could help you live independently at home for longer.\n\n\n\nHaving rheumatoid arthritis can put you at a higher risk of developing other conditions, particularly if it isn't well controlled.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\u00a0is\u00a0a common condition in people with rheumatoid arthritis.\nIt is the result of compression of the nerve that controls sensation and movement in the hands (median nerve) and can cause symptoms such as aching, numbness and tingling in your thumb, fingers and part of the hand.\nSymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome can sometimes be controlled with wrist splints or\u00a0corticosteroid injections, although surgery to release the pressure on the median nerve may be\u00a0needed in severe cases.\nWidespread inflammation\nAs\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition, it can cause inflammation to develop in other parts of your body, such as the:\n\nLungs \u2013\u00a0inflammation of the lungs or lung lining can lead to pleurisy or pulmonary fibrosis, which can cause chest pain, a persistent cough and shortness of breath.\nHeart \u2013 inflammation of the tissue around the heart can lead to pericarditis, which causes chest pain.\nEyes \u2013 inflammation of the eyes can lead to scleritis or Sjogren's syndrome. Scleritis can cause eye redness and pain, whereas Sjogren's syndrome can cause dry eyes.\nBlood vessels \u2013\u00a0inflammation of the blood vessels is known as vasculitis. This can lead to the thickening, weakening, narrowing and scarring of blood vessel walls. In serious cases, it can affect blood flow to your body's organs and tissues and can be life-threatening.\n\nHowever, thanks to early treatment, inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis affecting other parts of the body is becoming less common.\u00a0\nJoint damage\nIf rheumatoid arthritis is not treated early or is not well controlled, the inflammation in your joints could lead to significant and permanent damage.\nProblems that can affect the joints include:\n\ndamage to nearby bone and cartilage (a tough, flexible tissue that covers the surface of joints)\ndamage to nearby tendons (flexible tissue that attach muscle to bone), which could cause them to break (rupture)\njoint deformities\n\nThese problems will sometimes need to be treated with surgery to prevent loss of function in the affected joints.\u00a0\nCardiovascular disease\nIf you have rheumatoid arthritis, you are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) than the population at large.\nCVD is\u00a0a general term that describes conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels, and it includes life-threatening problems such as heart attacks and strokes.\nIt's not clear exactly why people with rheumatoid arthritis are at an increased risk of these problems, but you can reduce your risk by ensuring your arthritis is well controlled and by reducing the impact of other factors that contribute to CVD, such as by stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly.\nRead more about preventing CVD.\nCervical myelopathy\nIf you have had rheumatoid arthritis for some time, you are at increased risk of developing cervical myelopathy and you may need a special assessment of your neck before any operation where you are put to sleep.\nThis condition is caused by dislocation of joints at the top of the spine, which put pressure on the spinal cord. Although relatively uncommon, it is a serious condition that can greatly affect your mobility and can lead to permanent spinal cord damage if not treated promptly with surgery.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Ringworm is a common fungal infection that can cause a red or silvery ring-like rash on the skin. Ringworm commonly affects arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. Despite its name, ringworm doesn't have anything to do with worms.\nOther similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails. These fungal infections, medically known as \"tinea\", are not serious and are usually easily treated. However,\u00a0they are\u00a0contagious and easily spread.\nTinea fungal infections\nThere are different types of tinea fungal infection, based on the affected area of the body:\n\nringworm\u00a0(tinea corporis) \u2013 affecting the body\nfungal nail infection (onychomycosis) \u2013 affecting the nails\nathlete's foot (tinea pedis) \u2013 affecting the feet\njock itch (tinea cruris) \u2013 affecting the groin\ntinea capitis \u2013 affecting the scalp\n\nRingworm usually looks like a round, red or silvery patch of skin that may be scaly, inflamed and itchy, but other fungal infections may present themselves slightly differently. Read more about the symptoms of ringworm and other tinea fungal infections.\nWhen to see a doctor\nSee your GP if you or your child has a fungal scalp infection, as it\u2019s treated with antifungal tablets, which are only available on prescription. Symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include small patches of scaly scalp skin (which may be sore), patchy hair loss and itchiness. Other types of fungal infections (including ringworm) are generally treated with antifungal cream from the pharmacy, and you don't need to see a doctor unless it persists. However, pharmacists often prefer children to see a GP to confirm a diagnosis.\nWhat\u2019s the cause?\nFungal spores are passed between people through direct skin contact and by sharing objects such as towels, hairbrushes and bedding. Athlete\u2019s foot is commonly spread in gym and swimming pool changing rooms.  Pets, such as dogs and cats, can have ringworm, and you can catch it by stroking them.  Read more about the causes of ringworm.\nWho is affected?\nIt's estimated that 10-20% of people will have\u00a0ringworm in their lifetime.  Although children are more likely to get this, people of all ages can be affected.  Groin infections are more common in young men.  Fungal scalp infections (tinea capitis) are most common in children who have not reached puberty, particularly African-Caribbean children and those who live in urban areas.\nTreatment\nMost ringworm infections are mild and can be treated using a pharmacy antifungal cream. Scalp infections can be treated with antifungal tablets, sometimes combined with antifungal shampoo. If the skin is irritated or broken, it can lead to other bacterial infections, which may need treatment with antibiotics. Read more about how to treat fungal infections.\nStopping it spreading\nIt's important to prevent the infection spreading. You should avoid sharing towels, bedding or clothes with someone with a fungal infection. If you think your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. If your pet is treated quickly, you\u2019ll be less likely to catch it. If your child has a fungal infection, they can go to school, but you should inform their teacher. In addition to treatment, your child should maintain a good level of personal hygiene to prevent the infection spreading. Read more about how to stop the spread of fungal infections.\n\n\nThe symptoms of a tinea fungal infection depend on where the infection is.\nRingworm (on the skin)\nThe symptoms of ringworm include:\n\na ring-like red or silvery rash on your skin \u2013 your skin will look red and irritated around the ring, but healthy inside\nscaly, itchy and inflamed skin\n\nIn more severe cases:\n\nthe rings may multiply, grow in size and merge together\nthe rings may feel slightly raised and the skin underneath may be itchy\nblisters and pus-filled sores may form around the rings\n\nThe ring spreads outwards as it progresses. You can have one patch or several patches of ringworm, and in more serious cases, your skin may become raised and blistered.\nRingworm\u00a0on the face and neck may not appear ring-shaped, but may be itchy and swollen, and it can become dry and crusted. If you have a beard, you may notice patches of hair breaking away.\nRingworm on the hand often causes the skin to become thicker on the palm and in between the fingers. It may affect one hand or both and normally only appears on one side.\nFungal scalp infection (tinea capitis)\nThe symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include:\n\nsmall patches of scaly skin on the scalp, which may be sore\npatchy hair loss\nan itchy scalp\n\nIn more severe cases:\n\nsmall, pus-filled sores on the scalp\ncrusting on the scalp\nbald patches (if your hair is affected)\n\nIn very severe cases, a large inflamed sore called a kerion may form on your scalp. This can ooze pus, and you may also have a fever and swollen lymph glands.\nAthlete\u2019s foot (tinea pedis)\nThe main symptom of athlete\u2019s foot is an itchy, dry, red and flaky rash, usually in the spaces between your toes. In more severe cases, you may have:\n\ncracked skin in the affected area\nblisters, which may ooze or crust\nswelling of the skin\na burning or stinging sensation in your skin\nscaling patterns around your sole, between your toes and on the side of your foot\n\nJock itch (tinea cruris)\nThe symptoms of jock itch include:\n\nred-brown sores, which may have blisters or pus-filled sores around the edge\nitchiness and redness around your groin area, such as your inner thighs and bottom (the genitals are not usually affected)\nscaly, flaky skin on your inner thighs\n\nExercising, walking and wearing tight clothing or underwear can make the symptoms of a groin infection worse.\nFungal nail infection (onychomycosis)\nThe symptoms of a fungal nail infection include:\n\na whitish thickening of the nail\ndiscolouration (the nail can turn white, black, yellow or green)\nthe nail can become brittle and start to fall off\nthe skin around the nail may be sore and irritated\n\nRead more about fungal nail infection\nWhen to seek medical advice\nMake an appointment to see your GP if you:\n\nor your child develop the symptoms of a fungal scalp infection\nhave ringworm that has not improved after two weeks of treatment with antifungal cream\nhave another medical condition, or you\u2019re having medical treatment that is known to weaken your immune system, such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets\n\nRead more about how fungal infections are diagnosed.\n\n\nTinea fungal infections are caused by a particular type of fungi, called dermatophytes, which live off keratin.Keratin is a tough, waterproof tissue found in many parts of your body, including your skin, hair and nails.This explains why fungal infections mostly affect your skin, scalp or nails.\nHow it spreads\nThe fungi are tiny spores tough enough to survive for months on your skin, in soil or on household objects, such as combs or towels. They thrive in heat and moisture, which helps them to grow and explains why they are often spread in swimming pool changing rooms and communal showers. The spores can be spread in four different ways:\n\nhuman-to-human contact\nhuman-to-animal contact \u2013 for example, by stroking an infected dog or cat\nhuman-to-object contact \u2013 both animals and humans can leave traces of fungi spores on objects and surfaces, such as towels, clothing, bed linen, combs or brushes\nhuman-to-soil contact \u2013 less commonly, it can develop after lengthy exposure to infected soil\n\nAs an adult, you can become a carrier of a scalp infection without developing any symptoms. This is because your body has usually developed a defence against the infection by the time you reach adulthood. If you\u2019re a carrier of a fungal infection, you can unknowingly pass the condition on to children, who may then go on to develop symptoms.\nRisk groups\nYou are more likely to develop a fungal infection if you:\n\nare very young or very old\nare African-Caribbean (in the case of scalp infections)\nhave type 1 diabetes\nare very overweight (obese)\nhave a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as HIV or AIDS\nare receiving medical treatment that weakens your immune system, such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets\nhave had fungal infections in the past\nhave hardened arteries (atherosclerosis)\nhave poor circulation (specifically, a condition called venous insufficiency, where the veins in your legs have trouble moving blood back to your heart)\n\n\n\nRingworm and other tinea fungal infections are usually easy to diagnose from their appearance and location.\nFungal scalp infections\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose a scalp infection after examining your scalp. Knowing exactly which fungus is causing the infection is useful, because some antifungal medications are better at treating certain types. Your GP will take a small scraping of skin from your scalp to test in a laboratory. You may be given an antifungal medication before you receive your test results. If the tests show that a different antifungal medication would work better, you will be prescribed that instead.\nRingworm and other fungal infections\nMost fungal infections can be diagnosed by your GP after examining your skin and asking whether you have other related symptoms. Further tests will usually only be needed if your symptoms are severe or if they fail to respond to antifungal treatment. If this happens, your GP may take a small scraping of affected skin for analysis in a laboratory. Microscopic analysis will show if fungi are present and the specific type that is causing your infection. Read about how to treat ringworm and other fungal infections.\n\n\nMost tinea fungal infections, including ringworm, are easily treated by using antifungal creams, tablets or shampoo. You can also help to get rid of fungal infections and stop them from spreading by:\n\nwashing areas of affected skin daily and drying thoroughly, paying particular attention to skin folds and between your toes\nin the case of a groin/foot infection, changing your underwear/socks daily, because fungi can persist in flakes of skin\nwith a scalp infection, not sharing combs, hairbrushes or hats\nwashing clothes, towels and bed linen frequently\nwearing loose-fitting clothes, preferably made of cotton or other natural materials\n\nRead more about preventing ringworm.\nRingworm, groin infections and athlete\u2019s foot\nMost cases of ringworm, groin infections and athlete\u2019s foot can be treated using an over-the-counter antifungal cream, gel or spray. There are lots of different types, so ask your pharmacist to help you choose the right one for you. You usually apply antifungal creams, gels and sprays daily to the affected areas of skin for two weeks. The cream, gel or spray should be applied over the rash and to one inch of skin beyond the edge of the rash. Read the manufacturer's instructions first. You may be advised to use the treatment for a further two weeks, to reduce the risk of re-infection. See your GP if your symptoms have not improved after two weeks of treatment, because you may need to take antifungal tablets. Both terbinafine and griseofulvin tablets can be used to treat ringworm infections, as well as another antifungal medicine called itraconazole (see below).\nTreat groin and feet together\nGroin infections can sometimes occur at the same time as athlete's foot. It's vital to treat both infections at the same time to avoid being re-infected with either condition.\nFungal scalp infections\nScalp infections are usually treated using antifungal tablets, often alongside an antifungal shampoo. There are two main types of antifungal tablet:\n\nterbinafine\ngriseofulvin\n\nThe antifungal medicine that your GP prescribes will depend on the type of fungi causing the infection.\nTerbinafine tablets\nMost people with fungal scalp infections are prescribed terbinafine tablets to take once a day for four weeks. It's an effective treatment for most cases. Side effects of terbinafine can include:\n\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\nindigestion\nrashes\n\nThese side effects are usually mild and short-lived. Some people have also reported that terbinafine temporarily affected their sense of taste.  Terbinafine is not suitable for people with a history of liver disease or lupus (where the immune system attacks healthy tissue).\nGriseofulvin\nGriseofulvin is a type of antifungal medicine that prevents fungi from growing and multiplying. It\u2019s available in the form of a spray and is usually taken daily for 8-10 weeks. Side effects of griseofulvin can include:\u00a0\n\nnausea\nvomiting\nmild diarrhoea\nheadache\nindigestion\u00a0\n\nHowever, these side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine. Griseofulvin can cause birth defects, so it shouldn't be taken during pregnancy, or if you intend to become pregnant soon after stopping treatment. Men shouldn't father a child within six months of stopping treatment. Griseofulvin is also not suitable for women who are breastfeeding, and those with severe liver disease or lupus. Griseofulvin can interfere with both the combined contraceptive pill and the progestogen-only pill, so women need to use an alternative barrier form of contraception, such as a condom, while taking it. Griseofulvin may also affect your ability to drive and can enhance the effects of alcohol.\nAntifungal shampoo\nAntifungal shampoo cannot cure scalp infections, but it can help to prevent the infection spreading and may speed up recovery. Antifungal shampoos, such as selenium sulphide and ketoconazole shampoo, are available from your pharmacist. Ideally, antifungal shampoo should be used twice a week during the first two weeks of treatment. There is no evidence that shaving a child's head will reduce the risk of an infection or speed up recovery.\nItraconazole\nItraconazole is usually prescribed in the form of capsules for 7 or 15 days. It is not recommended for use in children, elderly people or those with severe liver disease. Side effects of itraconazole can include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\nindigestion\ndiarrhoea\nheadache\n\nRead about how to stop ringworm spreading or coming back.\nFungal nail infections\nFungal nail infections can be treated with antifungal nail paint, but it also often requires antifungal tablets. These tend to work better than nail paints, although they can cause side effects, such as headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Read more about treating fungal nail infections.\n\n\nThe advice outlined below will help to stop fungal infections from spreading. The fungi that cause tinea infections can survive on items such as furniture, hairbrushes, clothing and towels, and can be spread through contact with these items. Therefore, if someone in your household has a fungal infection, you should:\n\navoid sharing personal items \u2013 such as combs, hairbrushes, towels, clothing and bed linen\navoid scratching the affected areas of your skin or scalp, because it could spread the infection to other parts of your body\n\nIt\u2019s important that other household members check themselves for signs of infection and get treatment if necessary. If you suspect that your pet is the source of the infection, take them to your vet for treatment. Patches of missing fur is a sign that an animal has ringworm. Always wash your hands after touching a pet with the infection. If someone in your family has a fungal infection, there is no need for them to stay off work or school. However, treatment should be started as soon as possible. Good personal hygiene should also be followed to stop it spreading to other children. Wearing something on your feet in gym and swimming pool changing rooms will reduce your chances of getting athlete\u2019s foot.

Early diagnosis and\u00a0treatment can help stop the condition getting worse.\nThere's no specific test for rosacea, but your GP will often be able to diagnose the condition by:\n\nexamining your skin\nasking about your symptoms\nasking about possible triggers you may have\n\nIn some circumstances your GP may arrange further tests\u00a0to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as lupus\u00a0or the menopause. For example, these could be a blood test\u00a0or\u00a0skin biopsy, where a small scraping of skin is removed and examined.\nCauses of rosacea\nThe exact\u00a0cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of possible factors have been suggested, including abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face and a reaction to microscopic mites commonly found on the face.\nAlthough they're not thought to be direct causes of the condition, several triggers have been identified that may make rosacea worse.\nThese include:\n\nexposure to sunlight\nstress\nstrenuous exercise\nhot or cold weather\nhot drinks\nalcohol and caffeine\ncertain foods, such as spicy foods\n\nRead about causes of rosacea\nTreating rosacea\nThere's currently no cure for rosacea, but treatment can help control the symptoms.\nLong-term treatment\u00a0is usually necessary, although there may be periods when your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.\nFor most people, treatment involves a combination of self-help measures and medication, such as:\n\navoiding known triggers \u2013 for example, avoiding drinks containing alcohol or caffeine\ncreams and gels \u2013 medications applied directly to the skin to reduce spots and redness\noral medications \u2013 tablets or capsules that can\u00a0help clear up more severe spots, such as oral antibiotics\n\nIn some cases procedures such as laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment may be helpful.\u00a0These involve\u00a0beams of light\u00a0being aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin to shrink them and make them less visible.\nRead about more about\u00a0treating rosacea\u00a0and\u00a0self-help measures for rosacea\nLiving with rosacea\nAny long-term (chronic) condition can have an adverse psychological effect, but rosacea can be particularly troublesome\u00a0as it affects your appearance. This can change how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others.\nMany people with rosacea have reported feelings of low self-esteem, embarrassment and frustration.\nIt's important to try to come to terms with the fact you have a chronic condition that, although incurable, is controllable.\nPersevering with your treatment plan and avoiding your individual triggers are the best ways of controlling your symptoms.\nAs your physical symptoms improve, you\u00a0may start to feel better psychologically and emotionally.\nIf you have rosacea, take comfort in knowing you're not alone. There are millions of people living with the condition\u00a0in the UK and across the world.\nYou can find support and information from organisations like:\n\nChanging Faces\u00a0\u2013 a charity for people with a visible difference or facial disfigurement, who can be contacted on\u00a00300 012 0275 for counselling and advice\n\nSpeak to your GP if you're feeling\u00a0depressed as a result of your condition. They may recommend further treatment if necessary.\nOcular rosacea\nRosacea that affects your eyes (ocular rosacea) can lead to a number of eye problems, some of which can be serious.\nSymptoms of ocular rosacea can include:\n\nfeeling like there is something in your eyes\ndry eyes\nirritated and bloodshot eyes\ninflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis)\n\nRosacea can sometimes cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eyeball, to become inflamed and damaged. This is known as keratitis.\nThis damage can make the cornea vulnerable to ulceration and infection, which could potentially threaten your sight.\nSymptoms of serious problems with your corneas include:\n\neye pain\nsensitivity to light (photophobia)\ndeterioration in your vision\n\nContact your GP immediately if you think you may have a problem with your corneas. If this isn't possible, visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department.\nIf keratitis isn't treated promptly by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions, there's a risk of permanent vision loss.\n\n\nRosacea causes a range of symptoms, although not everyone will experience them all.\nMost people with rosacea have periods when their symptoms are particularly troublesome, followed by periods\u00a0when their symptoms are less so.\nThe main symptoms of rosacea include:\n\nflushing\npersistent facial redness\nvisible blood vessels\npapules and pustules\nthickened skin\n\nThese are discussed in more detail below.\nOther symptoms associated with rosacea include:\n\nsensitive skin\u00a0\u2013 burning, itching, stinging and\u00a0pain\ndry, rough skin\nraised red patches (plaques) on your skin\nfacial swelling (lymphoedema)\n\nPermanent damage to the face (scarring) almost never occurs in rosacea.\nFlushing\nFlushing\u00a0is when your skin turns red for a short period\u00a0\u2013 usually a few minutes. It tends to mainly affect the face, although it can spread to your neck and chest.\nIn some cases the redness may be accompanied by an unpleasant feeling of heat.\nIn rosacea flushing\u00a0is often caused by a certain trigger, such as sun exposure, hot drinks or exercise. See\u00a0causes of rosacea for more information about possible triggers.\nPersistent facial redness\nPersistent facial redness (erythema) is\u00a0like\u00a0a blush or a patch of sunburn that doesn't go away, or the sort of blotchy skin often associated with drinking too much alcohol.\nThis can be upsetting for those with rosacea as people can mistakenly assume they are heavy drinkers.\nThe redness usually affects the cheeks, nose and chin, but may spread to other areas, such as the forehead, neck and chest.\nVisible blood vessels\nOver time the blood vessels in the skin may become permanently widened\u00a0(dilated) and visible. The medical name for visible blood vessels is telangiectasia.\nPapules and pustules\nIf you have rosacea, you may develop round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings\u00a0(pustules).\nThese spots appear on your face and are similar to acne. Rosacea used to be called acne rosacea, but the 2\u00a0conditions are quite different.\nIn rosacea there are no blackheads\u00a0and\u00a0the skin is not greasy, but dry and peeling. Rosacea spots also don't cause scarring.\nThickened skin\nIn the most serious cases of rosacea the skin can thicken and form excess tissue, usually around the nose. This causes the nose to take on a large, bulbous appearance (rhinophyma).\nRhinophyma is an uncommon,\u00a0severe\u00a0symptom of rosacea and takes several years to develop. It\u00a0almost exclusively affects men.\n\n\nThe exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of potential factors have been suggested.\nIt's possible a combination of these factors may be responsible for the condition, although there isn't enough evidence to say this for certain.\nSome of the main factors that have been suggested are outlined below.\nBlood vessel abnormalities\nSome experts believe abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face may be a major contributing factor for rosacea. This may explain symptoms of flushing, persistent redness and visible blood vessels.\nIt's not known what causes these abnormalities. But sun damage may be responsible for degeneration of the elastic tissue of the skin and the dilation of blood vessels.\nSkin peptides\nRecent research has shown external triggers such as ultraviolet (UV) light, spicy food, alcohol (particularly red wine), exercise, stress, heat and cold can lead to the\u00a0activation of certain molecules within the skin called peptides.\nIncreased levels of these peptides may in turn affect the immune system or\u00a0nerves and blood vessels\u00a0(neurovascular system) of the skin. Activation of these systems can cause dilation of blood vessels, redness and inflammation.\nMicroscopic mites\nMicroscopic mites called demodex folliculorum usually live harmlessly on human skin, but people with rosacea have particularly large numbers, which may play a role in the condition.\nIt is currently uncertain whether the mite is a cause or an effect of rosacea, although some\u00a0researchers have suggested the symptoms may be caused by the skin reacting to\u00a0bacteria in the mites' faeces.\nHelicobacter pylori bacteria\nHelicobacter pylori bacteria are bacteria\u00a0found in the digestive system. It's been suggested these bacteria may be a possible cause of rosacea, although\u00a0a link\u00a0hasn't been proven.\nOne theory is the bacteria may stimulate the production of a protein called bradykinin, which is known to cause blood vessels to expand.\nGenetics\nRosacea seems to be more common in families, although it's not clear which genes\u00a0\u2013 if any\u00a0\u2013 are involved or how they're passed on.\nTriggers of rosacea\nAlthough they're not thought to be direct causes of\u00a0the condition, many people with rosacea find certain triggers make their symptoms worse.\nDifferent people can have different triggers, but triggers that have been commonly reported include:\n\nexposure to sunlight\nstress\nhot or cold weather\nstrong\u00a0winds\nstrenuous exercise\nalcohol\nhot baths\nspicy foods\nhot drinks\nhumidity\ncaffeine\u00a0\u2013 found in tea, coffee and cola\nthe menopause\ndairy products\nother\u00a0medical conditions\ncertain medicines\u00a0\u2013 such as amiodarone, corticosteroids and high doses of vitamins B6 and B12\n\n\n\nAlthough rosacea can't be cured, treatment can help keep the symptoms under control.\nLong-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods where your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily.\nTreatment choices depend on\u00a0which type of symptom is most troublesome, but usually involves a combination of\u00a0self-help measures and medication, and are\u00a0outlined below.\u00a0\nSelf-help measures\nThere are a number of\u00a0things you can do yourself to help keep the symptoms of rosacea under control, including:\n\navoiding things that trigger your symptoms \u2013 for example, by using sun cream and covering yourself up if direct sunlight makes your symptoms worse\ntaking good care of your skin \u2013 for example, by\u00a0using\u00a0products suitable for sensitive skin\nusing make-up \u2013\u00a0patches of persistent red skin can be disguised using specially designed camouflage make-up\nkeeping your eyelids clean \u2013 if rosacea is causing your eyelids to become inflamed (blepharitis)\n\nTreating papules and pustules\nIf you have\u00a0round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules) caused by rosacea, there are a number of different medications that can be effective.\nThese can be divided into topical treatments that are applied to the skin, or oral treatments, which are taken by mouth.\nTopical medications are usually prescribed first. These include:\n\nmetronidazole cream or gel\nazelaic acid cream or gel\nivermectin cream\n\nIvermectin is a relatively new medicine. There's some evidence to suggest it may be more effective and perhaps less irritating to the skin than metronidazole, although it's not currently available on the NHS everywhere and may only be recommended if the other treatments don't work.\nYou'll usually need to apply these topical treatments once or twice a day, taking care not to get them in your eyes or mouth. It may be several weeks before you notice any significant improvement in your symptoms.\nSide effects of these treatments can include a burning or stinging sensation, itchiness and dry skin.\nIf your symptoms are more severe, an oral antibiotic medication may be recommended as these can help reduce\u00a0inflammation of the skin.\nAntibiotics often used to treat rosacea include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and erythromycin.\u00a0\nThese medications are usually taken for 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks, but longer courses may be necessary if the spots are persistent.\nFor example, a low-dose doxycycline capsule is available if oral antibiotics need to be taken long term.\nCommon side effects of these medications include:\n\nfeeling and being sick\ndiarrhoea\nbloating and\u00a0indigestion\ntummy (abdominal)\u00a0pain\nloss of appetite\n\nSome of the medications used can also\u00a0make your skin sensitive to sunlight and artificial sources of light, such as sun lamps and sunbeds.\nAs with the topical treatments mentioned above, these medications usually need to be taken\u00a0once or twice a day and you may not notice a significant improvement in your symptoms for several weeks.\nOral\u00a0isotretinoin\nIsotretinoin is a medicine often used to treat severe acne,\u00a0but at lower doses it's also occasionally used to treat rosacea.\nAs isotretinoin is a strong medication that can cause a range of side effects, it can only be prescribed by a\u00a0specialist\u00a0in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) and not your GP.\nCommon side effects of isotretinoin include:\n\ndryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils\ninflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) or\u00a0eyes (conjunctivitis)\nheadaches\nmuscle or\u00a0joint pain\nback pain\nblood in your urine (haematuria)\nmood changes\n\nIsotretinion can also cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy.\nTreating facial redness\nTreating\u00a0facial redness and\u00a0flushing caused by rosacea\u00a0is generally more difficult than treating papules and pustules caused by the condition.\u00a0\nBut as well as\u00a0the self-help measures mentioned above, there are some medications that can help.\nBrimonidine tartrate is a relatively new medication for facial redness caused by rosacea. It comes in the form of a\u00a0gel that's applied to the face once a day.\nThe medication works by restricting the widening (dilation) of the blood vessels in your face. Research\u00a0has shown it can start to have an effect about 30 minutes after it's first used, and this can last for around 12 hours.\nCommon side effects of\u00a0brimonidine tartrate include itchiness and a burning sensation where the gel is applied.\nLess common side effects can include:\n\na dry mouth\nheadaches\npins and needles\ndry skin\n\nA rebound effect, where flushing becomes worse, has also been reported with this medication.\nAlternatively, there are a number of oral medications that may help improve redness caused by rosacea.\nThese include:\n\nclonidine\u00a0\u2013 a medication that relaxes the blood vessels\nbeta-blockers\u00a0\u2013 medications that decrease the activity of the heart\nanxiety medications\u00a0\u2013 medications sometimes used to help calm the person and reduce blushing\u00a0\n\nIt's not clear how effective these medications are at treating redness caused by rosacea, but they may sometimes be prescribed under the supervision of a dermatologist.\nRedness and visible blood vessels (telangiectasia) can also sometimes be successfully improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment. These treatments may also improve flushing.\nA referral to a dermatologist is usually required before having these treatments and they're not usually available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for them privately. Around 2\u00a0to 4\u00a0treatments may be needed, so the overall cost may be significant.\nLaser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light that are aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers damages the dilated veins and causes them to shrink so they're no longer visible, with minimal scarring or damage to the\u00a0surrounding area.\nLaser treatment can cause pain, but most people don't need an anaesthetic. Side effects of laser treatment are usually mild and can include:\n\nbruising\ncrusting of the skin\nswelling and redness of the skin\nblisters\u00a0(in rare cases)\ninfection (in very rare cases)\n\nThese side effects usually only last a few days and are rarely permanent.\nTreating thickened skin\nIn some people with rosacea the skin of the nose can become thickened. This is known as\u00a0rhinophyma.\nIf you have severe rhinophyma, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to\u00a0discuss\u00a0ways the appearance of your skin can be improved.\nA number of surgical treatments are available to remove any excess tissue and remodel the nose into a more pleasing shape.\nThis may be done with a\u00a0laser, a scalpel or specially designed abrasive instruments using a technique called dermabrasion.\nTreating eye problems\nIf rosacea\u00a0is affecting your eyes (ocular rosacea), you may require further treatment.\u00a0\nFor example, you may need to use lubricating eye drops or ointment if you have dry eyes, or oral antibiotics if you have blepharitis.\nIf\u00a0initial treatment isn't\u00a0effective or you develop any further problems with your eyes, you'll need to be referred to an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist for further assessment and treatment.\n\n\nIf you have rosacea, there are a number of things you can do to help keep the condition under control.\nAvoid triggers\nMany people with rosacea notice certain triggers make their symptoms worse. Although it's not always practical or possible, taking\u00a0steps\u00a0to avoid these triggers can\u00a0help reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms.\nIf you're not sure whether your symptoms have a specific trigger, it may be useful to keep a diary to identify whether your symptoms get worse depending on things\u00a0like the activities you do and foods or drinks you have.\nAdvice about how to avoid some common triggers can be found\u00a0below.\nAs sunlight is the most commonly reported trigger of rosacea, you should use sun cream whenever possible, even when it's overcast.\nA sun cream with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 is recommended. A broad-spectrum sun cream that protects against UVA and UVB light should be used.\nUsing sun creams specifically designed for children may help reduce skin irritation. Covering exposed skin with clothes or a sun hat may also help.\nTry to minimise your exposure to the sun during the summer months, particularly in the middle of the day when the sun is at its hottest.\u00a0\nBut remember, sun can also be strong in the morning and evening, so take adequate precautions at these times as well.\nStress is also a commonly\u00a0reported trigger of rosacea. Successfully managing your stress levels can help control your symptoms.\nWays you can reduce stress include:\n\nlearning relaxation techniques, such as\u00a0deep breathing exercises, meditation and yoga\ntaking regular exercise\n\nAs strenuous exercise can sometimes make rosacea symptoms worse, a low-intensity exercise programme, such as walking or swimming, may be better than high-intensity activities, such as running or aerobics.\nRead\u00a0about stress management.\nSome of the most\u00a0commonly reported food- and drink-related triggers are alcohol and spicy foods. You may want to try completely removing these from your diet to see if your rosacea improves.\nBut\u00a0there are many other dietary triggers that can also affect some people with rosacea.\nIt's a good idea to include information about how your diet affects your rosacea symptoms in\u00a0your rosacea diary.\nCovering your face and nose with a scarf can help protect your skin from cold temperatures and wind.\nIf you need to spend considerable time outside during cold weather, protect your face\u00a0with a balaclava.\nSkincare techniques\nThe advice below about skincare techniques may also help control your rosacea symptoms.\n\nClean your skin every morning and evening using a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser. Use soap-free cleansers with non-alkaline or neutral pH. Avoid scented soaps and alcohol-based skin cleansers\nRinse your face with lukewarm water and allow skin to dry thoroughly before you apply medication or make-up\nLook for products suitable for sensitive skin. These are usually described as mild, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free and non-comedogenic (will not block pores)\nUse a moisturiser to soothe skin if it feels sore\nAvoid oil-based or waterproof cosmetics requiring solvents for removal. Use water-based make-up and skin products\u00a0instead\nAvoid astringents, toners and other facial or hair products that contain ingredients that might irritate your skin, such as fragrances, alcohol, menthol, witch hazel,\u00a0eucalyptus oil, camphor, clove oil, peppermint, sodium lauryl sulphate and lanolin\nYou may want to avoid using anything on your skin that you aren't sure of. You can then gradually\u00a0reintroduce products once your symptoms have been treated and cleared to see if you can use them again without any problems\nMen may find that using an electric razor, rather than a blade, helps reduce skin irritation\nSome people find regular gentle facial massage reduces swelling (lymphoedema)\nDon't use steroid cream unless you're specifically instructed to by your GP, as it may make your symptoms worse\n\nSkin camouflage\u00a0\nIt may be possible to disguise patches of persistent red skin using specially designed camouflage make-up.\nThe charity Changing Faces offers a skin camouflage service, available nationally and free of charge, to help with the use of these creams.\nYour GP or dermatologist can refer you to the skin camouflage service and prescribe skin camouflage make-up.\nEyelid hygiene\nIf your eyelids are inflamed as a result of rosacea (blepharitis), cleaning your eyelids every day with\u00a0warm water and a small amount of cleaning solution can help ease your symptoms.\nAvoiding\u00a0eye make-up can also help reduce your symptoms, but if you do choose to\u00a0wear eye make-up, make sure it is a type that washes off easily so you can still clean your eyelids.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin.\nThe main symptom of scabies is intense\u00a0itching that's worse at night. It also causes a\u00a0skin rash on areas where the mites have burrowed.\nRead more about the symptoms of scabies.\nScabies mites\nScabies mites are called Sarcoptes scabiei. They feed using their mouths and front legs to burrow into the outer layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs.\nAfter 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults.\nScabies like warm places, such as skin folds, between the fingers, under fingernails, or around the buttock or breast creases. They can also hide under watch straps, bracelets or rings.\nRead more about the life cycle of the scabies mite.\nHow scabies is spread\nScabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact.\nIt's also possible\u00a0\u2013 but rare\u00a0\u2013 for scabies to be passed on by sharing clothing, towels and bedding with someone who's infected.\nIt can take up to 8\u00a0weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after the initial infection. This is known as the incubation period.\nRead more about the causes of scabies.\nScabies outbreaks\nScabies is widespread in densely populated\u00a0areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas:\n\nAfrica\nCentral and South America\nnorthern and central Australia\nCaribbean Islands\nIndia\nsoutheast Asia\n\nIn developed countries, scabies outbreaks can sometimes occur in places where there are lots of people, such as schools, nurseries and\u00a0care homes.\nIn the UK, most outbreaks of scabies occur in the winter. This may be because people tend to spend more time indoors and closer to each other at this time of year.\nIt's difficult to know exactly how many cases of scabies there are in the UK. This is because many people don't visit their GP and treat the condition with non-prescription medicines.\nTreating scabies\nVisit\u00a0your GP if you think\u00a0you have scabies.\u00a0It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.\nThe 2\u00a0most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and\u00a0malathion lotion (brand name Derbac M).\u00a0Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite.\nPermethrin 5% cream is usually recommended as the first treatment. Malathion 0.5% lotion is used if permethrin\u00a0is ineffective.\nIf your partner\u00a0has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearest\u00a0sexual health clinic so you can be checked\u00a0and, if necessary, treated.\nAvoid having sex and other forms of close bodily\u00a0contact until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment.\nRead more about\u00a0diagnosing scabies\u00a0and treating scabies.\nComplications of scabies\nScabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching.\nCrusted scabies is a\u00a0rare but more severe form of scabies, where\u00a0a large number of\u00a0mites are in the skin. This can develop in\u00a0older people and those with a lowered immunity.\nRead more about complications\u00a0of scabies.\n\n\nThe main symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a rash in areas of the body where the mites have burrowed.\nThe\u00a0itching is often worse at night, when your skin is warmer.\u00a0It may take 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks before the itching starts because this is how long it takes for the body to react to mite droppings.\nSymptoms will start within 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0days if you've had a scabies\u00a0infection in the past. This is because your immune system will have learned to respond to a scabies infection.\nWhat does a scabies rash look like?\nThe scabies\u00a0rash consists of tiny red\u00a0spots. Scratching the rash may cause crusty sores to develop.\nBurrow marks can be found anywhere on the body. They're short (1cm or less), wavy, silver-coloured lines on the skin, with a black dot at one end that can be seen with a magnifying glass.\nWhere does a scabies rash develop?\nIn adults, burrow marks often appear in the following areas:\n\nthe folds of skin between\u00a0fingers and toes\nthe palms of the hands\nthe soles and sides of the feet\u00a0\nthe wrists\nthe elbows\naround the\u00a0nipples (in women)\naround the genital area (in men)\u00a0\n\nThe rash usually affects the whole body, apart from the head.\u00a0The following areas can be particularly affected:\n\nthe underarm area\naround the waist\nthe inside of the elbow\nthe lower buttocks\nthe lower legs\nthe soles of the feet\nthe\u00a0knees\nthe shoulder blades\nthe female genital area\nthe groin\naround the ankles\n\nElderly people, young children and those with a low immune system (immunocompromised) may also develop a rash on their head and neck.\nMen usually have 1\u00a0or more very itchy, lumpy, 3 to 10mm spots on the skin of the genitals (on the penis\u00a0and scrotum).\u00a0\nIn infants and young children, burrow marks tend to appear in different\u00a0places on their body, including on\u00a0the:\n\nface\nhead\nneck\nscalp\npalms of the hands\nsoles of the feet\n\nScabies mites leave small red blotches and silver-coloured lines on the skin. These marks are caused by the mites burrowing into the skin.\nIn infants with scabies, blisters and pustules (small blisters that contain pus) may develop on\u00a0the soles of the feet and palms of the hands.\n\n\nScabies is a skin condition caused by the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei.\nThe intense\u00a0itching associated with scabies is thought to be caused by the immune system reacting to the mites and their saliva, eggs and faeces.\nThe scabies mite life cycle\nA scabies infestation starts when a female mite burrows into your skin.\nMale mites move between different burrow sites looking to mate. After mating, the male mite dies and the female begins to lay eggs, which\u00a0hatch around 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0days later.\nAfter hatching, the young mites move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults after 10 to 15 days. Male mites stay on the surface of the skin, while\u00a0female mites burrow back into the skin to create a new burrow. The life cycle is then repeated.\nWithout effective treatment, the life cycle of the scabies mite can continue indefinitely. Scabies mites are resistant to soap and hot water and can't be scrubbed out of the skin.\nHow scabies is spread\nScabies mites can't fly or jump, which means they can only move from one human body to another if 2\u00a0people have direct and prolonged physical contact.\nFor example, scabies mites can be transmitted by:\n\nholding hands with an\u00a0infected person for a prolonged period of time\nhaving sex with an\u00a0infected person\u00a0\nsharing\u00a0clothing, towels and bedding with an infected person (although\u00a0this is rare)\n\nIt's unlikely that scabies will be transmitted through brief physical contact, such as shaking hands or hugging.\nScabies mites can survive outside the human body for 24 to 36 hours, making infection by coming into contact with contaminated clothes, towels\u00a0or bed linen a possibility. However, it's\u00a0rare for someone to be infected in this way.\nScabies infestations can spread quickly because people are usually unaware\u00a0they\u00a0have the condition until 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0weeks after the initial infection.\nThere's an increased risk of catching scabies in confined environments, such as schools and nursing homes, where people are in close proximity to one another.\n\n\nYour GP should be able to diagnose scabies from the appearance of your skin, and by looking for the burrow marks of the Sarcoptes scabiei mite.\nHowever, as scabies\u00a0is spread very easily, it's often possible to make a confident diagnosis if more than one family member has the same symptoms.\nYour GP will also want to rule out other skin conditions that may be causing your symptoms, such as eczema or impetigo (a highly contagious bacterial skin infection).\nRead more about the symptoms of scabies.\nInk test\nThe burrows of scabies mites can be identified by using an ink test. Ink is rubbed around an area of itchy skin before being wiped off with an alcohol pad.\nIf scabies burrows are present, some of the ink will remain and will have tracked into the burrows, showing up as a dark line.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, a skin sample may be gently scraped from the affected area so\u00a0it can be examined under a microscope for evidence of scabies mites, their eggs and faeces (poo).\nWhere to get help with scabies\nVisit your GP if you think you have scabies. If you think you have genital scabies or your partner has been diagnosed with it, visit your nearest sexual health clinic, where you'll be examined and, if necessary, treated.\nIf you decide to treat scabies yourself, you'll need to have a full sexual health check to make sure you don't have any\u00a0sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nTo prevent reinfection, it's important that all members of your household are treated, as well as any sexual partners you've had over the last 6\u00a0weeks (in the case of genital scabies). If you've had genital scabies in the past, anyone you've had sex with in the previous 48 hours will need to be treated.\nIf you're embarrassed about contacting previous sexual partners, your GP surgery or local sexual health clinic may be able to inform them that they've been exposed to scabies on your behalf without disclosing your identity.\nSexual health clinics\nSome sexual health clinics operate on a walk-in basis. Others work by\u00a0appointment only. It's therefore a good idea to call first.\nWhen you attend a clinic, you'll be asked for your name, date of birth and contact details. These details will be treated confidentially and won't be passed on to your GP without your agreement.\nYou'll also be asked about your sexual history, including:\n\nwhen you last had sex\nwhether you used condoms\nwhether you've had an STI in the past\u00a0\nwhether you're taking any medication\n\nIf you're attending a clinic for scabies, you may also be offered tests for STIs.\n\n\nSee your GP immediately if you have scabies and you haven't had a previous infection. Delaying treatment places other people at risk.\nAs other more serious skin conditions can sometimes cause similar symptoms to the symptoms of scabies, your GP will need to rule these out.\nIf you have scabies, your partner will also need to be treated regardless of whether or not they have any symptoms. This is because it's highly likely that scabies will have been transmitted through close bodily contact, such as during\u00a0sex.\nTo reduce the risk of reinfection, avoid having sex and other forms of prolonged close bodily contact, such as holding hands,\u00a0until both you and your partner have completed\u00a0the\u00a0full course of treatment.\nIf you've been diagnosed with scabies, you may be advised to visit your nearest sexual health clinic\u00a0to be checked and, if necessary, treated for other\u00a0sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nLotions and creams\nLotions and creams are commonly used to treat scabies. Your GP, pharmacist or nurse will be able to advise you about which treatment to use.\nTo prevent reinfection, all members of your household and any close contacts, including recent sexual partners, should be\u00a0treated at the same time as you, even if they don't have any symptoms.\nThe cream or lotion should be applied to the\u00a0skin of\u00a0all of your body, except your head.\u00a0Before you apply it, make sure your skin is\u00a0cool and dry. Don't apply it after having a hot bath.\nIf you apply it when your body is hot, it will quickly be absorbed into your skin and won't remain on the area where the scabies burrows are.\nWhen using a cream or lotion to treat scabies, you should also:\n\nread the patient leaflet that comes with the cream or lotion for details of where to apply it - some products need to be applied to the whole body, including the scalp and face, whereas others must only be applied from the neck down\npay particular attention to difficult-to-reach areas, like your back, the soles of your feet, in between your fingers and toes, under fingernails, and on your genitals\nuse a cotton bud or old toothbrush to apply the treatment under fingernails and toenails - put the cotton bud or toothbrush in a bag and throw it away afterwards\nleave the treatment on your skin for 8 to 24 hours (depending on the preparation used) before washing it off thoroughly - follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding how long to leave the cream or lotion on for\nreapply the cream or lotion immediately to any areas of skin that are washed during the period of application\nwash bed linen, nightwear and towels after the first application\nrepeat the treatment process 7 days after the first application to ensure it's successful - the second application will ensure any mites hatched from existing eggs are killed\n\nIt can take a month after treatment for the general itching to subside completely, and longer for the lumpy genital lesions to resolve. Your GP may recommend repeating the\u00a0treatment or they may prescribe a different lotion.\nManaging a scabies infection\nOn the day you first apply the cream or lotion, you should\u00a0wash all bed linen, nightwear\u00a0and towels at\u00a0a temperature above 50C (122F).\nIf you're unable to wash certain items,\u00a0place them in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. After this time, the scabies\u00a0mites will have died.\nIn cases of crusted scabies, you should clean\u00a0the floors in your house and thoroughly vacuum your carpets\u00a0and furniture, including the armchairs and sofa.\nIf you've been diagnosed with scabies,\u00a0avoid close and prolonged physical contact with others until you've applied the cream or lotion. You should also\u00a0avoid close contact with other members of your household until their treatment has been completed.\nChildren and adults can return to school or work after the first treatment\u00a0has been completed.\nTreating the itch\nYour GP should be able to prescribe treatments, such as a mild steroid cream,\u00a0to reduce the itchiness. Menthol cream or gel, available\u00a0from pharmacies without a prescription, may also\u00a0help relieve itchy skin.\nOral\u00a0sedative antihistamines are also available from your local pharmacy and can be used to control itching and help you get a better night's sleep.\nAs this type of antihistamine can cause drowsiness, you should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you're affected in this way.\nNon-sedating antihistamines don't help relieve the itching of scabies.\u00a0Check with your GP or pharmacist\u00a0if you're\u00a0unsure.\nYou may continue to experience itchiness for a couple of weeks after your treatment has been completed. This is because your immune system will still be reacting to the presence of dead mites and their droppings.\nVisit your GP if you're still experiencing itchiness 6\u00a0weeks after completing\u00a0your treatment.\n\n\nA secondary infection and crusted scabies are 2\u00a0possible complications of scabies.\nSecondary infection\nRepeatedly scratching\u00a0itchy skin\u00a0caused by\u00a0scabies may break the skin's surface. This will\u00a0make you\u00a0more vulnerable to developing a bacterial skin infection, such as\u00a0impetigo.\nAntibiotics may be recommended to control a secondary infection.\nScabies has been known to\u00a0make some pre-existing skin conditions, such as eczema,\u00a0worse. However, other skin conditions should settle down after\u00a0the scabies infection has been successfully treated.\nCrusted scabies\nCrusted scabies, also known as Norwegian scabies, is a more severe form of scabies. This means thousands or even millions of scabies mites are present.\nNormal scabies can develop into crusted scabies\u00a0after a skin reaction. The condition affects all parts of the body, including your head, neck, nails and scalp. However, unlike normal scabies, the rash associated with crusted scabies usually doesn't itch.\nIn crusted scabies, the increase in the number of mites causes thick, warty crusts to develop on the skin. It's often mistaken for psoriasis (a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales).\nCrusted scabies affects people with a weakened immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and\u00a0illness). This includes:\n\nthe very young\npeople with brain disorders (neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease)\npeople with Down's syndrome\npregnant women\nelderly people\npeople with a condition that affects their immune system, such as\u00a0HIV or AIDs\npeople who are taking steroids to treat other medical conditions\npeople who are having\u00a0chemotherapy treatment\n\nResearch has found a healthy immune system appears to interrupt the reproductive cycle of the scabies mite. For example, most people with scabies will only have 5 to 15 mites on their body at any one time.\nHowever, if you have a weakened immune system, the number of scabies mites can increase significantly. People with crusted scabies can have thousands or millions of scabies mites on their body at any one time.\nBecause of\u00a0the high number of scabies mites, crusted scabies is highly contagious. Even minimal physical contact with a person with crusted scabies, or with their bed linen or clothes, can lead to infection.\nHowever, contact with\u00a0someone with crusted scabies will\u00a0only lead to the normal type of scabies in people with a healthy immune system.\nCrusted scabies can be treated using insecticide creams or a medicine called ivermectin, which is taken by swallowing a tablet. Ivermectin kills the mites by stopping their nervous system working.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms, including:\n\nhallucinations\u00a0\u2013 hearing or seeing things that do not exist\ndelusions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0unusual beliefs not based on reality that often contradict the evidence\nmuddled thoughts based on hallucinations or delusions\nchanges in behaviour\n\nDoctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness.\u00a0This means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality.\nRead more about the symptoms of schizophrenia.\nWhy does schizophrenia happen?\nThe exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown.

About\u00a01 in 100 people will experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with many continuing to lead normal lives.\nSchizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Men and women are affected\u00a0equally.\nThere is no single test for schizophrenia. It is most often diagnosed after an assessment by a mental health care professional, such as a psychiatrist.\nIt is important that schizophrenia is diagnosed as early as possible, as the chances of recovery improve the earlier it is treated.\nRead more about diagnosing schizophrenia.\nHow is schizophrenia treated?\nSchizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medication and therapy\u00a0appropriate to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic\u00a0medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).\nPeople with schizophrenia will usually receive help from a community mental health team (CMHT), which will offer day-to-day support and treatment.\nMany people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have periods when symptoms return (relapses). Support and treatment can help\u00a0reduce the impact\u00a0the condition has\u00a0on your life.\nRead more about treating schizophrenia.\nLiving with schizophrenia\nIf schizophrenia is well managed, it is possible to reduce the chances of severe relapses. This can include:\n\nrecognising the signs of an acute episode\ntaking medication as prescribed\ntalking to others about the condition\n\nThere are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people\u00a0find it comforting\u00a0talking to others with a similar condition.\nRead more about living with schizophrenia.\n\n\nChanges in thinking and behaviour are the most obvious signs of schizophrenia, but people can experience symptoms in different ways.\nThe symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into one of two categories\u00a0\u2013\u00a0positive or negative.\n\npositive symptoms \u2013 represent a change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions\nnegative symptoms \u2013 represent a withdrawal or lack of function that you would usually expect to see in a healthy person; for example, people with schizophrenia often appear emotionless, flat and apathetic\n\nThe condition\u00a0may develop slowly. The first signs of schizophrenia, such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or experiencing changes in sleeping patterns, can be hard to identify. This is because the first symptoms often develop during adolescence and changes can be mistaken for an adolescent \"phase\".\nPeople often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they experience few or no positive symptoms. This is known as acute schizophrenia.\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible.\u00a0The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.\nRead more information about how schizophrenia is diagnosed.\nPositive symptoms of schizophrenia\nA hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is\u00a0nothing or\u00a0nobody there to account for it. It can involve any of the senses, but the most common is hearing voices.\nHallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them\u00a0cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations.\nResearch using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people\u00a0with schizophrenia\u00a0when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices.\nSome people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they are rude, critical, abusive or\u00a0annoying. The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer's thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or\u00a0one place in particular, such as the television.\nA delusion is a belief\u00a0held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way people behave. Delusions can begin suddenly, or may develop over weeks or months.\nSome people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they are having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions.\nSomeone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe\u00a0they are being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they are being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend.\nSome people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. They may believe\u00a0people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street.\nPeople experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme.\nPeople sometimes describe their thoughts as \"misty\" or \"hazy\" when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand.\nA person's behaviour may become more disorganised and unpredictable, and their appearance or dress may seem unusual to others. People with schizophrenia may behave inappropriately or become extremely agitated and shout or swear for no reason.\nSome people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else.\nAnother recognised feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions.\nNegative symptoms of schizophrenia\nThe negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often\u00a0appear several years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode. These initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia.\nSymptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse. They include becoming more socially withdrawn and experiencing an increasing lack of care about your appearance and personal hygiene.\nIt can be difficult to tell whether the symptoms are part of the development of schizophrenia or caused by something else. Negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia include:\n\nlosing interest and motivation in life and activities, including relationships and sex\u00a0\nlack of concentration, not wanting to leave the house, and changes in sleeping patterns\u00a0\nbeing less likely to initiate conversations and feeling uncomfortable with people, or feeling there is nothing to say\n\nThe negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often lead to relationship problems with friends and family because they can sometimes be mistaken for deliberate laziness or rudeness.\n\n\nThe exact causes of schizophrenia are unknown, but research suggests that a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make people more likely to develop the condition.\nCurrent thinking is that some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or emotional life event might trigger a psychotic episode. However, it's not known why some people develop symptoms while others don't.\nIncreased risk\nThings that increase the chances of schizophrenia developing include:\nSchizophrenia tends to run in families, but no\u00a0one gene is thought to be responsible. It's more likely\u00a0that different combinations of genes make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn't necessarily mean you will develop schizophrenia.\nEvidence the disorder is partly inherited comes from studies of twins. Identical twins share the same genes. In\u00a0identical twins, if one twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has a one in two chance of developing it too. This is true even if they are raised separately.\u00a0\nIn non-identical twins, who have different genetic make-ups, when one twin develops schizophrenia, the other only has a one in seven chance of developing the condition.\nWhile this is higher than in the general population (where the chance is about 1 in a 100), it suggests genes are not the only factor influencing the development of schizophrenia.\nStudies of people with schizophrenia have shown there are subtle differences in the structure of their brains. These changes aren't seen in everyone with schizophrenia and\u00a0can occur in people who don't have a mental illness. But they suggest\u00a0schizophrenia may partly be a disorder of the brain.\nThese are chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. There is a connection between neurotransmitters and schizophrenia because drugs that alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain are known to relieve some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.\u00a0\nResearch suggests\u00a0schizophrenia may be caused by a change in the level of two neurotransmitters: dopamine and serotonin. Some studies indicate\u00a0an imbalance between the two may be the basis of the problem. Others have found a change in the body's sensitivity to the neurotransmitters is part of the cause of schizophrenia.\nResearch has shown that people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced complications before and during their birth, such as a low birth weight, premature labour, or a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during birth. It may be that these things have a subtle effect on brain development.\nTriggers\nTriggers are things that can cause schizophrenia to develop in people who are at risk. These include:\nThe main psychological triggers of schizophrenia are stressful life events, such as a bereavement, losing your job or home, a divorce or the end of a relationship, or physical, sexual, emotional or racial abuse. These kinds of experiences, though stressful, do not cause schizophrenia, but can trigger its development in someone already vulnerable to it.\nDrugs do not directly cause schizophrenia, but studies have shown drug misuse increases the risk of developing schizophrenia or a similar illness.\nCertain drugs, particularly cannabis, cocaine, LSD\u00a0or amphetamines, may trigger symptoms of schizophrenia in people who are susceptible. Using amphetamines or cocaine can lead to psychosis and can cause a relapse in people recovering from an earlier episode.\nThree major studies have shown teenagers under 15 who use cannabis regularly, especially \"skunk\" and other more potent forms of the drug, are up to four times more likely to develop schizophrenia by the age of 26.\nWant to know more?\n\nMind: mental health effects of street drugs\nMind:\u00a0what causes schizophrenia?\nRethink Mental Illness: causes of schizophrenia\nRoyal College of Psychiatrists: cannabis and mental health\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nThere is no single test for schizophrenia. The condition is usually diagnosed after assessment by a specialist in mental health.\nIf you are concerned\u00a0you may be developing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and check they are not the result of other causes, such as recreational drug use.\nCommunity mental health team (CMHT)\nIf a diagnosis of schizophrenia is suspected, your GP should refer you promptly to your local community mental health team (CMHT).\nCMHTs are made up of different mental health professionals who support people with complex mental health conditions.\nA member of the CMHT team, usually a psychiatrist or a specialist nurse, will carry out a more detailed assessment of your symptoms. They will also want to know your personal history and current circumstances.\nTo make a diagnosis, most mental healthcare professionals use a diagnostic checklist. Schizophrenia can usually be diagnosed if:\n\nyou have experienced one or more of the following symptoms most of the time for a month\u00a0\u2013\u00a0delusions, hallucinations,\u00a0hearing voices, incoherent speech\u00a0or negative symptoms, such as a flattening of emotions\nyour symptoms have had a significant impact on your ability to work, study or perform daily tasks\nall other possible causes, such as recreational drug use or bipolar disorder, have been ruled out\n\nRelated illnesses\nSometimes it might not be clear whether someone has schizophrenia. If you have other symptoms at the same time, a psychiatrist may have reason to believe you have a related mental illness.\nThere are several\u00a0related mental illnesses similar to schizophrenia. Your psychiatrist will ask\u00a0how your illness has affected you so they can confidently confirm you have schizophrenia and not another mental illness, such as:\n\nbipolar disorder (manic depression) \u2013\u00a0people with bipolar disorder swing from periods of mania (elevated moods and extremely active, excited behaviour) to periods of deep depression; some people also hear voices or experience other kinds of hallucinations, or may have delusions\nschizoaffective disorder \u2013\u00a0this is often described as a form of schizophrenia because its symptoms are similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness in its own right; it may occur just once in a person's life or\u00a0recur intermittently, often when triggered by stress.\n\nYou should also be assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions,\u00a0such\u00a0as\u00a0depression, anxiety and substance misuse.\u00a0\nGetting help for someone else\nAs a result of\u00a0their delusional thought patterns, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there is nothing wrong with them.\nIt is likely\u00a0someone who has had acute schizophrenic episodes in the past will have been assigned a care co-ordinator. If this is the case, contact the person's care co-ordinator to express your concerns.\nIf someone is having an acute schizophrenic episode for the first time, it may be necessary for a friend, relative or other loved one to persuade them to visit their GP.\nIn the case of a rapidly worsening schizophrenic episode, you may need to go to the accident and emergency (A&E) department, where a duty psychiatrist will be available.\nIf a person who is having an acute schizophrenic episode refuses to seek help, their nearest relative can request that a mental health assessment is carried out. The social services department of your local authority can advise\u00a0how to do this.\nIn severe cases of schizophrenia, people can be compulsorily detained in hospital for assessment and treatment\u00a0under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015.\nAfter diagnosis\nIf you or a friend or relative are diagnosed with schizophrenia, you may feel anxious about what will happen. You may be worried about the stigma attached to the condition, or feel frightened and withdrawn.\nIt is important to remember that a diagnosis can be a positive step towards getting good, straightforward information about the illness and the kinds of treatment and services available.\n\n\nCommunity mental health teams\nMost people with schizophrenia are treated by community mental health teams (CMHTs). The goal of the CMHT is to provide\u00a0day-to-day support and treatment while ensuring you have as much independence as possible.\nA CMHT can be made up of and provide access to:\n\nsocial workers\ncommunity mental health nurses\u00a0\u2013 a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions\noccupational therapists\npharmacists\ncounsellors and psychotherapists\u00a0\npsychologists and psychiatrists\u00a0\u2013 the psychiatrist is usually the senior clinician in the team\n\nAfter your first episode of schizophrenia, you should initially be referred to an early intervention team.\u00a0These specialist teams provide treatment and support, and are usually made up of psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, social workers and support workers.\nCare programme approach (CPA)\nPeople with complex mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia, are usually entered into a treatment process known as a care programme approach (CPA). A CPA is essentially a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs.\nThere are four stages to a CPA:\n\nassessment \u2013 your health and social needs are assessed\ncare plan \u2013\u00a0a care plan is created to meet your health and social needs\ncare co-ordinator\u00a0appointed \u2013 a\u00a0care co-ordinator, sometimes known as a key worker, is usually a social worker or nurse, and is your first point of contact with other members of the CMHT\nreviews \u2013\u00a0your treatment will be regularly reviewed and, if needed, changes to the care plan can be agreed\n\nNot everyone uses the CPA. Some people may be cared for by their GP, while others may be under the care of a specialist.\nYou will work together with your healthcare team to develop a care plan. The care plan may involve an advance statement or crisis plan, which can be followed in an emergency.\nYour care plan should include\u00a0a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme and, if you smoke,\u00a0support\u00a0for giving up.\u00a0\u00a0\nYour care co-ordinator will be responsible for making sure all members of your healthcare team, including your GP, have a copy of your care plan.\nWant to know more?\n\nRethink Mental Illness: Care programme approach fact sheet (PDF, 483kb)\n\nAcute episodes\nPeople who have serious psychotic symptoms as\u00a0the result of an acute schizophrenic episode may require a more intensive level of care than a CMHT can provide.\nThese episodes are usually dealt with by antipsychotic medication and special care.\nCrisis resolution teams (CRT)\nOne treatment option is to contact a home treatment or crisis resolution team (CRT). CRTs treat people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric crisis. Without the involvement of the CRT, these people would require treatment in hospital.\nThe CRT aims to treat people in the least restrictive environment possible, ideally in or near their home. This can be in your own home, in a dedicated crisis residential home or hostel, or in a day care centre.\nCRTs are also responsible for planning aftercare once the crisis has passed to prevent a further crisis from occurring.\nYour care co-ordinator should be able to provide you and your friends or family with contact information in the event of a crisis.\nVoluntary and compulsory detention\nMore serious acute schizophrenic episodes may require admission to a psychiatric ward at a hospital or clinic. You can admit yourself voluntarily to hospital if your psychiatrist agrees it is necessary.\nPeople can also be compulsorily detained at a hospital under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015. It is only possible for someone to be compulsorily detained at a hospital if they have a severe mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, and if detention is necessary:\u00a0\n\nin the interests of the person's own health and safety\nto\u00a0protect others\n\nPeople with schizophrenia who are compulsorily detained may need to be kept in locked wards.\nAll people being treated in hospital will stay only as long as is absolutely necessary\u00a0for them to\u00a0receive appropriate treatment and arrange aftercare.\nAn independent panel will regularly review your case and progress. Once they feel you are no longer a danger to yourself and others, you will be discharged from hospital. However, your care team may recommend\u00a0you remain in hospital voluntarily.\nAdvance statements\nIf it is felt there is a significant risk of future acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, you may want to write an advance statement.\nAn advance statement is a series of written instructions about what you would like your family or friends to do in case you experience another acute schizophrenic episode. You may also want to include\u00a0contact details for your care co-ordinator.\nIf you want to make an advance statement, talk to your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP.\nWant to know more?\n\nMind: community care and aftercare\u00a0\n\nAntipsychotics\nAntipsychotics are usually recommended as the initial treatment for\u00a0the symptoms of an acute schizophrenic episode. They work by blocking the effect\u00a0of the chemical dopamine\u00a0on the brain.\nAntipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but\u00a0may take several days or weeks to reduce other symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.\nIt's important that your doctor gives you a thorough physical examination before you start taking antipsychotics, and that you work together to find the right one for you.\nAntipsychotics can be taken orally (as a pill) or given as an injection (known as a depot). Several slow-release antipsychotics are available.\u00a0These require you to have\u00a0one injection every two to four weeks.\nYou may only need\u00a0antipsychotics until your acute schizophrenic episode has passed. However, most people take medication for one or two years after their first psychotic episode to prevent further acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, and for longer if the illness is recurrent.\nThere are two main types of antipsychotics:\n\ntypical antipsychotics \u2013 the first generation of antipsychotics\u00a0developed during the 1950s\natypical antipsychotics \u2013 newer-generation antipsychotics\u00a0developed in the 1990s\n\nThe choice of antipsychotic should be made following a discussion between you and your psychiatrist about the likely benefits and side effects.\nBoth typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them and the severity will differ from person to person.\nThe side effects of typical antipsychotics include:\n\nshaking\ntrembling\nmuscle twitches\nmuscle spasms\n\nSide effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics include:\n\ndrowsiness\u00a0\nweight gain, particularly with some atypical antipsychotics\nblurred vision\nconstipation\nlack of sex drive\ndry mouth\n\nTell your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist\u00a0or GP if your side effects become severe. There may be an alternative antipsychotic you can take or additional medicines\u00a0that will help you deal with the side effects.\nIf you do not benefit from one antipsychotic medication after taking it regularly for several weeks, an alternative can be tried. It is important that you work with your treatment team to find the right one for you.\nDo not stop taking your antipsychotics without first consulting your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP.\u00a0If you stop taking them,\u00a0you could\u00a0have a relapse of symptoms.\nYour medication should be reviewed at least once a year.\nWant to know more?\n\nMind: antipsychotics\u00a0\nRoyal College of Psychiatrists: depot medication\n\nPsychological treatment\nPsychological treatment can help people with schizophrenia cope with the symptoms of hallucinations or delusions better. They can also help treat some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy or a lack of enjoyment.\nPsychological treatments for schizophrenia work best when they are combined with antipsychotic medication. Common psychological treatments include:\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you identify the thinking patterns that are causing you to have unwanted feelings and behaviour, and learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and useful thoughts.\nFor example, you may be taught to recognise examples of delusional thinking. You may then receive help and advice about how to avoid acting on these thoughts.\nMost people will require\u00a0between 8 and 20 sessions of CBT over the space of\u00a06 to 12 months. CBT sessions usually last for about an hour.\nYour GP or care co-ordinator should be able to arrange a referral to a CBT therapist.\nFamily therapy\nMany people with schizophrenia rely on family members for their care and support. While most family members are happy to help, caring for somebody with schizophrenia can place a strain on any family.\nFamily therapy is a way of helping you and your family cope better with your condition. It involves a series of informal meetings\u00a0over a period of around six months. Meetings may include:\n\ndiscussing information about schizophrenia\nexploring ways of supporting somebody with schizophrenia\ndeciding how to solve practical problems that can be caused by the symptoms of schizophrenia\n\nIf you think you and your family could benefit from family therapy, speak to\u00a0your care co-ordinator or GP.\nArts therapy\nArts therapies are designed to promote creative expression. Working with an arts therapist in a small group or individually can allow you to express your experiences with schizophrenia.\nSome people find expressing things in a non-verbal way through the arts can provide a new experience of schizophrenia and help them develop new ways of relating to others.\nArts therapies have been shown to alleviate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in some people.\nNICE recommends\u00a0that arts therapies are provided by an arts therapist\u00a0registered with the\u00a0Health and Care Professions Council who has experience of working with people with schizophrenia.\nWant to know more?\n\nMind: understanding talking treatments\n\n\n\nAs well as monitoring your mental health, your healthcare team and GP should monitor your physical health.\nA healthy lifestyle,\u00a0including a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and regular exercise, is good for you and can reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. You should also try to avoid too much stress and get a proper amount of sleep.\nYou should have a check-up with your GP at least once a year to monitor your risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes. This will include recording your weight, checking your blood pressure, and any appropriate blood tests.\nStop smoking\nRates of smoking\u00a0in people with schizophrenia are three times higher than in the general population. If you are a smoker, you are at a higher risk of developing cancer, heart disease and stroke.\nStopping smoking has clear physical health benefits but it has also been shown to improve the mental health of people with schizophrenia.\nResearch has shown you are up to four times more likely to quit smoking if you use NHS support as well as stop-smoking medicines, such as patches, gum or inhalators. Ask your doctor about this or phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84.\nIf you take antipsychotic medicines and want to stop smoking it's very important that you talk to your GP and/or psychiatrist before you stop as the dosage of your prescription drugs may need to be monitored and the amount you have to take could be reduced.\nWant to know more?\n\nHealthy eating\nRethink Mental Illness: wellbeing and physical health\nRoyal College of Psychiatrists: smoking and mental health\n\nWho is available to help me?\nIn the course of your treatment for schizophrenia, you will be involved with many different services. Some are accessed through referral from your GP, others through your local authority. These services may include the following:\n\ncommunity mental health teams (CMHTs) \u2013 these provide the main part of local specialist mental health services, and offer assessment, treatment and social care to people living with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses\ntrained peer support \u2013 this involves the support of someone who has had schizophrenia themselves\u00a0and is now stable, and\u00a0may be available\u00a0through your CMHT\nearly intervention teams \u2013 these provide early identification and treatment for people with the first symptoms of psychosis; your GP may be able to refer you directly to an early intervention team\ncrisis services \u2013\u00a0specialist mental health teams that help with crises that occur outside normal office hours and allow people to be treated at home for an acute episode of illness\u00a0instead of in hospital\nacute day hospitals \u2013\u00a0an alternative to inpatient care in a hospital, where you can visit every day or as often as necessary\nassertive outreach teams \u2013 deliver intensive treatment and rehabilitation in the community for people with severe mental health problems and provide rapid help in a crisis situation; staff often visit people at home, act as advocates, liaise with other services (such as your GP or social services), and\u00a0can also help with practical problems (such as helping to find housing and work), and daily tasks (such as shopping and cooking)\nadvocates \u2013 trained and experienced workers who help people communicate their needs or wishes, get impartial information, and represent their views to other people; they can be based in your hospital or mental health support groups, or you can find an independent advocate to act on your behalf\n\nWant to know more?\n\nRethink Mental Illness: treatment and support\n\nEmployment and financial support\nAvoid too much stress, including work-related stress. If you are employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or in a more flexible way.\nUnder the Equality Act 2010, all employers must make reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities, including people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other mental illnesses.\nSeveral\u00a0organisations provide support, training and advice for people with schizophrenia who wish to continue working.\nYour community mental health team is a good first point of contact to find out what services and support are available for you.\nMental health charities such as Mind or Rethink Mental Illness are also an excellent source of information on training and employment.\nIf you are unable to work as a result of your mental illness, you are entitled to financial support, such as Incapacity Benefit.\nWant to know more?\n\nGOV.UK: disability and the Equality Act 2010\nGOV.UK: Incapacity Benefit\nMoney Advice Service\n\nTalk to others\nMany people find it helpful to meet other people with the same experiences for mutual support and to share ideas. It is also an important reminder that you are not alone.\nCharities and support groups allow individuals and families to share experiences and coping strategies, campaign for better services, and provide support. Useful charities, support groups and associations include:\n\nMind\nRethink Mental Illness\nSANE\n\nThere are also other places that offer support to people with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.\nDay centres\nEven if you do not have a job or are unable to work, it is still important to go out and do everyday things and\u00a0give a structure to your week.\nMany people regularly go to a day hospital, day centre or community mental health centre. These offer a range of activities that\u00a0allow you to get active again and spend some time in the company of other people.\nWork projects\nThese provide training to help you develop your work skills and support you back into work. They often have contacts with local employers.\nSupported accommodation\nThis could be a bedsit or flat where there is someone around who is trained to support you and help you deal with day-to-day problems.\nPeer support\nYou may be offered\u00a0the chance to\u00a0meet regularly\u00a0with a trained peer support worker who has recovered from psychosis or schizophrenia themselves.\nWant to know more?\n\nMind: housing rights and mental health\n\nWhat can family, friends and partners do to help?\nFriends, relatives and partners have a vital role in helping people with schizophrenia recover and make a relapse less likely.\nIt is very important not to blame the person with schizophrenia or tell them to \"pull themselves together\", or to blame other people.\u00a0It is important to stay positive and supportive when dealing with a friend or loved one's mental illness.\nAs well as supporting the person with schizophrenia, you may want to get support to cope with your own feelings.\u00a0Several voluntary organisations provide help and support for carers.\nFriends and family should try\u00a0to understand what schizophrenia is, how it affects people, and how they can help.\u00a0You can provide emotional and practical support, and encourage people to seek appropriate support and treatment.\nAs part of someone's treatment, you may be offered family therapy. This can provide information and support for the person with schizophrenia and their family.\nFriends and family can play a major role by monitoring the person's mental state, watching out for any signs of relapse, and encouraging them to take their medication and attend medical appointments.\nIf you are the nearest relative of a person who has schizophrenia, you have certain rights that can be used to protect the patient's interests. These include requesting that the local social services authority ask an approved mental health professional to consider whether the person with schizophrenia should be detained in hospital.\nWant to know more?\n\nMind: how to\u00a0look after yourself as a carer\nRethink Mental Illness: carers hub\n\nDepression and suicide\nMany people with schizophrenia experience periods of depression. Do not ignore these symptoms.\u00a0If\u00a0depression is not treated,\u00a0it can worsen and lead to suicidal thoughts.\nStudies have shown that\u00a0people with schizophrenia have a higher chance of committing suicide. If you have been feeling particularly down over the last month and no longer take pleasure in the things you used to enjoy, you may be depressed. See your GP for advice and treatment.\nImmediately report any suicidal thoughts to your GP or care co-ordinator.\nThe warning signs of suicide\nThe warning signs that people with depression and schizophrenia may be considering suicide include:\n\nmaking final arrangements\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as giving away possessions, making a will or saying goodbye to friends\ntalking about death or suicide\u00a0\u2013 this may be a direct statement such as, \"I wish I was dead\", or indirect phrases such as, \"I think that dead people must be happier than us\", or \"Wouldn't it be nice to go to sleep and never wake up?\"\nself-harm\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as cutting their arms or legs, or burning themselves with cigarettes\na\u00a0sudden lifting of mood\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0could mean a person has decided to commit suicide and feels better because of their decision\n\nHelping a suicidal friend or relative\nIf you see any of these warning signs:\n\nget professional help for the person, such as from a crisis resolution team (CRT) or the duty psychiatrist at your local A&E department\nlet them know they are not alone and you care about them\noffer your support in finding other solutions to their problems\n\nIf you feel there is an immediate danger of the person committing suicide, stay with them or have someone else stay with them.

Young people with scoliosis may also experience some discomfort but it's less likely to be severe.\nSeeking medical advice\nIf you or your child\u00a0have signs of scoliosis, make an appointment to see your GP.\u00a0They can examine your back and can refer you for an X-ray\u00a0for confirmation.\nIf you or your child are diagnosed with scoliosis, it's important to see a scoliosis specialist to talk about treatment options.\nRead more about diagnosing scoliosis.\nWhat causes scoliosis?\nIn around\u00a0eight out of every 10 cases, a cause for scoliosis is not found. This is known as idiopathic scoliosis.\nA small number of cases are caused by other medical conditions, including:\n\ncerebral palsy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition\u00a0 associated with brain damage\nmuscular dystrophy\u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness\u00a0\nMarfan syndrome\u00a0\u2013 a disorder of the connective tissues\n\nRarely, babies can be born with scoliosis,\u00a0as a result of\u00a0a problem with the development of the spine in the womb.\nIn adults, age related changes in the discs and joints of the spine and a reduction in bone density may cause scoliosis. Adults can also experience worsening over time of previously undiagnosed or untreated scoliosis.\nRead more\u00a0about the causes of scoliosis.\nWho is affected\nIt used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it\u2019s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well.\nIt can develop\u00a0at any age, but is most common in children aged 10-15. In the UK, around three or four in every 1,000\u00a0children\u00a0need treatment for scoliosis.\nIt's more common in females than males.\nHow scoliosis is treated\nTreatment for scoliosis depends on your age,\u00a0how severe it is, and whether it\u2019s thought it will worsen with time.\nIn very young children, treatment is not always necessary because the curvature of the spine may improve naturally as they get older. If treatment is necessary, bracing or casting may be used to attempt to halt the curve\u2019s progression.\nIf the infant or younger child's curve continues to progress despite bracing or casting, an operation may be necessary. This will usually involve inserting metal rods into the back to stabilise the spine, which are lengthened at regular intervals as your child grows.\nIn older children and adults, it is unlikely that scoliosis will improve with time, and in some it may progressively worsen.\nThe main treatments for older children are:\n\na back brace worn until they stop growing, to prevent the spine from curving further\nsurgery to correct the curvature \u2013 where the spine is straightened using rods attached to the spine by screws, hooks and/or wires\n\nIn adults, treatment primarily aims to relieve any pain. Non-surgical options, such as painkillers and exercises are often tried first, with correctional surgery seen as a last resort.\nRead more about treating scoliosis in children and treating scoliosis in adults.\nFurther problems\nScoliosis can sometimes lead to\u00a0further emotional and physical problems.\nHaving a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis.\nIf this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, such as Scoliosis Association UK. These groups are a good source of\u00a0information and support for people with scoliosis.\nIn rare cases, scoliosis can lead to physical problems if it's severe. For example, significant curvature of the spine can sometimes put increased pressure on the heart and lungs.\nRead more about the possible complications of scoliosis.\n\n\nIn most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown and it cannot usually be prevented.\nIt is not\u00a0thought to be linked\u00a0with things such as bad posture, exercise or diet.\nIf the cause of scoliosis is unknown,\u00a0it is called idiopathic scoliosis. About eight out of every 10 cases of scoliosis are idiopathic.\nHowever, researchers have found\u00a0there is\u00a0a family history of the condition in some\u00a0idiopathic cases,\u00a0which suggests\u00a0a possible genetic link.\nIdiopathic scoliosis can affect adults and children.\u00a0Some cases\u00a0may only become noticable\u00a0in later life.\nKnown causes\nIn a small number of cases, a cause is identified.\nSome cases of scoliosis are caused by conditions that affect the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular conditions), such as:\n\ncerebral palsy\u00a0\u2013 a condition that\u00a0affects the brain and nerves\u00a0and occurs during or shortly after birth\nmuscular dystrophy\u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness\nneurofibromatosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a\u00a0genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along your nerves\n\nScoliosis can also develop as part of a pattern of symptoms called a syndrome. This is known as syndromic scoliosis. Conditions that can cause syndromic scoliosis include:\n\nMarfan syndrome \u2013 a disorder of the connective tissues inherited by a child from their parents\nRett syndrome \u2013 a genetic disorder, usually affecting females, which causes severe physical and mental disability\n\nThese conditions are usually diagnosed at a young age and children with them are often monitored for problems\u00a0such as\u00a0scoliosis.\nIn rare cases, babies can be born with scoliosis. This is known as congenital scoliosis. Congenital scoliosis is caused by the bones in the spine developing abnormally in the womb.\nIn adults, scoliosis can sometimes be caused by gradual deterioration to the parts of the spine. This is known as degenerative scoliosis.\nThis can occur because some parts of the spine become narrower and weaker (osteoporosis) with age.\n\n\nScoliosis can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination of the spine, ribs, hips and shoulders.\nYou may be asked to bend\u00a0forward to see if any areas are\u00a0particularly prominent. For example, one of your shoulders may be higher than the other or there may be a bulge in your back.\nInitial examinations are usually carried out by a GP. If scoliosis is suspected, you should be referred to an orthopaedic specialist (a specialist in conditions that affect the skeleton) for further tests and to discuss treatment.\nScans\nThe orthopaedic specialist will take an\u00a0X-ray to confirm the diagnosis of scoliosis.\nThe X-ray images will also help determine the shape, direction, location and angle of the curve. The medical name for the angle\u00a0the spine curves\u00a0is known as the Cobb angle.\nIn some cases,\u00a0scans such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0or a\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0may also be recommended.\u00a0\n\n\nIf your child has scoliosis, their treatment will depend on their age and how severe it is.\nThe main treatment options are:\n\nobservation\ncasting\nbracing\nsurgery\n\nThese are described below.\nThere is a separate\u00a0page\u00a0about\u00a0treating scoliosis in adults.\nObservation\nTreatment is not always necessary for very young children because their condition often corrects itself as they grow.\nHowever, if the curve does not correct itself, it can reduce the space for the internal organs to develop in, so careful monitoring by a specialist is important.\nYour specialist will usually recommend having regular\u00a0X-rays to monitor the curvature to see if it improves, stays the same, or gets worse.\nCasting\nIn some cases affecting young children, the spine may need to be guided during growth in an attempt to correct the curve. In a child aged under two years of age, this can sometimes be achieved by using a cast.\nA cast is an external brace to the trunk made out of a lightweight combination of plaster and modern casting materials. The cast is worn constantly and cannot be removed, but is changed regularly to allow for growth and remodelling.\nThe cast will be changed under\u00a0anaesthetic\u00a0every two to three months with the aim of gradually straightening the spine. However, your child may still need to use a removable brace (see below) after treatment.\nBracing\nIf the curve of your child's spine is getting worse, your specialist may recommend they wear a back brace while they are growing. A brace cannot cure scoliosis or correct the curve, but it may stop the curve from getting worse.\nHowever, while there is some evidence bracing may be of benefit in certain cases, it\u2019s not recommended by all scoliosis specialists.\nIf a brace is used, it will need to be carefully fitted to your child's spine. To do this, a cast of your child's back may need to be taken. This can be done as an outpatient which means that your child will not have to stay overnight in hospital.\nBraces are often made of rigid plastic, although flexible braces are sometimes available. In general, modern back braces are designed so they are difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing.\nIt's usually recommended that the brace is worn for 23 hours a day, and is only removed for baths and showers. The brace should not interfere with normal everyday activity and can be worn during most non-contact sports. However, it should be removed during contact sports and swimming.\nRegular exercise is important for children wearing a brace. This helps improve muscle tone and body strength, and will help make wearing the brace more comfortable.\nThe brace will usually have to be worn for as long as your child's body is still growing. For most children, this will mean they can stop wearing it when they are around 16 or 17 years old.\nSurgery\nIf your child has stopped growing and their scoliosis is severe, or other treatments have been unsuccessful, corrective surgery may be recommended. They type of surgery will depend on your child\u2019s age.\nFor younger children, generally those under the age of ten, an operation may be carried out to insert growing rods. These rods aim to allow for continued controlled growth of the spine while partially correcting the scoliosis.\nAfter surgery to insert the rods, your child will need to return to their specialist every 4-6 months to have the rods lengthened to keep up with the child's growth. This procedure will be done through a small incision, and takes place often as a day case or an overnight stay.\nIn some cases, rods that can be lengthened using external magnets during an outpatient appointment may be used. Many children will also have to wear a brace to protect the growth rods.\nWhen your child stops growing, the adjustable rods can be removed and a spinal fusion (see below) will be carried out.\nIn teenagers and young adults whose spine has stopped growing, an operation called a spinal fusion may be carried out.\nThis is a major operation where the spine is straightened using metal rods attached with screws, hooks, and/or wires, and bone grafts are used to fuse the spine in place. This metalwork will usually be left in place permanently, unless they cause any problems.\nThe surgery will take several hours. After surgery, your child will be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU), where they will be given fluids through a vein (intravenously) and pain relief. Most children are well enough to leave intensive care after a day or two, although they will often need to spend another five to 10 days in hospital.\nAfter the operation, most children can return to school after a few weeks and can play sports after a few months. Contact sports should be avoided for 9-12 months. Occasionally a back brace may need to be worn to protect the metal rods after surgery.\nSpinal fusion surgery is a major operation which, like any surgical procedure carries a risk of complications. It will not be recommended unless the surgeon feels the benefits outweigh these risks.\nSome of the main risks the spinal fusion procedure include:\n\nbleeding \u2013 if this is severe your child may need a\u00a0blood transfusion\nwound infection \u2013 this can usually be treated with antibiotics\nthe implants moving or the grafts failing to fuse properly \u2013 additional surgery may be required to correct this\nin rare cases, damage to the nerves in the spine \u2013 this can lead to permanent numbness in the legs, and can sometimes cause paralysis of the legs and loss of control of the bowels and bladder\n\nIt's important that parents and children understand the risks of spinal fusion surgery so that they can make an informed decision about treatment. Make sure you discuss the potential complications with your child's surgeon.\nAdditional therapies\nThere is no reliable evidence to suggest that other therapies such as osteopathy and chiropractic can be used to correct the curvature of the spine or stop it progressing.\nThe role of scoliosis specific exercises is currently under investigation.\nPhysiotherapy\u00a0 may be beneficial when used in combination with a back brace. Exercise can help significantly with any muscular pain experienced with scoliosis, and back health in general.\u00a0\n\n\nBack pain\u00a0is one of the main problems caused by scoliosis in adults, so treatment is mainly aimed at pain relief.\nIn some cases, surgery may be carried out to improve the shape of the spine as a way of helping with back and leg pains.\nMedication\nPainkilling medication is usually recommended\u00a0to help relieve the pain\u00a0that can be associated with scoliosis.\nOver-the-counter painkillers, such as\u00a0paracetamol\u00a0and\u00a0ibuprofen, are often recommended initially. See your GP if these don't work. They may prescribe stronger painkillers or refer you to a specialist pain management clinic.\nIn some cases,\u00a0corticosteroids or\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0may be injected\u00a0into your back to relieve pain caused by the bones in your spine\u00a0compressing or irritating nearby nerves. However, these injections only\u00a0work in the\u00a0short-term and are mostly useful in helping work out where your pain is\u00a0coming\u00a0from.\nIf it's thought that\u00a0osteoporosis of your spine is contributing to your symptoms, you may be given medication and supplements to strengthen your bones.

They also carry a risk of potentially serious complications, including:\n\nfailure\u00a0to reduce\u00a0pain\u00a0\u2013 surgery is generally better at relieving pain that radiates to the legs, rather than back pain\nthe\u00a0implants becoming displaced, broken or loose\ninfection\nblood clots\nrarely, damage\u00a0to the nerves in the spine\u00a0\u2013 in severe cases this can result in\u00a0permanent leg numbness and the loss of bladder or bowel control\n\nRead more about lumbar decompression surgery.\n\n\nPhysical complications of scoliosis are rare, although serious problems can develop if it's left untreated.\nEmotional\u00a0issues\nHaving a visibly curved spine or\u00a0wearing a back brace may cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis.\nModern back braces are designed to be\u00a0difficult to see under loose-fitting clothing, but your child may still worry that they look different or unusual.\nEncouraging your child to talk with other teenagers who have scoliosis can help\u00a0improve their confidence and lessen any feelings they are alone with their condition.\nThere are several support groups, such as the Scoliosis Association UK, that provide information and support for people with scoliosis. Some also host message boards so\u00a0teenagers from across the world can compare experiences, share tips and exchange messages of encouragement.\nLung and heart problems\nIn particularly severe cases of scoliosis the ribcage can be pushed against the heart and lungs, causing breathing problems and making it difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body.\nThis can also increase the chances of lung infections, such as pneumonia, and lead to problems such as heart failure.\nNerve compression\nIn some cases of scoliosis, particularly those affecting adults, the bones in the spine compress nearby nerves. In severe cases, this can cause problems such as:\n\nback and leg pain\nnumbness or weakness in the legs\na loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)\na loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence)\nin men, an inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it. It's caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox.\nIt's estimated that around one in every four people will have at least one episode of shingles during their life.\nSymptoms of shingles\nThe main symptom of shingles\u00a0is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy blisters,\u00a0similar in appearance to chickenpox.\u00a0New blisters may appear for up to a week, but a few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out.\nScabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring.\nThe pain may be\u00a0a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe.\u00a0You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender.\nIn some cases, shingles may cause some early symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash first appears. These early symptoms can include:\n\na\u00a0headache\nburning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area\na feeling of being generally unwell\na high temperature (fever)\n\nAn episode of shingles typically lasts around two to four weeks, however in some cases the pain may last for many weeks once the rash has disappeared. Shingles usually\u00a0affects a specific area on\u00a0one side of the body and doesn't cross over the midline of the body (an imaginary line running from between your eyes down past the belly button).\nAny part of your body can be affected, including your face and eyes, but\u00a0the chest and abdomen (tummy) are the most common areas.\nWhen to get professional advice\nShingles isn\u2019t usually serious, but see your pharmacist as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms. In most cases your pharmacist should be able to provide treatment, however they may recommend that you need to contact your GP practice for treatment if required.\nYou should see your GP if you\u00a0are under 18 years old, pregnant or have a weakened immune system (the body's natural defence system) and you think you have been exposed to someone with chickenpox or shingles and haven't had chickenpox before.\nEarly treatment may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and the risk of developing complications.\nReferral to hospital\nIt's uncommon for someone with shingles to be referred to hospital, but your GP may consider seeking specialist advice if:\n\nthey suspect\u00a0a\u00a0complication of shingles, such as\u00a0meningitis\u00a0or\u00a0encephalitis\nshingles is affecting one of your eyes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0there's a risk\u00a0you could\u00a0develop permanent vision problems if the condition isn't treated quickly\na diagnosis isn't certain\nyou have an unusually persistent case of shingles that's not responding to treatment\nyou've been diagnosed with the condition more than twice\nyou're pregnant\nyou have a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 particularly in severe cases or cases affecting children\n\nCauses of shingles\nMost people have\u00a0chickenpox\u00a0in childhood, but after the illness has gone, the varicella-zoster virus remains dormant (inactive) in the nervous system. The immune system keeps the virus in check, but later in life it can be reactivated and cause shingles.\nIt's possible to have shingles more than once, but it's very rare to get it more than twice.\u00a0\nIt's not known exactly why the shingles virus is reactivated at a later stage in life, but most cases are thought to be caused by\u00a0having lowered immunity (protection against infections and diseases).\nThis may be the result of:\n\nold age \u2013 as you age, your immunity may decrease, and\u00a0shingles most commonly occurs in people over 70 years old\nphysical and emotional\u00a0stress \u2013 the chemicals released by your body when you're stressed can prevent your immune system working properly\nHIV and AIDS\u00a0\u2013 people with HIV are much more likely to get shingles than the rest of the population because their immune system is weak\nrecently having a bone marrow transplant\u00a0\u2013 the conditioning\u00a0you require before the transplant weakens your immune system\nrecently having an organ transplant \u2013 you may need to take medication to suppress your immune system so\u00a0your body accepts the donated organ\nchemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 chemotherapy medication, often used to treat\u00a0cancer, can temporarily weaken your immune system\n\nHowever, young people who appear otherwise healthy can also sometimes develop shingles.\nIs shingles contagious?\nIt's not possible to catch shingles from someone with the condition or from someone with chickenpox. However, you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had\u00a0chickenpox before.\nThe blisters that form contain live virus. If a person who has never had chickenpox makes\u00a0direct contact with an open blister or something with the fluid on it,\u00a0they can contract the virus and develop chickenpox.\nPreventing the spread of the virus\nIf you have shingles, you're contagious until the last blister has dried and scabbed over. To help prevent the virus being passed on,\u00a0avoid sharing towels or flannels, swimming, or playing contact sports.\u00a0You should also avoid work or school if\u00a0your rash is weeping (oozing fluid) and can't be covered.\nChickenpox can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people. If you have shingles, avoid:\n\nwomen who are pregnant and haven't had chickenpox before as they could catch it from you, which may harm their unborn baby\npeople who have a weak immune system, such as someone with HIV or AIDS\nbabies less than one month old, unless it's your own baby, in which case your baby should have antibodies (proteins that fight infection) to protect them from the virus\n\nTreating shingles\nAlthough there's\u00a0no cure for shingles, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms until the condition resolves. Most cases of shingles last around two to four weeks.\nTreatment for shingles can include:\n\ncovering the rash with clothing or a non-adherent (non-stick) dressing to reduce the risk of other people becoming infected with chickenpox - as it's very difficult to pass the virus on to someone else if the rash is covered\npainkilling medication, - such as\u00a0paracetamol,\u00a0ibuprofen\u00a0or codeine\nantiviral medication to stop the virus multiplying -\u00a0although not everyone will need this\n\nRead more about\u00a0treating shingles\nComplications of shingles\nShingles can sometimes lead to complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia. This is where severe nerve pain lasts for several months or more after the rash has gone.\nComplications such as this are usually\u00a0in elderly people who have had the condition and those with a weakened immune system.\nRead more about the\u00a0complications of shingles\nThe shingles vaccine\nIt's not always possible to prevent shingles, but a vaccine called Zostavax can reduce your chances of developing the condition.\nIf you still develop shingles after having this vaccine, it may be milder and last for a shorter time than usual.\nThis vaccine's now routinely offered in Scotland\u00a0as a single injection to people aged\u00a070.\nRead more about\u00a0shingles vaccination\n\u00a0\nRead more about\u00a0shingles vaccination\nOphthalmic shingles\nSome cases of shingles can affect one of the eyes and are known as ophthalmic shingles. This occurs when the virus is reactivated in part of the trigeminal nerve,\u00a0a nerve that controls sensation and movement in your face.\nSymptoms can include:\n\na rash over your forehead, nose and around your eye\nconjunctivitis\u00a0\u2013 inflammation of your eye that causes it to become red and watery with a sticky coating on your eyelashes\na\u00a0red eye\nproblems with your vision\n\n\n\nAn episode of shingles typically lasts around two to four weeks. The main symptoms are pain, followed by a rash.\nAny part of your body can be affected, including your face and eyes, although the chest and abdomen (tummy) are the most common areas where shingles develops.\nEarly symptoms\nIn some cases, shingles may cause some early (prodromal) symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash first appears. These early symptoms can include:\n\na\u00a0headache\nburning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area\na feeling of being generally unwell\na high temperature (fever)\n\nNot everyone will experience these prodromal symptoms. A high temperature is particularly uncommon.\nPain\nEventually, most people with shingles experience a localised \"band\" of pain in the affected area.\nThe pain can be a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe. You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender.\nPain is less common in young healthy people and is rare in children. It\u00a0usually starts a few days before the rash appears and can remain for a\u00a0few days or weeks after the rash has\u00a0healed.\nRash\nThe shingles rash usually appears on one side of your body and develops on the area of skin related to the affected nerve.\nInitially, the shingles rash appears as red blotches on your skin before developing into itchy\u00a0blisters\u00a0similar in appearance to chickenpox.\nNew blisters may appear for up to a week, but a few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out.\nScabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring. It usually takes two to four weeks for the rash to heal completely.\nWhen to seek\u00a0medical advice\nShingles is not usually serious, but you should see your GP as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms. Early treatment may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and the risk of developing complications.\nYou should also see your GP\u00a0if you\u00a0are pregnant or have a weakened immune system (the body's natural defence system) and you think you have been exposed to someone with chickenpox or shingles and haven't had chickenpox before.\n\n\nShingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which is the virus that causes chickenpox.\nAfter you have had\u00a0chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus lies dormant (inactive) inside your body. It can become reactivated at a later stage and cause shingles.\nIt is not known exactly\u00a0why the virus\u00a0is reactivated, but it is linked to having lowered immunity (protection against infection and diseases).\nYour immunity to illness and infection can become lowered if there is a problem with your immune system (the body's natural defence system). This can happen as a result of:\n\nold age \u2013 as you age, your immunity may decrease, and\u00a0shingles most commonly occurs in people over 70 years old\nphysical and emotional\u00a0stress \u2013 the chemicals released by your body when you are stressed can prevent your immune system working properly\nHIV and AIDS\u00a0\u2013 people with HIV are much more likely to get shingles than the rest of the population because their immune system is weak\nrecently having a bone marrow transplant\u00a0\u2013 the conditioning\u00a0you require before the transplant will weaken your immune system\nrecently having an organ transplant \u2013 you may need to take medication to suppress your immune system so\u00a0your body accepts the donated organ\nchemotherapy \u2013 chemotherapy medication, often used to treat cancer, can temporarily weaken your immune system\n\nHowever, young people who appear otherwise healthy can also sometimes develop shingles.\nIs shingles contagious?\nIt is not possible to catch shingles from someone else with the condition, or from someone with\u00a0chickenpox.\nHowever, it is possible for someone who has never had chickenpox to catch it from someone with shingles, as the shingles blisters contains the live virus.\nIn the UK, chickenpox is so common during childhood that 9 out of 10 adults have already had it and will not be at risk from someone with shingles.\nThe\u00a0blisters that develop as a result of shingles contain virus particles.\u00a0If you have not had chickenpox before, you can catch it from direct contact with the fluid from the blisters of someone who has shingles, or from\u00a0something that has the fluid on it, such as bed sheets or a towel.\nIf you have shingles, you are contagious until the last blister has scabbed over. This will usually occur after about 10 to 14 days.\nIf you have the shingles rash, do not share towels or flannels, go swimming, or play contact sports. This will help prevent the virus being passed on to someone who has not had chickenpox.\nYou should also avoid work or school if\u00a0your rash is weeping (oozing fluid) and cannot be covered.\nChickenpox can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people. If you have shingles, avoid:\n\nwomen who are pregnant and have not had chickenpox before as they could catch it from you, which may harm their unborn baby\npeople who have a weak immune system, such as someone with HIV or AIDS\nbabies less than one month old, unless it is your own baby, in which case your baby should have antibodies (proteins that fight infection) to protect them from the virus\n\nOnce your blisters have dried and scabbed over, you are no longer contagious and\u00a0will not need to avoid anyone.\n\n\nYour GP or pharmacist will normally be able to diagnose shingles from your symptoms and the appearance of your rash. Testing is not usually necessary.\nReferral\nIt is\u00a0uncommon for someone with shingles to be referred to a specialist for further assessment and treatment, but your GP may consider seeking specialist advice or referring you if:\n\nthey think you may have a\u00a0complication of shingles, such as\u00a0meningitis or\u00a0encephalitis\nshingles is affecting one of your eyes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0there is a risk\u00a0you could\u00a0develop permanent vision problems if the condition is not treated quickly\nyou have a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 particularly in severe cases or cases affecting children\nyou are pregnant\na diagnosis is not certain\n\nYou may also be referred to a specialist if you have an unusually persistent case of suspected shingles that is not responding to treatment, or if you have been diagnosed with the condition more than twice.\nWho might I see?\nWho you are referred to will depend on your circumstances. It could be:\n\na paediatrician (a specialist in the care of babies and children) if your child is affected\nan ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions) if shingles is affecting one of your eyes\nyour own consultant (a specialist in a particular area of medicine) if you have one for an existing medical condition such as HIV or AIDS\n\n\n\nThere is no cure for shingles, but treatment can help ease your symptoms until the condition improves. In many cases, shingles gets better within around two to four weeks.\nHowever, it's still important to see your GP or pharmacist as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms of shingles, as early treatment may help reduce the severity of the condition and the risk of\u00a0potential complications.\nSelf-care\nIf you develop the shingles rash, there are a number of things you can do to help relieve your symptoms, such as:\n\nkeeping the rash as clean and dry as possible\u00a0\u2013 this will reduce the risk of the rash becoming infected with bacteria\nwearing loose-fitting clothing\u00a0\u2013 this may help you feel more comfortable\nnot using topical (rub-on) antibiotics or adhesive dressings such as\u00a0plasters\u00a0\u2013 this can slow down the healing process\nusing a non-adherent dressing (a dressing that will not stick to the rash) if you need to cover the blisters\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0avoids passing the virus to anyone else\n\nCalamine lotion has a soothing, cooling effect on the skin and can be used to relieve the itching.\nIf you have any weeping blisters, you can use a cool compress (a cloth or a flannel cooled with tap water) several times a day to help soothe the skin and keep blisters clean.\nIt's important to only use the compress for around 20 minutes at a time and stop using them once the blisters stop oozing. Don't share any cloths, towels or flannels if you have the shingles rash.\u00a0\nAntiviral medication\nAs well as painkilling medication, some people with shingles may also be prescribed a course of antiviral tablets lasting 7 to 10 days. Commonly prescribed antiviral medicines include aciclovir, valaciclovir and famciclovir.\nThese medications cannot kill the shingles virus, but can help stop it multiplying. This may:\n\nreduce the severity of your shingles\nreduce how long your shingles lasts\nprevent complications of shingles, such as postherpetic neuralgia (although the evidence for this is uncertain)\n\nAntiviral medicines are most effective when taken within 72 hours of your rash appearing, although they may be started up to a week after your rash appears if you are at risk of severe shingles or developing complications.\nSide effects of antiviral medication are very uncommon, but can include:\n\nfeeling sick\nvomiting\ndiarrhoea\nabdominal (tummy) pain\nheadaches\ndizziness\n\nIf you are over 50 years of age and have symptoms of shingles, it is likely you will be prescribed an antiviral medication.\nYou may also be prescribed antiviral medication if you have:\n\nshingles that affects one of\u00a0your eyes\na weakened immune system\nmoderate to severe pain\na moderate to severe rash\n\nIf you are pregnant and have shingles, it is likely your GP will discuss your case with a specialist to decide whether the benefits of antiviral medication significantly outweigh any possible risks. Shingles will not harm your unborn baby.\nIf you are under 50 years of age, you are at less risk of developing complications from shingles anyway, so you may not need antiviral medication.\nAntiviral medication is not usually necessary for otherwise healthy children because they usually only experience mild symptoms of shingles and have a small risk of developing complications.\nHowever, if your child has a weakened immune system, they may need to be admitted to hospital to receive antiviral medication directly into a vein (intravenously).\nPainkilling medication\nTo ease the pain caused by shingles, your GP or pharmacist may recommend painkilling medication. Some of the main medications used to relieve pain associated with shingles are described below.\nThe most commonly used painkiller is\u00a0paracetamol, which is available without a prescription. Always read the manufacturer's instructions to make sure\u00a0the medicine is suitable and you are taking the correct dose.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are an alternative type of painkilling medicine also available without a prescription.\nHowever, NSAIDs may not be suitable if you:\n\nhave stomach, liver or kidney problems, such as a stomach\u00a0ulcer, or had them in the past\nhave asthma\nare pregnant or breastfeeding\n\nAsk your GP or pharmacist if you are unsure about whether you should take NSAIDs.\u00a0\nFor more severe pain, your GP may prescribe an opioid, such as codeine. This is a stronger type of painkiller sometimes prescribed alongside paracetamol.\nOccasionally, your GP may consider seeking specialist advice before prescribing an even\u00a0stronger opioid, such as morphine.\nIf you have severe pain as a result of shingles, you may be prescribed an antidepressant medicine. These medications\u00a0are commonly used to treat depression, but they have also proven to be useful in relieving nerve pain, such as the pain associated with shingles.\nThe antidepressants most often used to treat shingles pain are known as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Examples of TCAs most commonly prescribed for people with shingles are amitriptyline, imipramine\u00a0and nortriptyline.\nSide effects of TCAs can include:\n\nconstipation\ndifficulty urinating\nblurred vision\ndry mouth\nweight gain\ndrowsiness\n\nIf you have shingles, you will usually be prescribed a much lower dose of TCAs than if you were being treated for depression. This will usually be a tablet to take at night. Your dose may be increased until your pain settles down.\nIt may take several weeks before you start to feel the antidepressants working, although this is not always the case.\nAnticonvulsants are most commonly used to control\u00a0seizures (fits) caused by\u00a0epilepsy, but they are also useful in relieving nerve pain.\nGabapentin is the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants for shingles pain.\nSide effects of these medications can include:\n\ndizziness\ndrowsiness\nincreased appetite\nweight gain\nfeeling sick\nvomiting\n\nAs with antidepressants, you may need to take anticonvulsants for several weeks before you notice it working.\nIf your pain does not improve, your dose may be gradually increased until your symptoms are effectively managed.\n\n\nComplications can sometimes occur as a result of shingles. They are more likely if you have a weakened immune system (the body's natural defence system) or are elderly.\nSome of the main complications associated with shingles are described below.\nPostherpetic neuralgia\nPostherpetic neuralgia\u00a0is the most common complication of shingles. It's not clear exactly how many people are affected, but some estimates suggest that as many as one in five people over 50 could develop\u00a0postherpetic neuralgia as\u00a0the result of shingles.\nPostherpetic neuralgia can cause severe nerve pain (neuralgia) and intense itching\u00a0that persists after the rash and any other symptoms of shingles have gone.\nTypes of pain experienced by people with postherpetic neuralgia include:\n\nconstant or intermittent\u00a0burning, aching, throbbing, stabbing, or shooting pain\nallodynia\u00a0\u2013 where you feel pain from something that should not be painful, such as changes in temperature or the wind\nhyperalgesia\u00a0\u2013 where you are very sensitive to pain\n\nPostherpetic neuralgia sometimes resolves after around three to six months, although it can last for years and some cases can be permanent. It can be treated with a number of different painkilling medicines.\nEye problems\nIf one of your eyes is affected by shingles (ophthalmic shingles), there is a risk you could develop further problems in the affected eye, such as:\n\nulceration (sores) and permanent scarring of the surface of your eye (cornea)\ninflammation\u00a0of the eye and optic nerve (the nerve that transmits signals from the eye to the brain)\nglaucoma\u00a0\u2013 where pressure builds up inside the eye\n\nIf not treated promptly, there is a risk that ophthalmic shingles could cause a degree of permanent vision loss.\nRamsay Hunt syndrome\nRamsay Hunt syndrome is a complication that can occur if shingles affects certain nerves in your head.\nIn\u00a0the US,\u00a0Ramsay Hunt syndrome is estimated to affect\u00a05\u00a0in 100,000 people every year and it may affect a similar number of people in the UK.\nRamsay Hunt syndrome can cause:\n\nearache\u00a0\nhearing loss\u00a0\ndizziness\nvertigo\u00a0(the sensation that you or the environment around you is moving or spinning)\ntinnitus\u00a0(hearing sounds coming from inside your body, rather than an outside source)\u00a0\na rash around the ear\nloss of taste\nparalysis (weakness) of your face\n\nRamsay Hunt syndrome is usually treated\u00a0with antiviral medication, corticosteroids and painkilling medication.\nThe earlier treatment is started, the better the outcome. Around three-quarters of people given antiviral medication within 72 hours\u00a0of the start of their symptoms usually make a complete recovery.\nIf treatment is delayed, only about half of those treated will recover completely.\nThose\u00a0who don't make a full recovery may be left with permanent problems, such as a degree of permanent facial paralysis or hearing loss.\nOther complications\nA number of other possible problems can also sometimes develop as a result of shingles, including:\n\nthe rash becoming infected with bacteria\u00a0\u2013 see your GP if you develop a high temperature, as this could be a sign of a bacterial infection\nwhite patches (a loss of pigment) or\u00a0scarring in the area of the rash\ninflammation of the lungs (pneumonia), liver\u00a0(hepatitis), brain (encephalitis), spinal cord (transverse myelitis), or\u00a0protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) \u2013 these complications are rare, however\u00a0\n\nShingles is rarely life threatening, but complications such as those mentioned above\u00a0mean that around\u00a01 in every 1,000 cases in adults over the age of 70 is fatal.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Sickle cell disease is the name for a group of blood disorders. The most severe is sickle cell anaemia. These disorders are inherited, meaning they are passed on through your genes.\nYou can have a blood test at any time to find out if you carry the gene for sickle cell disease, or if you have sickle cell disease.\nSickle cell disease affects how your body produces red blood cells. Normal red blood cells are round \u2013 red blood cells affected by sickle cell disease harden and become sickle-shaped, like a crescent moon. This causes them to die too quickly and block blood vessels, leading to symptoms that are often painful.\nPeople from particular ethnic backgrounds are more likely to have sickle cell disease or carry the gene. You are more likely to have sickle cell disease if you are from one of these ethnic backgrounds:\n\nAfrican\nAsian\nCaribbean\nEastern Mediterranean\nMiddle Eastern\n\nThere are treatments to manage sickle cell disease, but no cure yet \u2013 it's a lifelong condition.\nFind out about symptoms and diagnosis\nFind out about treating sickle cell disease\nFind out about living with sickle cell disease\nFind out about screening to see if you're a sickle cell carrier\n\n\nThe main symptoms of sickle cell disease are sickle cell crises (very painful episodes affecting different parts of the body), infections, and anaemia.\nThere are a number of serious problems that can appear suddenly as a result of sickle cell disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should get medical advice immediately:\n\nhigh temperature (a fever) going to 38C (100.4F) or higher\ndifficulty breathing\ndrowsiness, confusion, or slurred speech\na severe headache, stiff neck, or dizziness\nskin or lips that are very pale\nfits (seizures)\nserious pain that isn't responding to treatments at home\nsudden swelling in the tummy\npriapism \u2013 a painful erection lasting two hours or more\nweakness on one or both sides of your body\nsudden vision loss, or changes in your vision\n\nIf you develop any of the symptoms listed above, phone your GP or care team immediately. If you can't contact your GP or care team, go to your closest Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you aren't able to travel yourself.\nIt's important to make sure that the medical team looking after you know that you have sickle cell disease.\nEpisodes of pain known as sickle cell crises happen when the blood vessels that go to one part of your body become blocked. The pain can be severe.\nSickle cell crises are one of the most common symptoms of sickle cell disease and, on average, occur once a year and last up to seven days. Some people have sickle cell crises every few weeks \u2013 others experience them less than once a year.\nA sickle cell crisis typically affects one part of the body at a time. The most common parts affected are:\n\nhands or feet (this is especially common in young children)\nribs and breastbone\nspine\npelvis\ntummy\nlegs and arms\n\nSickle cell crises have different causes. They can be triggered by cold, rainy or windy weather, stress, dehydration, or exercise that leaves you severely out of breath.\nSickle cell disease leaves people \u2013 especially children \u2013 extra vulnerable to infection because their bodies aren't as effective at dealing with bacteria and viruses. This leaves them more vulnerable to viruses like the common cold, as well as severe and potentially life-threatening conditions like meningitis.\nAs well as keeping up to date with their vaccinations, many people with sickle cell disease take daily doses of antibiotics in order to prevent infections.\nAlmost everyone with sickle cell disease has anaemia. Haemoglobin is found in red blood cells \u2013 it's the substance that transports oxygen around the body. People with anaemia have low levels of haemoglobin in their blood.\nMost of the time anaemia doesn't cause symptoms, but if you're infected with parvovirus, the virus that causes slapped cheek syndrome, the anaemia can get worse. When that happens, it causes:\n\nheadaches\na fast heartbeat\nfainting\ndizziness\n\nIf these symptoms occur, the anaemia is usually treated with a blood transfusion.\nSudden anaemia can happen in young children if they experience swelling of the spleen. This is also treated with a blood transfusion.\nThere's a wide range of other issues that can be caused by sickle cell disease. These include:\n\na serious lung condition called acute chest syndrome that can cause chest pain, a cough, breathing difficulties and fever\npain in bones and joints\ndelayed puberty\ndelayed growth in childhood\nkidney or urinary problems, including bedwetting and blood in the urine\ngallstones \u2013 these are stones in the gallbladder that can cause jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) and abdominal (tummy) pain\nulcers on the lower legs (open sores that can be very painful)\npriapism \u2013 a painful, persistent erection that can last for several hours\nhigh blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension)\ntransient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes \u2013 these happen when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or blocked\nenlarged spleen \u2013 this can cause a fast heartbeat, worsening of anaemia, a swollen tummy, shortness of breath and abdominal pain\nvision problems like floaters, worsened night vision, blurred vision, patchy vision and, occasionally, sudden vision loss\n\nThese symptoms can be treated \u2013 see Treating sickle cell disease for more information.\nYou can have a blood test any time to find out if you have sickle cell disease, or find out if you're a carrier who could have a child with the condition.\nSickle cell disease is usually diagnosed during pregnancy \u2013 free screening to find out if a baby is at risk of having the condition is offered to every pregnant woman in Scotland.\nEven if your family background doesn't make it likely your child will have sickle cell disease, you can still request a test.\nIf possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there's time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.\nNewborn babies are screened for sickle cell disease as part of the newborn blood spot test \u2013 the heel prick test. There are a few reasons for this:\n\nif a baby's parents weren't screened during pregnancy, this test identifies if the child has sickle cell disease\nif screening during pregnancy showed that the baby had a high risk of having sickle cell disease, but no more testing was done, the heel prick test will determine if the child has the condition or not\nthis test shows if the baby is a carrier of sickle cell, and could one day have children of their own who have the condition (find out more about sickle cell carriers here)\nthe heel prick test identifies other inherited conditions, like cystic fibrosis\n\nAnother blood test will be used to confirm the diagnosis if the heel prick test suggests that the baby could have sickle cell disease.\nLearn about being tested to see if you carry the sickle cell gene\n\n\nPeople of all ages with sickle cell disease are supported by a team of medical professionals in a specialist sickle cell centre. A specialised care plan will be developed with you that helps you to fully understand the condition and find the best way of managing it.\nSickle cell crises can usually be managed at home. The following steps are recommended for adults or children experiencing a sickle cell crisis:\n\nover the counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen can help \u2013 although aspirin should not be given to anyone under 16 \u2013 and if needed, your GP may prescribe stronger painkillers\nheating pads or warm towels can be placed on the area and massaged to ease the pain \u2013 pharmacies usually sell heating pads you can use for this\ndrink plenty \u2013 staying hydrated will help\nrelaxing distractions like reading, videos, and computer games are a good way to distract your mind, or your child's mind, from the pain\n\nIf none of the above measures help, or the pain is very severe, phone your GP. You or your child should go to the local accident and emergency (A&E) if it's not possible to contact your GP. It may be necessary for you or your child to spend a few days in hospital being treated with stronger pain relief.\nThe best way to prevent a sickle cell crisis is by being aware of potential triggers and avoiding them.\n\nPrevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids \u2013especially water.\nAvoid alcohol \u2013 alcohol causes dehydration.\nStay warm with enough layers of clothing to avoid getting cold, and avoid extreme temperatures.\nDon't expose yourself to sudden changes in temperature \u2013 for example, avoid swimming in cold water.\nThe lack of oxygen at high altitudes can trigger a sickle cell crisis, so be careful if you're at high altitude for any reason. However, plane travel shouldn't be an issue because planes maintain a consistent oxygen level due to being pressurised.\nMake sure to stay active, but avoid activities that leave you severely out of breath.\nDon't smoke \u2013 smoking can trigger acute chest syndrome.\nStay relaxed as much as you can \u2013 sickle cell crises can be triggered by stress, so consider learning relaxation techniques like breathing exercises.\n\nYour care team may recommend a medication called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) if you keep experiencing sickle cell crises. This is a capsule that is taken once a day. It works by reducing how many other types of blood cell, like white blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) there are in the body.\nThis means that you'll need regular blood tests to make sure you're healthy.\nChildren who have sickle cell disease should be kept up to date on all of their routine vaccinations, and may also need additional vaccinations like the hepatitis B vaccine and the annual flu vaccine.\nIf you have sickle cell disease, you'll most likely need to take a dose of antibiotics every day, usually penicillin. This will not pose serious health risks.\nReduce risk in day-to-day life by being careful about activities that can make you vulnerable to infection. Always follow good food hygiene measures, for example.\nIf you're planning to go abroad, talk to your GP as far in advance as you can. You might need extra vaccinations or medication, such as anti-malarials if you're going to a place where malaria is a risk. It may also be a good idea to take extra precautions when it comes to food and water.\nMost of the time, anaemia doesn't have any symptoms and you won't require any treatment for it. However, children with sickle cell anaemia who are also on a restricted diet (such as a vegan or vegetarian diet) may need folic acid supplements. Folic acid helps your body to create more red blood cells, so it can help to improve anaemia.\nIt's important to be aware that this type of anaemia isn't the same as the anaemia caused by iron deficiency, so don't take iron supplements without talking to your care team first. Taking iron supplements with the anaemia caused by sickle cell disease can be dangerous.\nBlood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide may be necessary for serious or persistent anaemia.\nThere are a range of treatments for other problems that can be caused by sickle cell disease, depending on the type of symptom and how severe it is:\n\npeople with acute chest syndrome need emergency treatment \u2013 this involves oxygen, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and fluids given through a vein, as well as possibly hydroxycarbamide to prevent it happening again\npainkillers can treat joint and bone pain\na short course of hormones can be given to children in order to trigger delayed puberty\ngallbladder removal surgery is used to treat gallstones\nfor persistent priapism, medication can stimulate blood flow, or a needle can be used to drain blood from the penis\nregular blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide are given to people who have had a stroke or who are at greater risk of having one\n\nIn addition to the treatments above, chelation therapy involves taking medication to make the level of iron in your blood lower, bringing it to safe levels. This treatment is given to people who need a lot of blood transfusions.\nLearn more about living with sickle cell disease here\n\n\nSickle cell disease is a lifelong illness, which can be managed well with treatment and self-help. In addition to preventing symptoms and crises as much as possible, there are a few things you can do that will make it easier to live with the condition and stay in the best possible health.\nIf you're due to have surgery, or you're brought in for surgery in an emergency, it's very important you take some precautions.\nYou should tell your care team about any surgeries you have planned that involve a general anaesthetic.\nTell your surgeon on the day that you have sickle cell disease.\nGeneral anaesthetic can cause a number of problems, including increasing the risk of a sickle cell crisis. It's important that you're monitored closely during the surgery, and are given plenty of fluids as well as being kept warm.\nIt might be necessary to have a blood transfusion before the surgery to reduce the chances of complications.\nYou can have a healthy pregnancy if you have sickle cell disease, but it's a good idea to talk to your care team before planning a pregnancy, for a number of reasons:\n\nthere's a bigger chance of complications such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, anaemia and sickle cell pain while you're pregnant\nyou may have to stop taking some of the medications for sickle cell disease, like hydroxycarbamide, before getting pregnant, as these can harm a foetus\nit may be a good idea to find out if your partner is a sickle cell carrier and talk with a counsellor about what this could mean\nextra monitoring during pregnancy, as well as extra treatment, might be necessary\n\nIt's important to use a reliable form of contraception if you aren't planning a pregnancy.\nLearn about pregnancy and newborn screening for sickle cell disease\nMost children with sickle cell disease lead normal, happy lives. However, sickle cell disease can be very different from person to person, and it's still a serious condition.\nSickle cell disease can have a big impact on someone's life. It can lead to serious infections, strokes and transcient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), and lung problems, which can be fatal.\nThe overall live expectancy for people with sickle cell disease is shorter than normal, but this changes depending on the type of sickle cell disease, what problems they experience, and how the condition is treated.\nMilder types of sickle cell disease may not impact life expectancy. People with sickle cell anaemia have a typical life expectancy of between 40 and 60 years of age. As newer treatments are developed, it's hoped that the outlook will get better.\n\n\nSickle cell disease is caused by a gene problem that is inherited from your parents. It isn't something you can catch, and it's not caused by anything the parents did during or before pregnancy.\nYou inherit one set of genes from your mother, and one from your father. Genes always come in pairs. Children born with sickle cell disease inherit a copy of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, so each one of the pair of genes is faulty.\nThis happens when both parents are \"carriers\" \u2013 they carry the faulty gene for sickle cell. This is also known as having the sickle cell trait.\nCarriers don't have sickle cell disease, but if their partner is a carrier too they may have a child with the condition.\nWhen both of a child's parents are sickle cell carriers:\n\nthere's a 25% (one in four) chance that each of their children won't inherit any faulty genes \u2013 they won't have sickle cell disease, and they won't be able to pass it on to their children\nthere's a 50% (one in two) chance that each child will inherit a copy of the faulty gene from just one parent, and be a sickle cell carrier\nthere's a 25% (one in four) chance that each child will inherit copies of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, and have sickle cell disease when they're born\n\nYou can find more information about how sickle cell disease is inherited from the Sickle Cell Society.\nLearn more about sickle cell carriers and screening\n\n\nSickle cell disease carriers are people who carry the faulty gene that causes sickle cell disease, but do not have the disease. This is also called having the sickle cell trait.\nIf you have the sickle cell trait, you won't develop sickle cell disease. However, there's a risk that you'll have a child with the condition, or who is also a sickle cell disease carrier.\nThe sickle cell gene can be carried by anyone, but people from certain ethnic backgrounds are much more likely to be carriers.\nYou are more likely to be a carrier if you have family from one of these areas :\n\nAfrica\nAsia\nThe Caribbean\nThe Eastern Mediterranean\nThe Middle East\n\nMost sickle cell carriers in the UK have an African or Caribbean family background \u2013 it's estimated around one in ten people with this background may be a sickle cell carrier.\nYou can request a blood test from your GP at any time to find out if you're a sickle cell carrier. This is a particularly good idea if your family background makes it more likely that you have the gene.\nBoth men and women are able to get the test.\nEvery pregnant woman in Scotland is offered screening to check if their baby is at risk of being born with sickle cell disease. You can ask for a test even if your family background doesn't suggest your child will have sickle cell disease. It's a good idea to have your partner screened for the gene too.\nIf possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there's time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.\nRead more about diagnosis and screening for the sickle cell disease gene here\nOther health risks for sickle cell carriers\nYou're not at risk of developing sickle cell disease if you carry sickle cell.\nThe only time you may be at risk of health problems is in rare cases where you might not get enough oxygen, such as:\n\nhaving surgery under\u00a0general anaesthetic\u00a0\u2013 make sure your medical team know\u00a0you carry sickle cell before your operation so they can ensure you get enough oxygen\nduring extreme sports such as deep sea diving and climbing at high altitudes \u2013 if you do sports like these, ensure you're never short of oxygen\nduring regular, intensive physical activity \u2013 make sure you drink plenty of fluids during training and avoid extreme exhaustion\n\nThere's also a very small risk of developing kidney problems associated with carrying sickle cell.\nApart from these uncommon situations, you can lead a completely normal and healthy life if you're a sickle cell carrier.\nOther blood disorders\nSickle cell carriers are also at risk of having a child with a blood disorder if their partner is a carrier of a different type of blood disorder.\nYou can find more detailed information about some of the other types of carrier in the following pages:\u00a0\n\nYour baby carries a gene for Sickle Cell\nYour baby carries a gene for unusual haemoglobin\u00a0\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Sinusitis is a common condition in which the lining of the sinuses becomes inflamed. It's usually caused by a viral infection and often improves within two or three weeks.\nThe\u00a0sinuses are small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead.\nThe mucus produced by your sinuses usually drains into your nose through small channels. In sinusitis, these channels become blocked because the sinus linings are inflamed (swollen).\nSigns and symptoms\nSinusitis usually occurs after an upper respiratory tract\u00a0infection, such as a\u00a0cold. If you have a\u00a0persistent cold and develop the symptoms below, you may have sinusitis.\nSymptoms of sinusitis\u00a0include:\n\na green or yellow\u00a0discharge from your nose\na blocked nose\npain and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead\na\u00a0sinus headache\na high temperature (fever) of\u00a038C (100.4F) or more\ntoothache\na reduced sense of smell\nbad breath (halitosis)\n\nChildren with sinusitis may be irritable, breathe through their mouth, and have difficulty feeding.

Only a few cases are caused by bacteria infecting the sinuses.\nAn infected tooth or fungal infection can also occasionally cause the sinuses to become inflamed.\nIt's not clear exactly what causes sinusitis to become chronic (long-lasting), but it has been associated with:\n\nallergies\u00a0and related conditions,\u00a0including allergic rhinitis, asthma and hay fever\nnasal polyps (growths inside the nose)\nsmoking\na weakened immune system\n\nMaking sure underlying conditions such as allergies and asthma are well controlled may improve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis.\n\n\nMost people with sinusitis don't need to see their GP. The condition is normally caused by a viral infection that clears up on its own.\nYour symptoms will usually pass within two or three weeks (acute sinusitis) and you can look after yourself at home.\nIf the condition is severe, gets worse, or doesn't improve (chronic sinusitis), you may need additional treatment from your GP or a hospital specialist.\u00a0This can be difficult to treat and it may be\u00a0several months before you're feeling better.\nLooking after yourself at home\nIf your symptoms are mild and have\u00a0lasted less than a week or so, you can usually take care of yourself without seeing your GP.\nThe following tips may help you feel better until you recover:\n\nTake over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen\u00a0to relieve a high temperature and pain\u00a0\u2013 check the leaflet that comes with your medication first to check it's suitable, and never give aspirin to\u00a0children under 16 years of age.\nUse\u00a0over-the-counter decongestant nasal sprays\u00a0or drops to help unblock your\u00a0nose and\u00a0allow you to breathe more easily\u00a0\u2013 these shouldn't be used for more than a week at a time.\nApply warm packs to your face to soothe your pain and help mucus drain from your sinuses.\nRegularly clean the inside of your nose with a salt water solution to help\u00a0unblock your nose and reduce nasal discharge.\n\nYou can clean the inside of your nose using either a home-made salt water solution or a solution made with sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy.\nTo make the solution at home, mix a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into a pint of boiled water that has been left to cool. To rinse your nose:\n\nwash and dry your hands\nstand over a sink, cup the palm of one hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it\nsniff the water into one nostril at a time\n\nRepeat these steps until your nose feels more comfortable (you may not need to use all of the solution). You should make a fresh solution each day. Don't re-use a solution made the day before.\nSpecial devices you can use instead of your hand are also available from pharmacies. If you choose to use one of these, make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions about using and cleaning it.\nTreatments from your\u00a0GP\nSee your GP if your symptoms are severe, don't start to improve\u00a0within 7 to 10 days, or are getting worse. They may recommend\u00a0additional treatment with\u00a0corticosteroid\u00a0drops or sprays, or antibiotics.\nIf these treatments don't help, you GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for an assessment and to discuss whether surgery is a suitable option.\nCorticosteroids,\u00a0also known as\u00a0steroids, are a group of medications that can help to reduce inflammation.\nIf you have persistent symptoms of sinusitis, your GP may prescribe steroid nasal drops or sprays\u00a0to help reduce the swelling in your sinuses. These may need to be used for several months.\nPossible side effects include nasal irritation, a\u00a0sore throat and nosebleeds.\nIf your GP thinks your sinuses may be infected with bacteria, they will prescribe a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules to treat the infection.\nYou'll usually need to take these for\u00a0a week, although sometimes a longer course may be prescribed.\nPossible side effects of antibiotics include feeling and being sick, diarrhoea and abdominal (tummy) pain.\nSurgery\nIf your symptoms don't improve despite trying the treatments mentioned above, a type of surgery called functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) may be recommended. This is a procedure to improve the drainage of mucus from your sinuses.\nFESS\u00a0is usually carried out under general anaesthetic. During the procedure, the surgeon will insert an endoscope into your nose. This is a thin tube with a lens at one end that magnifies the inside of your nose. It will allow the surgeon to see the opening of your sinuses and insert small surgical instruments.\nThe surgeon will then either:\n\nremove any tissues, such as\u00a0nasal polyps (growths), that are blocking the affected sinus\ninflate a tiny balloon in the drainage passages from your sinuses to widen them, before the balloon\u00a0is deflated and removed (this is known as a balloon catheter dilation)\n\nPotential side effects and risks of these procedures include temporary discomfort and crusting inside the nose, bleeding from the nose and infection. Make sure you discuss the risks with your surgeon beforehand.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also provides information about balloon catheter dilation for chronic sinusitis.\n\n\nComplications in children\nComplications of sinusitis are more common in children than in adults. If your child has had sinusitis and has swelling around the cheekbone or eyelid, it may be a bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissue or an infection of the\u00a0tissue surrounding the eye. Read about\u00a0cellulitis for more information.\nIf you notice these symptoms, take your child to see your GP, who may refer them to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist. Alternatively, you can call NHS 24's 111 service.\nInfection of the bone\nWhen the condition is severe, antibiotics are often able to control the spread of infection to the nearby bone. However, in very rare cases (about\u00a0one in 10,000), infection can spread to the area surrounding\u00a0the eye, the bones, the blood or the brain.\n\n\nYour GP can usually diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms.\nSinusitis is nearly always caused by a viral infection, such as the\u00a0common cold or flu, and is diagnosed based on the presence of:\n\nnasal blockage or runny nose with facial pain, and/or\na reduction or loss of sense of smell\n\nLoss of smell is more common and facial pain less common\u00a0in chronic (persistent) sinusitis.\nReferral to a specialist\nIf your sinusitis is severe or keeps coming back,\u00a0your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist who will carry out tests to determine the underlying cause.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Sj\u00f6gren's (pronounced Show-grin's) syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. The body\u2019s immune system attacks glands that secrete fluid, such as the tear and saliva glands.\nThe effects of\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can be widespread. Certain glands become inflamed, which reduces the production of tears and saliva, causing the main symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, which are\u00a0dry eyes and dry mouth.\nIn women (who are most commonly affected), the glands that keep the vagina moist can also be affected, leading to vaginal dryness.\nRead\u00a0more about the\u00a0symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome\nWhat causes Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome?\nSj\u00f6gren's syndrome is an autoimmune condition, which means that instead of protecting the body from infection or illness, the immune system reacts abnormally and starts attacking healthy cells and tissue.\nIn Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the immune system attacks the tear and saliva glands,\u00a0and other secretory glands throughout the body.\nThe reasons for this remains unknown, but research suggests that it's triggered by a combination of genetic, environmental and, possibly, hormonal factors.\nSome people are thought to be more vulnerable to the syndrome when they're born and that certain events, such an infection, can trigger the problems with the immune system.\nRead more about the causes of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome\nHealthcare professionals classify Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome as being either:\n\nprimary \u2013 when the syndrome develops by itself and not as the result of another condition\nsecondary \u2013 when the syndrome develops in combination with another autoimmune disorder, such as\u00a0lupus or rheumatoid arthritis\n\nDiagnosing\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nSj\u00f6gren's syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, because\u00a0it has similar symptoms to other conditions and there is no single test for it.\nYour doctor will ask about your symptoms and carry out a test to see how dry your mouth and eyes are.\nRead more about diagnosing Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nTreating Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nThere is no cure for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but treatments can help control symptoms.\nDry eyes and mouth can usually be\u00a0helped with artificial tears and saliva.\nIt's important to maintain good eye and mouth hygiene, because your risk of developing an infection is greater. Taking care of your eyes and mouth can help prevent problems such as\u00a0corneal ulcers and tooth decay.\nIn severe cases, medication or surgery may be recommended.\nRead more about treating Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nComplications of\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nSj\u00f6gren's syndrome can sometimes lead to complications.

Antibodies attack bacteria and viruses, which help stop you from becoming ill.\nAn autoimmune condition causes your immune system to react abnormally. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as bacteria, the antibodies start attacking your body's healthy cells and tissue.\nIn Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the parts of the body usually affected are the tear, saliva and vaginal glands, which are collectively known as the exocrine glands.\nThe antibodies damage the exocrine glands so they can no longer function normally. There's some evidence that the immune system also damages the nerves that control these glands, which further reduces their effectiveness.\nThe immune system can go on to damage other parts of the body, such as muscles, joints, blood vessels, nerves and, less commonly, organs.\nPossible triggers for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nMost researchers believe that primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\nCertain people are born with specific genes that make them more vulnerable to a faulty immune system. Then, many years later, an environmental factor, possibly a common virus, triggers the immune system to stop working properly.\nThe female hormone oestrogen also seems to play\u00a0a role. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome mostly occurs in women, and symptoms usually start around the time of the menopause, when oestrogen levels begin to fall. Falling oestrogen levels can contribute to dryness, and this dryness\u00a0could make the\u00a0condition more noticeable.\nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome can be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. This is known as secondary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.\nThe exocrine glands\nYour saliva and tear glands play a vital role in protecting your mouth and eyes, which is why the symptoms of\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can be widespread and troublesome.\nWe usually only notice our tears when we cry, but our eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, known as a tear film.\nTears are made up of a mix of water, proteins, fats, mucus and infection-fighting cells. Tears serve several important functions. They:\n\nlubricate the eye\nkeep the eye clean and free of dust\nprotect the eye against infection\nhelp stabilise your vision\n\nSaliva also serves several important functions, including:\n\nkeeping the mouth and throat naturally lubricated\naiding digestion by moistening food and containing enzymes that can break down certain starches\nacting as a natural disinfectant (saliva contains antibodies, enzymes and proteins that protect against some common bacterial and fungal infections)\n\n\n\nSj\u00f6gren's syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other health conditions.\nYou may see different health professionals\u00a0for your\u00a0different symptoms, such as a dentist for a\u00a0dry mouth, an optician for\u00a0dry eyes and a gynaecologist for\u00a0a\u00a0dry vagina, which can sometimes make it difficult to reach a firm diagnosis.\nSee\u00a0your GP if you experience any symptoms of dryness, particularly of your eyes and mouth.\nScreening questions\nExperts in the field have come up with a series of screening questions, which may be useful if you're worried you may have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.\nIf you answer \"yes\" to most of the questions below, you may have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and will probably be advised to have further tests.\n\nHave you had daily, persistent, troublesome dry eyes for more than three months?\nDo you keep having a sensation of grit in your eye?\nDo you need to use eye drops containing tear substitutes more than three times a day?\nHave you had a daily feeling of dry mouth for more than three months?\nDo you keep getting swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and your ears)?\nDo you frequently drink liquids to help you swallow food?\n\nFurther testing\nTests used to diagnose\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome include:\n\ntear break-up time and Schirmer tests\na lip biopsy\nblood tests\nsalivary flow rate\n\nThese are explained below.\nTear break-up time and Schirmer tests are usually carried out by an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions).\nThe tear break-up time test measures how effective your tear glands are.\u00a0A non-toxic dye is dropped onto the surface of your eye and the\u00a0colour of the dye allows the ophthalmologist to see how well your tear film is functioning and how long it takes for your tears to evaporate.\nThis test is also carried out\u00a0using a slit lamp. A slit lamp is a low-power microscope with a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine in a\u00a0narrow beam. The specialist will use the slit lamp to examine your tear glands more closely.\nIn the Schirmer test, small strips of blotting paper are placed into your lower eyelid. After five minutes, the strips are removed to see how much of the paper is soaked with tears.\nDuring a lip biopsy, a small tissue\u00a0sample\u00a0is removed from your inner lip and examined under a microscope. A local anaesthetic\u00a0is\u00a0injected into\u00a0the inner surface of your lower lip to numb the area, before a small cut is made to remove a few of your minor salivary glands.\nClusters of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the tissue can indicate Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.\nBlood tests\u00a0are carried out to look for antibodies known as anti-Ro and anti-La (or SS-A and SS-B), which are produced when the immune system has been affected by Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.\nThese antibodies are only present in about 60% of people with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, so it's possible to have a negative blood test result and still have the condition.\nA salivary flow rate test measures how much saliva your glands produce.\nYou'll usually be asked to spit as much saliva as you can into a cup\u00a0over a five-minute period. The amount of saliva is then weighed or measured. An unusually low flow rate can indicate Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.\n\n\nThere's no cure for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but treatments help relieve symptoms such as eye and mouth dryness.\nSj\u00f6gren's syndrome affects everyone in different ways, so your treatment plan will be\u00a0tailored to suit you.\nEye care\nMild to moderate cases of dry eye can usually be successfully treated with eye drops containing \"artificial tears\" \u2013 a liquid that mimics tears. These eye drops are available from a pharmacist, without a prescription.\nThere are many different types of eye drops, so you can try different brands to find the one that works best for you. If you're using eye drops regularly (more than three times a day), you should use one that doesn't contain\u00a0preservatives. This is because there's evidence that over-exposure to preservatives can damage the surface of the eye.\nA short-term dose of eye drops containing corticosteroids may be recommended if your eyes become irritated. However,\u00a0long-term corticosteroid use isn't recommended because they can cause serious side effects.\nTo minimise the chance of experiencing side effects from corticosteroids, you'll be prescribed the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.\nWearing glasses reduces tear evaporation by up to 30%, and this effect can be maximised by wearing specially-made glasses called moisture chamber spectacles. These wrap around your eyes like goggles and help retain moisture and protect the eyes from irritants.\nSome people used to be embarrassed to\u00a0wear them, but modern designs look like sports glasses.\nPunctual occlusion is a widely-used technique that seals the tear ducts (into which the tears drain) with small plugs. This should help keep\u00a0the eye better protected by tears.\nTemporary plugs made of silicone are usually used first to see if they help. If it does, more permanent plugs can be used.\nMouth care\nA\u00a0number of techniques can be used to keep your mouth lubricated, including:\n\nmaintaining good oral hygiene to\u00a0prevent tooth decay and\u00a0gum disease\nincreasing your fluid intake\nusing sugar-free chewing gum to stimulate saliva production\nsucking ice cubes to help lubricate your mouth and reduce dryness\nregularly using mouth rinses to soothe\u00a0your mouth and protect it against infection\n\nIf you smoke, you should try to quit. Smoking irritates the mouth and increases the rate at which saliva evaporates.\nRead more about\u00a0how to stop smoking\nThere are a number of saliva substitute products that can help lubricate your mouth. However, they don't replicate the role of\u00a0saliva in preventing infection, so you'll still need to maintain excellent oral hygiene.\nSaliva substitutes are available as a spray, lozenge (medicated sweet), gel, or gum. Your GP or pharmacist can tell you which product is most suitable for you.\nMedication for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nThe medicine pilocarpine is often used to treat the symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth. Pilocarpine stimulates the glands to produce more saliva and tears.\nSide effects of pilocarpine include:\n\nhyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nheartburn\nabdominal (stomach) pain\nan increased need to go to the toilet\n\nFor some people, the side effects of pilocarpine are mild. Others find that the side effects outweigh the benefits.\nDon't take pilocarpine if you have\u00a0asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.\nHydroxychloroquine has been shown to slow down the immune system's attack on the tear and saliva glands. It can also help reduce any associated symptoms of muscle pain, joint pain and stiffness.\nYou'll need to take hydroxychloroquine for several weeks before you notice any improvements, and it could be six months before you experience the full benefit of the treatment.\nSide effects are uncommon and usually mild. They include:\n\nnausea\nskin rash\nloss of appetite\nstomach cramps\nvomiting\n\nIn very rare cases, hydroxychloroquine can damage the retina, affecting vision. You'll probably be asked to attend an eye examination so that your retina can be checked before you start treatment. Regular eye examinations (usually at least once a year) are also recommended after you begin treatment.\nHydroxychloroquine shouldn't be used by breastfeeding women.\nTreating other symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome\nSeveral soaps and creams are specifically designed for people with dry skin. Your pharmacist or GP can advise you.\nVaginal dryness can be treated using a lubricant. Some women also use oestrogen creams or hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\nMuscle and joint pains can be treated with an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen. If this doesn't work, see your GP, as stronger NSAIDs are available on prescription.\nNSAIDs can increase your risk of developing stomach ulcers and internal bleeding, particularly if they're taken on a long-term basis.\nIf you find swallowing NSAIDs difficult because of your dry mouth, you can try an NSAID cream that's rubbed into affected joints.\nNSAIDs aren't recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for people with pre-existing risk factors for cardiovascular or kidney conditions.\nGeneral advice\nThese\u00a0simple tips can help prevent many of the problems associated with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome:\n\nhave a dental check-up every six months\npractise good dental hygiene \u2013 brushing, flossing and using mouthwash regularly\navoid eating too many sweet foods\navoid strong and perfumed soaps \u2013 use special creams and soaps from your pharmacist\navoid dry environments, such as air-conditioned offices, whenever possible\navoid drinking too much\u00a0alcohol\n\n\n\nSj\u00f6gren's syndrome isn't usually life-threatening, but it is linked to more seriousproblems.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nIt's estimated that people with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome are 44 times more likely to develop\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma than people without the condition.\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is a\u00a0cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) that are spread throughout your body, much like your blood vessels.\nWhile this increased risk may sound alarming, the chance of a person with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma is still small, as it only affects around 5% of people with the syndrome.\nHowever, if you have Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, you should be aware of the main early symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a painless swelling in a lymph node (gland) \u2013 usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Report any swollen lymph nodes to your GP.\nEye damage\nIf dry eyes aren't treated, they can\u00a0become inflamed and you can develop ulcers on the surface of your\u00a0eyes (corneal ulcers).\nIf left untreated, corneal ulcers can lead to loss of vision and permanent sight damage.\nPregnancy\nIf you're planning to become pregnant and have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, ask your GP to test for certain antibodies that may be present in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and are known to cause a temporary\u00a0lupus rash in newborn babies. In very rare cases, the antibodies can also cause heart defects in babies.\nIf these antibodies are found, there should be no reason why you can't continue with the pregnancy, but your child may need additional specialist care during pregnancy and after the birth.\nRead more about\u00a0antenatal appointments\nOther conditions\nA number of other conditions have been linked to Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, including:\u00a0\n\nperipheral neuropathy \u2013 a condition that often involves loss of sensation in the hands and feet\nRaynaud's phenomenon\u00a0\u2013 restricted blood flow to the hands, which can cause them to feel cold, numb and painful\nkidney problems \u2013 such as inflammation or kidney stones\nan underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) \u2013 which can lead to tiredness and weight gain\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u2013 which can cause abdominal pain and irregular bowel movements\nteeth cavities\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body.\nThe most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new\u00a0mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected.\nIn most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than 1 colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed.\nAn 'ABCDE checklist' has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma.\u00a0\nRead more about the symptoms of melanoma.\nThese pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the UK.\nNodular melanoma\nNodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren't regularly exposed to the sun.\nLentigo maligna melanoma\nLentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years.\nAcral lentiginous melanoma\u00a0\nAcral lentiginous melanoma\u00a0is\u00a0a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin.\nCancer Research UK has more information about the different types of melanoma.\nWhy does melanoma happen?\nMelanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It's thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible.\nCertain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having:\n\nlots of moles or freckles\npale skin that burns easily\nred or blonde hair\na family member who has had melanoma\n\nRead more about the causes of melanoma.\nDiagnosing melanoma\nSpeak to your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma.\nIn most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. This is known as a biopsy.\nYou may also have a test to check if the melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. This is known as a\u00a0sentinel node biopsy.\nRead more about diagnosing melanoma.\nHow is melanoma treated?\nThe main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances.\nIf melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an\u00a0early stage, surgery is usually successful.\nIf melanoma isn't diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. This usually involves medicines, such as chemotherapy.\nRead more about treating melanoma.\nOnce\u00a0you\u00a0have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. This risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe.\nIf your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns.\nWho is affected\nMelanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK.\nMore than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It's also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds.\nCan melanoma be prevented?\nMelanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light.\nYou can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided.\nRegularly checking your\u00a0moles and freckles\u00a0can help lead to early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.\n\n\nThe first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole.\nNormal\u00a0moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and\u00a0no\u00a0bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months.\nSigns to look out for include a mole that is:\n\ngetting bigger\nchanging shape\nchanging colour\nbleeding or becoming crusty\nitchy or painful\n\nA\u00a0helpful\u00a0way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist:\n\nAsymmetrical \u2013 melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape\nBorder \u2013 melanomas have a notched or ragged border\nColours \u2013 melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours\nDiameter \u2013 melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.\nEnlargement or elevation \u2013 a mole that changes size over time\u00a0is more likely to be a melanoma\n\nMelanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly\u00a0appear on the\u00a0back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail.\nIn rare cases, melanoma can develop in\u00a0the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be\u00a0diagnosed during a routine eye examination.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Melanoma symptoms\n\n\n\nMost skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight.\nSunlight contains 3 types of UV light:\n\nultraviolet A (UVA)\nultraviolet B (UVB)\nultraviolet C (UVC)\n\nUVC is filtered out by the Earth's atmosphere, but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of skin cancer.\nArtificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.\nRepeated sunburn, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, increases the risk of melanoma in people of all ages.\nMoles\nYou\u00a0are at an increased\u00a0risk of melanoma if you have\u00a0lots of\u00a0moles\u00a0on your body, especially if they are large\u00a0(over 5mm) or unusually shaped.\nHaving just 1 unusually shaped or very large mole increases your risk of melanoma by 60%.\nFor this reason, it's important to monitor moles for changes and avoid exposing them to the sun.\nFamily history\nResearch suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.\nIncreased risk\nCertain\u00a0things\u00a0are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including:\n\npale skin that does not tan easily\nred or blonde hair\nblue eyes\nolder age\na large number of freckles\nan area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment\na condition that suppresses your immune system \u2013 such as HIV\nmedicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) \u2013 commonly used after organ transplants\nexposure to certain chemicals \u2013 such as creosote and arsenic\na previous diagnosis of skin cancer\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Melanoma risks and causes.\n\n\n\nA diagnosis of melanoma will usually begin with an examination of your skin. Your GP will refer you to a specialist if they suspect melanoma.\nSome GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.\nAs melanoma is a relatively rare condition, many GPs will only see a case every few years. It's important\u00a0to monitor your moles and return to your GP if you notice any changes. Taking photos to document any changes will help with diagnosis.\nSeeing a specialist\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of malignant melanoma and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected\u00a0malignant melanoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nYou will be referred to a dermatology clinic or hospital\u00a0for further testing if melanoma is suspected. You should see a specialist within 2 weeks of seeing your GP.\nThe\u00a0dermatologist\u00a0or plastic surgeon will examine the mole and the rest of your skin. They may\u00a0also remove the mole and send it for testing (biopsy) to\u00a0check whether the mole is cancerous. A biopsy is usually carried out under local anaesthetic,\u00a0meaning the area around the mole will be numbed and you won't feel any pain.\nIf cancer is confirmed, you will usually need a further operation, most often carried out by a plastic surgeon, to remove a wider area\u00a0of skin.\nFurther tests\nFurther tests will be carried out if there is a concern the cancer has spread into other organs, bones or your bloodstream.\nIf melanoma spreads, it will usually begin spreading through channels in the skin (called lymphatics) to the nearest group of glands (called lymph nodes).\u00a0Lymph nodes\u00a0are part of the body\u2019s immune system, helping to remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body.\nSentinel lymph node biopsy is a test to determine whether microscopic amounts of melanoma (less than would show up on any X-ray or scan) might have spread to the lymph nodes. It is usually carried out by a specialist plastic surgeon, while you are under general anaesthetic.\nA combination of blue dye and a weak radioactive chemical is injected around your scar. This is usually done just before the wider\u00a0area\u00a0of skin is removed. The solution follows the same channels in the skin as any melanoma.\nThe first lymph node this reaches\u00a0is known as\u00a0the 'sentinel' lymph node. The surgeon can\u00a0locate and remove the sentinel node, leaving the others intact. The node is then examined for microscopic specks of melanoma\u00a0(this process can take several weeks).\nIf the sentinel lymph node is clear of melanoma, it's extremely unlikely that any other lymph nodes are affected. This can be reassuring\u00a0because if melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, it's more likely to spread elsewhere.\nIf the sentinel lymph node contains melanoma, there is a risk that other lymph nodes in the same group will contain melanoma.\nYour surgeon should discuss the pros and cons of having a sentinel lymph node biopsy before you agree to the procedure. Sentinel lymph node biopsy does not cure melanoma, but\u00a0is used to investigate the outlook of your condition.\nAn operation to remove the remaining lymph nodes in the group\u00a0may be recommended. This is known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.\nOther tests you may have include:\n\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\na magnetic resonance imaging\u00a0(MRI) scan\na positron emission tomography (PET) scan\nblood tests\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Melanoma tests\nCancer Research UK: Further tests for melanoma\n\n\n\nMelanoma stages\nHealth professionals use a staging system to describe how far melanoma has grown into the skin (the thickness) and whether it has spread. The type of treatment you receive will depend on what stage the melanoma has reached.\nThe melanoma stages can be described as:\n\nstage 0 \u2013 the melanoma is on the surface of the skin\nstage 1A \u2013 the melanoma is less than 1mm thick\nstage 1B \u2013 the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick, or the melanoma is less than 1mm thick and the surface of the skin is broken (ulcerated) or its cells are dividing faster than usual (mitotic activity)\nstage 2A \u2013 the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick, or the melanoma is 1 to 2mm thick and is ulcerated\nstage 2B \u2013 the melanoma is thicker than 4mm, or the melanoma is 2 to 4mm thick and ulcerated\nstage 2C \u2013 the melanoma is thicker than 4mm and ulcerated\nstage 3A \u2013 the melanoma has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, but they are not enlarged; the melanoma is not ulcerated and has not spread further\nstage 3B \u2013 the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1\u00a0to 3 nearby lymph nodes but they are not enlarged, or the melanoma is not ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread to small areas of skin or lymphatic channels, but not to nearby lymph nodes\nstage 3C \u2013 the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or\u00a0the melanoma has spread into 4 or more lymph nodes nearby\nstage 4 \u2013 the melanoma cells have spread to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, brain or other parts of the skin\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Treating melanoma\nCancer Research UK: Stages of melanoma\nMacmillan: Melanoma\n\nStage 1 melanoma\nTreating stage 1 melanoma will involve surgically removing the melanoma and a small area of skin around it \u2013 this is known as surgical excision.\nSurgical excision\u00a0is usually\u00a0carried out\u00a0under local anaesthetic. This means you will be awake but the area around the melanoma will be numbed, so you won't feel pain. In some cases, general anaesthetic is used, which means you will be asleep during the procedure.\nIf a surgical excision is likely to leave a significant scar, it may be done in combination with a skin graft. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually\u00a0taken from a part of your body where scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. Skin grafts or flaps are used when the area of skin being removed is too big to close using a direct method.\nOnce the melanoma has been removed, there is little possibility it will return and no further treatment should be required. You will probably be asked to come for follow-up appointments before being discharged.\u00a0\nStage 2 and 3 melanoma\nAs with stage\u00a01 melanomas, any affected areas of skin will be removed.\u00a0The remaining skin is\u00a0either closed directly, or a skin graft or flap may be\u00a0carried out\u00a0if necessary.\nSentinel node biopsy\nSentinel node biopsy, which is not a mandatory procedure, will be discussed with you. If you decide to go ahead\u00a0with the procedure\u00a0and the results show no spread to nearby lymph nodes, it is unlikely you will have further problems with this melanoma.\nIf the test confirms melanoma has spread to nearby nodes, your specialist will discuss with you whether further surgery is required. Additional surgery involves removing the remaining nodes, known as a completion lymph node\u00a0dissection or completion lymphadenectomy.\nLymph nodes\nIf the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes, you may need further surgery to remove them. Your doctor will\u00a0have felt a lump in your lymph nodes and\u00a0the diagnosis of melanoma is usually confirmed using a needle biopsy (fine needle aspiration).\u00a0Removing the affected nodes requires a procedure called a block dissection, performed under general anaesthetic.\nWhile the surgeon will try to ensure\u00a0the rest of your lymphatic system can function normally, there is a risk that the removal of lymph nodes will disrupt the lymphatic system, leading to a build-up of fluids in your limbs. This is known as lymphoedema.\nFollow-up\nOnce the melanoma has been removed, you will need follow-up appointments to see how you are recovering and to watch for any sign of the melanoma returning.\nYou may be offered treatment to try to prevent the melanoma\u00a0returning. This is called adjuvant treatment. There is not much evidence that adjuvant treatment helps prevent melanoma from coming back, so this is only offered as part of a clinical trial.\nStage 4 melanoma\nIt may not be possible to cure melanoma if it has:\n\nbeen\u00a0diagnosed at its most advanced stage\nspread to another part of your body (metastasis)\ncome back in another part of your body after treatment (recurrent cancer)\n\nTreatment is available and given in the hope that it can slow the cancer's growth, reduce any symptoms you may have and possibly extend your life expectancy.\nYou may be able to have surgery to remove other melanomas that have occurred away from the original site.\nYou may also be able to have other treatments to help with symptoms. These include:\n\nradiotherapy\u00a0\ndrug treatments\n\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0may be used after an operation to remove your lymph nodes, and can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of advanced melanoma.\nRadiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It is given at the hospital as a series of 10 to 15 minute daily sessions, with a rest period over the weekend.\nThe side effects of radiotherapy include:\n\ntiredness\nnausea\nloss of appetite\nhair loss\nsore skin\n\nMany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe, so let them know about any that you experience. After treatment has finished, the side effects of radiotherapy should gradually reduce.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Radiotherapy for melanoma.\n\nDrug treatment\nIn recent years there have been major advancements in treating melanoma. The medications used to treat melanoma are changing as new formulations are being introduced into clinics.\nThe medications currently being used include:\n\nvemurafenib\nipilimumab\nnivolumab\n\nHowever, not everyone is suitable for these drugs. Your specialist will discuss an appropriate treatment with you, and many people are entered into clinical trials.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to kill the cancer.\u00a0It is normally used to treat melanoma that has spread to parts of the body and is mainly given to help relieve symptoms of advanced melanoma.\nSeveral different chemotherapy drugs are used to treat melanoma and are occasionally given in combination. The drugs most commonly used for melanoma are dacarbazine and temozolomide. However, many different types of drugs can be used. Your specialist can discuss with you which drugs are the most suitable.\nChemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. Dacarbazine is given through a drip and temozolomide is given in tablet form. Chemotherapy sessions are usually given once every 3 to 4 weeks, with gaps between treatment intended to give your body and blood time to recover.\nThe main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on the rest of the body. Side effects include infection, nausea and vomiting, tiredness and sore mouth. Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.\nElectrochemotherapy\nElectrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for melanoma. It may be considered if:\n\nsurgery isn't suitable or hasn't worked\nradiotherapy and chemotherapy haven't worked\n\nThe procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein).\u00a0Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.\nThese electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour.\u00a0The procedure\u00a0is usually\u00a0carried out using general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) but some people may\u00a0be able to have\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're awake but the area is numbed).\nDepending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.\nIt usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.\nYour specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.\nRead the NICE (2013) guidelines on Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy uses drugs (often derived from substances that occur naturally in the body) that encourage your body's immune system to work against the melanoma. Two such treatments in regular use for melanoma are\u00a0interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. Both are given as an injection (into the blood, under the skin, or into lumps of melanoma).\nSide effects include flu-like symptoms, such as chills, a high temperature, joint pain and fatigue.\nVaccines\nThere is ongoing research\u00a0into producing a vaccine for melanoma, either to treat advanced melanoma or to be used\u00a0after surgery in patients who have a high risk of the melanoma coming back.\nVaccines are designed to focus the body\u2019s immune system so it recognises the melanoma and can work against it. Vaccines are usually given as an injection under the skin every few weeks, often over a period of months.\nAs more research is needed into vaccines, they are only given as part of a clinical trial.\nMonoclonal antibodies\nOur immune systems make antibodies all the time, usually as a way of controlling infections. They are substances that recognise something which doesn\u2019t belong in the body and help to destroy it. Antibodies can be produced in the laboratory and can be made to recognise and lock onto specific targets, either in the cancer or in specific parts of the body.\nAntibodies produced in the laboratory are usually called monoclonal antibodies.\nIpilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been licensed for use in the UK since 2011. It works like an accelerator for the immune system, allowing the body to work against all sorts of conditions, including cancer.\nIn December 2012, NICE recommended ipilimumab as a possible treatment for people with previously treated advanced melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.\nSignalling inhibitors\nSignalling inhibitors are drugs that work by disrupting the messages (signals) a cancer uses to co-ordinate its growth. There are hundreds of these signals, and it is difficult to know which ones need to be blocked. Most of the signals have short, technical names. Two that are of current interest in relation to melanoma are BRAF and MEK.\nThere are drugs available that can interfere with these signals, but most are currently only widely available as part of clinical trials.\nNICE recommends a signalling inhibitor called vemurafenib as a possible treatment for melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Biological therapy for melanoma.\nCancer Research UK: Chemotherapy for melanoma.\n\nClinical trials\nAll new treatment for cancer (and other diseases) is first given to patients in a clinical trial.\nA clinical trial or study is an extremely rigorous way of testing a drug on people. Patients are monitored for any effects of the drug on the cancer, as well as side effects. Many people with melanoma are offered entry into clinical trials, but some people are suspicious of the process.\nThere are a few key things to know about clinical trials:\n\noverall, patients in clinical trials do better than those on routine treatment, even when receiving a drug that would be given routinely\nall clinical trials are highly regulated\nall new treatments will first become available through clinical trials\neven where a new drug fails to offer any benefits over existing treatment, the knowledge that we gain from the trial is valuable for future patients\n\nIf you are asked to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Melanoma research.\n\nDeciding against treatment for stage 4 melanoma\nMany of the treatments described have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life. You may decide against having treatment if it is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy, or if you do not have symptoms causing you pain or discomfort.\nThis is entirely your decision and your healthcare team will respect it. If you decide not to receive treatment, pain relief and nursing care will be made available when you need it. This is called palliative care.\nRead further information:\n\nAccessing palliative care\nCancer Research UK: Advanced melanoma (stage 4)\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin.\nThe term 'non-melanoma' distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as melanoma, which spreads faster in the body.\nThe first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn't heal after a few weeks.\nIn most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly.\nSpeak to your GP if you have any skin abnormality that hasn't healed after 4 weeks. Although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure.\nRead more about the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer\nTypes of non-melanoma skin cancer\nNon-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop.\nThe 2 most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are:\n\nbasal cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers\nsquamous cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers\n\nAlthough not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratoses\u00a0and Bowen's disease\u00a0may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.\nWhy does it happen?\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps.\nIn addition to UV light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as:\n\na family history of the condition\npale skin that burns easily\na large number of moles or freckles\n\nRead more about the causes of non-melanoma skin cancer\nWho is affected?\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. It affects slightly more men than women.\nDiagnosis\nYour GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer.\nYour GP may refer you urgently, within 2 weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancers usually don't need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks. Read a guide to NHS waiting times.\nThe specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer.\nA biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope.\nRead more about diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer\nTreating non-melanoma skin cancer\nSurgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. This involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin.\nOther treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT).\nTreatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.\nIt is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2 to 5% of cases.\nTreatment for\u00a0non-melanoma skin cancer\u00a0is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases.\nRead more about treating non-melanoma skin cancer\nComplications\nIf you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe.\nIf your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours.\nPrevention\nNon-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to UV light.\nYou can help protect yourself from\u00a0sunburn by using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day.\nSunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided.\nRegularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.\nRead more about sunscreen and sun safety\n\n\nThe main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is the appearance of a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn't heal.\nThe lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour.\nNon-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and\u00a0shoulders.\nBasal cell carcinoma\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually\u00a0appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or 'waxy' looking.\u00a0It can also look like a red, scaly patch.\nThe lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.\nSquamous cell carcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump\u00a0and may have\u00a0a flat, scaly and crusted surface.\nThe lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.\nBowen's disease is a very early form of skin cancer, sometimes referred to as 'squamous cell carcinoma in situ'. It develops slowly and is easily\u00a0treated.\u00a0\nThe main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin which may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of the skin.\nWhen to\u00a0seek medical advice\nIf you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn't healed after 4 weeks, speak to your GP. While it is unlikely to be cancer, it is best to be sure.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Skin cancer symptoms\nMacmillan:\u00a0Symptoms of skin cancer\n\n\n\nMost skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight.\nSunlight contains 3 types of UV light:\n\nultraviolet A (UVA)\nultraviolet B (UVB)\nultraviolet C (UVC)\n\nUVC is filtered out by the Earth's atmosphere but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer.\nArtificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer.\nRepeated sunburn, either by the sun or artificial sources of light, will make your skin more vulnerable to non-melanoma skin cancer.\nFamily history\nResearch suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased.\nIncreased risk\nCertain factors are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including:\n\npale skin that does not tan easily\nred or blonde hair\nblue eyes\nolder age\na large number of moles\na large number of freckles\nan area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment\na condition that suppresses your immune system, such as HIV\nmedicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants), commonly used after organ transplants\nexposure to certain chemicals, such as creosote and arsenic\na previous diagnosis of skin cancer\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Skin cancer risks and causes.\nMacmillan: Risk factors and causes of skin cancer.\n\n\n\nA diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer will usually begin with a visit to your GP who will examine your skin and decide whether you need further assessment by a specialist.\nSome GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of\u00a0skin cancer\u00a0and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected skin cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nBiopsy\nIf skin cancer is suspected, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or specialist plastic surgeon. The specialist should be able to confirm the diagnosis by carrying out a physical examination.\nHowever, they will probably also\u00a0perform a biopsy \u2013 a surgical procedure where either a part or all of the tumour is removed and studied under a microscope. This is usually carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area will be numbed so you won't feel pain.\nThis allows the dermatologist or plastic surgeon to determine what type of skin cancer you have and whether there is any chance the cancer could spread to other parts of your body.\nSometimes, skin cancer can be diagnosed and treated at the same time. In other words, the tumour can be removed and tested and you may not need further treatment because the cancer is unlikely to spread.\nIt may be several weeks before you receive the results of a biopsy.\nFurther tests\nIf you have basal cell carcinoma (BCC), then you usually won't require further tests, as the cancer is unlikely to spread.\nHowever, in rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, further tests may be needed to make sure the cancer has not spread to another part of your body.\nThese tests may include a physical examination of your lymph nodes (glands found throughout your body). If cancer has spread, it may cause your glands to swell.\nIf the dermatologist or plastic surgeon thinks there is a high risk of the cancer spreading, it may be necessary to perform a biopsy on a lymph node. This is called a fine needle aspiration (FNA).\nDuring FNA, cells are removed using a needle and syringe so they can be examined. Finding cancerous cells in a nearby lymph node would suggest the squamous cell carcinoma has started to spread to other parts of your body.\n\n\nSurgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer, although it may depend on your individual circumstances.\nOverall, treatment is successful for more than 90% of people with non-melanoma skin cancer.\nPeople with cancer should be cared for by a team of specialists that often includes a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, an oncologist (a radiotherapy and chemotherapy specialist), a pathologist and a specialist nurse.\nIf you have non-melanoma skin cancer, you may see several (or all) of these professionals as part of your treatment.\nWhen deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider:\n\nthe type of cancer you have\nthe stage of your cancer (how big it is and how far it has spread)\nyour general health\n\nYour cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced healthcare guidelines about NHS skin cancer services. These outline NICE\u2019s main recommendations on how, over the coming years, people with skin cancer or melanoma should be treated.\nRead further information:\n\nNICE: improving outcomes for people with skin tumours including melanoma\n\nSurgical excision\nSurgical excision is an\u00a0operation to\u00a0cut out the cancer along with surrounding healthy tissue to ensure the cancer is completely removed.\nIt may be done in combination with a skin graft, if\u00a0it's likely to leave significant scarring. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually from a part of your body where any scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area.\nIn many cases, this operation is enough to cure skin cancer.\nCurettage and electrocautery\nCurettage and electrocautery is a similar technique to surgical excision, but is only suitable for cases where the cancer is quite small.\nThe surgeon will use a small, spoon-shaped blade to remove the cancer and an electric needle to remove the skin surrounding the wound. The procedure may need to be repeated two or three times to ensure the cancer is completely removed.\nCryotherapy\nCryotherapy uses cold treatment to destroy the cancer. It is sometimes used for non-melanoma skin cancers in their early stages. Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze the cancer, and this causes the area to scab over.\nAfter about a month, the scab containing the cancer will fall off your skin. Cryotherapy may leave a small white scar on your skin.\nMohs micrographic surgery\nMohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is used to treat non-melanoma skin cancers when:\n\nit's felt there is a high risk of the cancer spreading or returning\nthe cancer is in an area where it would be important to remove as little skin as possible, such as the nose or eyes\n\nIt involves removing the tumour bit by bit, as well as a small area of skin surrounding it. This minimises the removal of healthy tissue and reduces scarring.\nEach time a piece of tissue is removed, it is checked for cancer. The procedure may need to be repeated 2 or 3 times to ensure\u00a0the cancer is completely removed.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy involves using medicines to kill cancerous cells. In the case of non-melanoma skin cancer, chemotherapy is only recommended when the tumour is contained within the top layer of the skin.\nThis type of chemotherapy involves applying a cream containing cancer-killing medicines to the affected area. As only the surface of the skin is affected, you will not experience the side effects associated with other forms of chemotherapy, such as vomiting or hair loss. However, your skin may feel sore for several weeks afterwards.\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT)\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat basal cell carcinoma,\u00a0Bowen's disease and actinic keratoses. It involves using a cream which makes the skin highly sensitive to light.\nAfter the cream has been applied, a strong light source is shone onto the affected area of your skin, which kills the cancer. PDT may cause a burning sensation and around 2% of people who have this treatment will be left with some superficial scarring.\nImiquimod cream\nImiquimod cream is a treatment for basal cell carcinoma with a diameter of less than 2cm (0.8 inches). It's also used to treat actinic keratoses. Imiquimod encourages your immune system to attack the cancer in the skin.\nCommon side effects of imiquimod include redness, flaking or peeling skin\u00a0and itchiness.\nLess common and more serious side effects of imiquimod include blistering or ulceration of your skin.\nWash the cream off and contact your GP if your skin blisters or you develop ulcers after using it.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy involves using low doses of radiation to destroy the cancer. The level of radiation involved is perfectly safe. However, your skin may feel sore for a few weeks after radiotherapy.\nRadiotherapy is sometimes used to treat basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas if:\n\nsurgery would be unsuitable\nthe cancer covers a large area\nthe area is difficult to operate on\n\nRadiotherapy is sometimes used after surgical excision to try to prevent the cancer coming back. This is called adjuvant radiotherapy.\nElectrochemotherapy\nElectrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. It may be considered if:\n\nsurgery isn't suitable or hasn't worked\nradiotherapy and chemotherapy haven't worked\n\nThe procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein).\u00a0Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes.\nThese electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. The procedure\u00a0is usually\u00a0carried out using general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) but some people may\u00a0be able to have\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're awake but the area is numbed).\nDepending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers.\nIt usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear\u00a0and the procedure usually needs to be repeated.\nYour specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option.\nRead the NICE (2013) guidelines on Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: Treating skin cancer.\nMacmillan: Treatment for skin cancer.\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "This section is for teenagers and young adults.

This is called osteosarcoma.\u00a0\nSigns and symptoms of soft tissue sarcomas\nThe symptoms of a sarcoma will depend on where it is:\n\nif it\u2019s in an arm or leg, symptoms include a lump or swelling in the limb \u2013 this is usually painless, but not always\nif it\u2019s in the tummy (abdomen), symptoms include a painful, swollen tummy, and problems going to the toilet to poo (called constipation)\nif it\u2019s in your bladder, symptoms include pain in the lower tummy, finding it difficult to pee (pass urine), and having blood in your pee\nif it\u2019s in the chest, symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough and pain in your chest\nif it\u2019s in the head or neck, symptoms include a lump, a blockage and discharge from the nose or throat;\u00a0occasionally an eye may become swollen and stick out a bit\n\nYou may also have other symptoms, such as tiredness, loss of appetite or weight loss.\nRemember \u2013 most people with these symptoms won\u2019t have a sarcoma. \u00a0But if you have any of these symptoms, or are worried that you may have a sarcoma, the first thing to do is to speak to your GP. They'll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor.\nCauses\nIt's unknown what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.\nPeople often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there\u2019s no evidence for this.\nRemember that nothing you\u2019ve done has caused the cancer.\nTypes of soft tissue sarcoma\nThis type of sarcoma grows in the active muscles of the body. These are muscles that we have control over, like the muscles we use to move our arms or legs. Rhabdomyosarcomas are most likely to happen in the head, neck, bladder, vagina, arms, legs and trunk.\u00a0\nThere are different types or rhabdomyosarcoma. The most likely one to happen in teenagers and young adults is called an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and affects an arm or a leg.\u00a0\nTo find out more look at\u00a0Macmillan's rhabdomyosarcoma\u00a0information that is written for all ages.\nThis type of sarcoma is most likely to happen in the tissue around the joints, like your elbow, knee and ankle. It can also happen in other parts of your body, but that is less common. This type of sarcoma might not be obvious straight away because the lump grows slowly and is usually not sore.\u00a0\nIf you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma, it's treated in the same way as a Ewing\u2019s sarcoma in a bone. You can read more about this in Macmillan's bone cancer section.\nThis type of sarcoma happens in the fibrous tissue in your body. Fibrous tissue joins the structures inside your body together \u2013 like your muscles to bones. You\u2019re most likely to find a fibrosarcoma on your arms, legs or trunk, but they can happen deeper in your body.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nWe also have more information about:\n\nthe\u00a0soft tissue\nhaving tests for a soft tissue sarcoma\ntreatment for a soft tissue sarcoma\u00a0\nliving with a soft tissue sarcoma\n\nIf you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma information.\n\n\nThe soft tissues of the body connect, surround and support other body tissue and organs. Soft tissue includes muscle, cartilage, fat, fibrous tissue, nerves and blood vessels.\nTypes of soft tissue sarcoma\nSoft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body.\nThere are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are:\u00a0\n\nrhabdomyosarcomas\u00a0\nsynovial sarcomas\u00a0\nfibrosarcomas\n\nThere are also bone sarcomas.\nDoctors can tell the type of soft tissue sarcoma by closely examining the sample of tissue that\u2019s been removed (called a biopsy) under a microscope.\nThese develop from muscle and the surrounding tissue. There are 2 main types that affect younger people:\n\nalveolar rhabdomyosarcomas\u00a0\u2013 these are more common in teenagers and young adults and are usually found in an arm or leg (limb), or in the muscles of the chest or tummy (abdomen)\nembryonal rhabdomyosarcomas \u2013 these are more common in children and can start in a number of areas, for example, around the eye, where the throat joins with the nose, the bladder, the womb, or the vagina\n\nThese usually develop near to but not inside joints, such as the knee or elbow. But they can develop anywhere in the body. They usually appear as hard lumps.\nThese start in cells called fibrocytes, which form the tissue that helps join parts of our body together, such as joining the muscles to the bones. Fibrosarcomas are usually found in the arms, legs or torso, but can also start in areas deeper in the body.\nThe information in this section covers the common types of soft tissue sarcoma, but if you have a different one and want to know more, please contact Macmillan.\u00a0\u00a0\nCauses\nIt's unknown\u00a0what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults.\nRemember that nothing you\u2019ve done has caused the cancer.\u00a0\nSome rare conditions that run in families (known as genetic conditions) can increase the chance (risk) of getting a soft tissue sarcoma. You would usually know if anyone in your family had one of these conditions.\nPeople who had radiotherapy for another type of cancer when they were a child may have an increased risk of developing a sarcoma in later life \u2013 this would be from their teens onwards.\u00a0\nPeople often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there\u2019s no evidence for this.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nhaving tests for a soft tissue sarcoma\ntreatment for a soft tissue sarcoma\u00a0\u00a0\nliving with a soft tissue sarcoma\n\nIf you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma information.\n\n\nThere are some tests you might have at your GP surgery or at the hospital. These tests will help the doctors see whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma.\nVisiting your GP\nIf you think you might have some of the symptoms of a soft tissue sarcoma, you should go to your GP. They'll be able to talk to you about your symptoms, and they can arrange tests to find out more.\nThey\u2019ll examine you and usually arrange for some tests, such as X-rays. There may be a number of reasons why you're feeling unwell, so it can be difficult to diagnose the problem straight away. If your GP can't find the cause, you'll be referred to a specialist at the hospital.\nAt the hospital\nTo begin with, you may see a specialist at a general hospital for more tests. If your GP suspects you have a soft tissue sarcoma, they may refer you directly to a sarcoma specialist.\nIf you're diagnosed with a sarcoma and you\u2019re not already seeing a specialist, you\u2019ll be referred to one. You'll probably see a lot of doctors, nurses and other staff.\nYour hospital doctor will examine you and arrange for some of the\u00a0following tests, which Macmillan have information on:\n\nX-rays\nbone scans\nultrasound scans\nMRI, CT or PET scans\nbiopsies\nbone marrow tests\n\nYou won't necessarily need all of these tests.\nIf the tests show that you have a sarcoma, you might need a few more tests to check how your body is working in general. Macmillan have information on these, including:\n\nblood tests\ntests to check your heart is healthy, including an echocardiogram or\u00a0electrocardiogram (ECG), or a nuclear medicine scan (MUGA scan)\ntests to check your kidneys are healthy, which can involve blood tests or having your wee (urine) collected for a period of time or a nuclear medicine blood test (GFR)\n\nThis may seem like a lot of tests, but they\u2019ll help the doctors plan the best treatment for you.\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from family, friends and your specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier.\u00a0 You can also use\u00a0Macmillan's online community for young people that have had similar experiences or are going through the same as you.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe also have more information about:\n\nthe soft tissue\ntreatment for a soft tissue sarcoma\nliving with a soft tissue sarcoma\n\nIf you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma information.\n\n\nThis section is for teenagers and young adults.

There are different types of soft tissue sarcoma, and the information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas and fibrosarcomas, which are the most common types in teenagers.\nIf you have a different type and want to know more, please contact Macmillan.\nThe 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\nMost people have a combination of treatments. Your doctors will plan your treatment based on:\n\nthe\u00a0type of sarcoma you have\nthe stage of the cancer (how big it is and whether it has spread from where it started)\nthe grade of the cancer (how fast-growing the cancer cells are).\n\nIf you have any questions about your treatment, ask your doctor or nurse. They\u2019ll be happy to help you understand what's involved.\nIf you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma, it's treated in the same way as a Ewing\u2019s sarcoma in a bone.\nChemotherapy\nThis is when you're given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells. For soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy can be given in a number of situations:\n\nbefore surgery \u2013 to shrink the tumour\nafter surgery \u2013 to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, and to treat cancer cells that have spread\nwhen it isn\u2019t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation\n\nFor soft tissue sarcomas, chemotherapy\u00a0is given into a vein, usually through a central line, a port or a PICC line. You can find out more about\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0and how it's given.\nYou\u2019ll have chemotherapy\u00a0over a few days, then you\u2019ll have a few weeks off so that your body can recover from any side effects. The days you have the chemotherapy\u00a0and the rest period afterwards are called a cycle. Most people have several cycles of chemotherapy.\nYou'll probably need to stay in hospital for some of the time during chemotherapy, but it\u2019s often possible to have part of your treatment as an outpatient.\nDifferent chemotherapy drugs are used for soft tissue sarcomas, and you\u2019ll usually have 2 or 3 drugs in combination. This is sometimes called a regimen or treatment plan. Your doctor will decide which regimen or treatment plan is best for you depending on the grade and stage of your sarcoma. You may have chemotherapy treatment as part of a clinical research trial. It will be your decision whether or not you take part in a trial. Your doctor will explain it fully before you make the choice if there is a trial that is right for you.\nSome of the main chemotherapy drugs for soft tissue sarcomas are:\n\nifosfamide\nvincristine\nactinomycin D\ndoxorubicin\ncyclophosphamide\ncisplatin\n\nIf you have a rhabdomyosarcoma, you may be given ifosfamide, vincristine and actinomycin. Giving these drugs together is called IVA.\nYou might also be given ifosfamide, vincristine actinomycin and doxorubicin. Giving these drugs together is called IVADO.\nMacmillan have more information about chemotherapy, including information about\u00a0individual drugs and combinations of drugs, IVA and IVADO chemotherapy. This is written for anyone who's looking for information about chemotherapy, not just for young adults.\nOther types of soft tissue sarcoma can be treated with different combinations of drugs, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, or vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide. Your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about the type of chemotherapy you\u2019re going to have and how many cycles you\u2019ll need.\nDifferent chemotherapy\u00a0drugs cause different side effects. Some people have just a few side effects and others have more. It's hard to know how it's going to be for you, as everyone is different. The most common are hair loss, tiredness, sickness and being more at risk of getting an infection.\nSide effects can often be controlled, so always let your doctor or nurse know about the side effects you\u2019re having. They can usually do something to improve them. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.\nIf you want to know more about the type of chemotherapy\u00a0you\u2019re having and its side effects, there\u2019s lots more information in\u00a0Macmillan's chemotherapy section.\nSurgery\nSurgery to remove the cancer is one of the main treatments for soft tissue sarcomas. Your surgeon will aim to remove all of the cancer, and at the same time reduce any long-term effects as much as possible.\nThe operation you have will depend on the size of the sarcoma and where it is in your body. You might meet other people with the same type of sarcoma who have had a different operation. Everyone is different. Your cancer doctor and specialist nurse will talk to you about your operation and make sure you understand why you need to have it and what's involved. Below are some of the different types of operation you might have for a soft tissue sarcoma.\nWe also have more information about what will happen before and after the operation in our surgery section.\nYou may have an operation called a wide local excision to remove the cancer and an area of tissue surrounding it (called the margin). This tissue is checked to make sure it doesn\u2019t contain any cancer cells. Sometimes the surgeon also removes some of the lymph nodes (glands) near the cancer to find out if there are any cancer cells there. If there are cancer cells in the margin or lymph nodes, some people may need to have more surgery.\nIf you need to have a large area of tissue removed, you may need to have a skin graft or soft tissue graft. This is when skin and sometimes muscle is taken from a different part of the body to place over the area where the sarcoma was removed from. This is called plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery. It\u2019s done to give you as natural an appearance as possible and to make sure you can still do the things you did before your operation. Both operation sites will gradually heal over a few weeks after the operation.\nIf the sarcoma is in an arm or leg you may have limb-sparing surgery. This means the surgeon takes away the cancer without removing the arm or leg. You\u2019ll have all of the tumour taken away from your limb, as well as any bone and muscle affected by the tumour.\nThe surgeon then replaces what they\u2019ve taken away. This may involve using plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery (see skin graft or soft tissue graft) to replace the tissue that\u2019s been removed, or it may involve surgery to replace any bone that\u2019s been removed. If you need to have bone removed, the surgeon replaces it with a specially designed metal implant called an endoprosthesis.\nIf the cancer affects a bone in or near a joint, your joint can be replaced with an artificial one.\nYour physiotherapist might give you exercises before your operation to strengthen your muscles.\nIf you've had chemotherapy, you'll need 2 or 3 weeks to recover from the treatment before you can have your operation. Doctors will check that your blood count has returned to normal. They'll also make sure that you're well enough to have the operation. If you\u2019ve lost weight or been off your food, you might need to build yourself up a bit. The hospital dietitian can help you do this. You\u2019ll probably also see a physiotherapist, who\u2019ll give you exercises to do to strengthen your muscles.\nIf you want to have a look at the endoprosthesis that will be put in during your surgery, your nurse or surgeon can usually arrange this.\nYou\u2019ll have a bandage or splint on your limb to keep it still and let it heal.\nYou\u2019ll probably have a tube, called a drain, coming out of your wound. This stops fluid building up in your wound. A nurse will take it out after about 3 to 4 days or when there isn\u2019t very much fluid coming out of the wound.\nYou won\u2019t feel like eating or drinking much for a few hours after your operation, so you\u2019ll be given fluids into a vein.\nYou\u2019ll probably feel a bit sore to begin with, but you\u2019ll be given strong painkillers to help. It\u2019s important to tell the nurses if you need extra pain relief. The pain usually starts to get better within 2\u00a0to 3 days. As time goes on you'll need fewer painkillers and will start to feel a lot more comfortable. Be honest about how you are feeling to your doctors and nurses and they can make sure that you are comfortable and as pain-free as possible.\nOnce you\u2019re home you\u2019ll probably feel a bit better and stronger every day. But if you do have any problems it\u2019s important to get them treated right away, as a delay could mean they get much more serious.\nIf your new joint starts to stiffen up you may need some more physiotherapy, so tell your doctor so they can arrange this for you.\nIf you notice any new redness, soreness or swelling in the limb that\u2019s been operated on, it\u2019s really important to get in touch with your doctor right away. You might have an infection that needs treatment, so you\u2019ll need to see the surgeon who did your operation without delay.\nThere\u2019s more information about the long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery in our section on living with and after a soft tissue sarcoma.\nAmputation\nVery occasionally the only way to get rid of the cancer is to remove the limb where the sarcoma is growing. This is called an amputation and it\u2019s only ever done if there is no alternative.\nYour doctor will talk things through with you so that you fully understand what\u2019s involved. Losing a limb can feel very scary and you might want to talk to a specialist nurse or a counsellor about your feelings. It might also help to talk to someone who has had an amputation - your nurse or doctor can arrange this. It's really important to get support.\nYou\u2019ll have bandages or a plaster cast on the area that\u2019s been operated on. There\u2019ll be a drain coming from the wound to remove any excess fluid that builds up. The drain is usually taken out by a nurse on the ward after 3 to 4 days or when there is no fluid coming from the wound. You\u2019ll also be given fluid into a vein in your arm until you feel like eating and drinking again.\nYou\u2019ll probably feel a bit sore after your operation, especially for the first 2 to 4 days, but you'll be given strong painkillers to help with this. It\u2019s important to tell the doctors and nurses if you need extra pain relief. You may have pain that feels as if it\u2019s coming from the part of the limb that\u2019s been removed. This is known as phantom pain. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have this. There are medicines that can help ease it or take it away. It usually gets better and goes away in time.\nA physiotherapist will visit you a day or so after your operation. They\u2019ll show you exercises to keep your muscles strong and flexible.\nIf you\u2019ve had an arm removed, you\u2019ll be able to get up and move around once you\u2019ve recovered from the anaesthetic and don\u2019t feel too sore. If you\u2019ve had a leg removed, the physiotherapist will show you how to move around in bed and get from your bed to a chair. You'll probably be moving around with crutches or in a wheelchair within a few days.\nOnce you\u2019re up and around you\u2019ll go to the hospital gym for physiotherapy. This is a big part of your recovery. Your physiotherapist will give you more exercises to do as your wound heals and you get stronger.\nIt\u2019ll take a few months for your limb to heal to its final shape after the operation, so you won\u2019t be fitted with your permanent prosthesis (artificial limb) until this happens. In the meantime, you\u2019ll be given a temporary prosthesis and you\u2019ll start learning how to use it in physiotherapy. A specialist team will help you recover from the operation and get you used to the artificial limb that you\u2019re fitted with.\nYou'll be able to go home about two weeks after your operation.\nYou can read more about recovering after the operation in our information about living with and after a soft tissue sarcoma.\u00a0\nRemember that it may be possible to talk to someone who has been through the same as you. Your doctor or nurse can arrange this.\u00a0 \u00a0\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy X-rays to destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. There\u2019s more information about it in the\u00a0radiotherapy section.\nFor soft tissue sarcomas radiotherapy can be given in a number of situations:\n\nafter surgery \u2013 to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area, or to get rid of any cancer cells that may be left behind; you\u2019ll usually have it about 4 to 6 weeks after the operation, when your wound has healed\nbefore surgery \u2013 to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with an operation\nwhen it isn\u2019t possible to remove the sarcoma with an operation\n\nRadiotherapy is generally given every weekday (Monday to Friday). Each treatment takes a few minutes.\nRadiotherapy isn't painful, but it can cause some side effects. After a few treatments you may begin to feel tired, and your skin may go red or get darker and feel sore or itchy around the area that\u2019s being treated. This gets better once your radiotherapy treatment is over.\nOther side effects depend on which part of your body is being treated. Having radiotherapy around a joint can make it feel stiff, but physiotherapy can help.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nthe soft tissue\nhaving tests for a soft tissue sarcoma\nliving with a soft tissue sarcoma\n\n\u00a0If you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma information.\n\n\nThis information is about life after having surgery for a soft tissue sarcoma. You may find it useful to read the information about surgery first.\nLife after limb-sparing surgery\nThe long-term effects of limb-sparing surgery depend on which part of your body is affected and what kind of operation you have. The best person to ask about your operation is your surgeon.\nAfter limb-sparing surgery the limb might not work as well as it used to. Physiotherapy is an important part of your recovery. You\u2019ll be given exercises to do to help you get your limb working as well as possible. These can be hard work, but it\u2019s important to keep going with them.\nJoint replacements\nIf you\u2019ve had a joint replacement, you\u2019ll be able to walk and swim and do most of the things you could do before, but your doctor might advise you not to play high-impact sports like hockey, football, tennis or rugby. These activities could damage or loosen the new joint. Check with your surgeon about any special instructions they may have for what activities you can do.\n\u00a0If you\u2019ve had a shoulder replacement you might find it harder to lift your arm above your shoulder. After any kind of joint replacement, you will be given physiotherapy. It\u2019s very important to do the exercises your physiotherapist shows you so that you get as much movement back as possible.\nLife after amputation\nAfter amputation most people have an artificial limb, called a prosthesis. There are artificial limbs designed to let you do all types of physical activities, including walking, swimming, running, cycling and playing sports.\nDifferent types of prosthesis let you do different things. Some people have one for wearing day-to-day, and an extra one specially designed for something like swimming or doing athletics.\nHow will I feel?\nYou might feel lots of different emotions. You might be tearful, angry, fed up or depressed at times. You might think you've lost all your confidence and that you'll never be able to live a normal life or be in a relationship. These feelings are normal, and it's important that you get support to help you cope with them. You could talk to:\n\nfamily or friends\na counsellor \u2013 this can be arranged by your doctor or nurse\nother young people in a similar situation, for example through\u00a0Macmillan's\u00a0online community or a support group\n\nShare what you've been through\u00a0with Macmillan's\u00a0online community, which has a group for people who are 16\u00a0to 24 and living with cancer. It's your space to talk freely with other people who understand what you're going through.\nThings will be tough as you get used to living with an amputation, but help is available.\nOther people's reactions can be hard to cope with, too. You might be worried about what your friends think or how they're going to treat you. The thought of going back to school, college or work can be scary. Even people in your family who you are close to might not know what to say or do. Others might say things that sound stupid or seem hurtful.\nTry to choose a couple of really close relatives or friends you can call on when things get you down. You might also find it useful to talk to someone outside your close circle, like a counsellor. Most people find it helps to talk about how they're feeling or what\u2019s on their mind.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nthe soft tissue\nhaving tests for a soft tissue sarcoma\ntreatment for a soft tissue sarcoma\n\nIf you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma information.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, is a fairly uncommon type of cancer.\u00a0\nThe initial\u00a0symptoms of stomach cancer are vague and easy to mistake for other less serious\u00a0conditions.\u00a0They include:\n\npersistent\u00a0indigestion and heartburn\ntrapped wind and frequent burping\nfeeling very full or bloated after meals\npersistent stomach pain\n\nSymptoms of advanced stomach cancer can include:\n\nblood in your stools, or black stools\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\n\nAs the early\u00a0symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to those of many other\u00a0conditions, the cancer is often advanced by the time it's diagnosed. It's therefore important to get any possible symptoms of stomach cancer checked by your GP as soon as possible.\nRead more about diagnosing stomach cancer\nWho's affected\nThe exact cause of stomach cancer is still unclear, although you're more likely to develop it if you:\n\nare male\nare 55 years of age or older\nsmoke\nhave a diet low in fibre and high in processed food or red meat\nhave a diet that contains a lot of salted and pickled foods\nhave a stomach infection caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria\u00a0\n\nRead more about the causes of stomach cancer.\nTypes of stomach cancer\nThere are several different types of stomach cancer. More than 95% of stomach cancers develop in the cells of the stomach lining and are known as adenocarcinomas.\nLess common types of stomach cancer include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue (tissue that drains away fluid and helps fight infection), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which develop in the muscle or connective tissue of the stomach wall.\nHow stomach cancer is treated\nMany cases of stomach cancer can't be completely cured, but it's still possible to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life using chemotherapy\u00a0and in some cases\u00a0radiotherapy and surgery.\nIf operable, surgery can cure stomach cancer as long as all of the cancerous tissue\u00a0can be removed.\nSurgery to remove some or all of the stomach is known as a\u00a0gastrectomy. It will still be possible to eat normally after a gastrectomy, but you'll probably have to adjust the size of your portions.\u00a0\nChemotherapy can also be used before surgery to help shrink the tumour and sometimes after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.\nRead more about treating stomach cancer\nLiving with stomach cancer\nLiving with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social, psychological and financial support.\nRead more about living with stomach cancer\n\n\nMany symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to less serious conditions, so it can be difficult to recognise in the early stages.\nEarly stage symptoms include:\n\npersistent indigestion \ntrapped wind and frequent burping\nheartburn\nfeeling full very quickly when eating\nfeeling bloated after eating\nfeeling sick\npain in your stomach or breastbone\ndifficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\nvomiting (the vomit may be streaked with blood), although this is uncommon in the early stages\n\nAdvanced stomach cancer\nSymptoms of more advanced stomach cancer include:\n\nblood in your stools, or black stools\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\ntiredness\nlumpiness and swelling in your stomach (caused by a build-up of fluid)\nanaemia\u00a0(a reduced number of red blood cells that can cause you to feel tired and breathless)\nyellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\n\nWhen to seek medical help\nStomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it's diagnosed early. It's therefore\u00a0important for your GP to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected.\nStomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age.\nIndigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. However, it's unlikely that someone with indigestion who's under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer.\nHowever,\u00a0see your GP if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. They\u00a0should refer you to a specialist for further testing.\nAlso see your GP if you have difficulty swallowing. This\u00a0isn't a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated.\nRead more about diagnosing stomach cancer\nYou can also read more about being referred to a stomach cancer specialist\u00a0on Cancer Research UK.\u00a0\n\n\nStomach cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the stomach, although it's unclear exactly why these changes occur.\nCancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce\u00a0uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nLeft untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system (a network of vessels and glands called lymph nodes located throughout the body).\nOnce the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it's capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.\nIt's not known what triggers the\u00a0changes in DNA\u00a0that lead to stomach cancer and why only a small number of people develop the condition.\nIncreased risk\nHowever, evidence suggests that a number of different factors can affect your\u00a0chances of developing stomach cancer.\nYour risk of developing stomach cancer increases with age. Most cases occur in people aged 55 or over.\nFor reasons that are unclear, men are twice as likely as women to develop stomach cancer.\nSmoking\nPeople who smoke are about twice as likely to develop stomach cancer compared with non-smokers. This is because you swallow some cigarette smoke when you inhale and it ends up in your stomach. Cigarettes contain\u00a0harmful chemicals which can damage the cells in your stomach.\nThe more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking, the bigger the risk.\u00a0In the UK, around 1\u00a0in every 5 cases of stomach cancer (20%) is thought to be caused by smoking.\nHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori)\u00a0is a common type of bacteria. In most people, these bacteria are harmless, but\u00a0in some people an H. pylori infection can cause problems such as\u00a0stomach ulcers, recurring bouts of\u00a0indigestion or\u00a0long-term inflammation of the stomach lining (chronic atrophic gastritis).\nResearch has found\u00a0people with severe chronic\u00a0atrophic gastritis have\u00a0an increased\u00a0risk of developing stomach cancer, although this risk is still small.\nA diet rich in pickled vegetables, such as pickled onions or piccalilli, salted fish, salt in general and smoked meats, such as pastrami or smoked beef, increases your risk of stomach cancer.\nCountries where this type of diet is popular, such as Japan, tend to have much higher rates of stomach cancer than the UK.\nA high fibre diet with 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day\u00a0will help protect against stomach cancer, and a diet high in fats and processed food and red meat will increase your risk of getting stomach cancer.\nYou're more likely to develop stomach cancer if you have a close relative with the condition, such as one of your parents or a sibling (brother or sister). In such cases, it may be appropriate for your doctor to arrange genetic counselling.\nIt's not fully understood why stomach cancer seems to run in families. It may be because of shared risk factors, such as having similar diets or having an H. pylori infection, or because of certain genes you inherit from your parents.\nIn around 1 in 50 cases of stomach cancer, testing has found that people share a mutation in a gene known as E-cadherin.\nYou may be more at risk of getting the condition if you have the blood type A. Your\u00a0blood type is passed on from your parents, so this could be another way in which family history may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer.\nThere's also a condition that runs in families called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. FAP causes small growths, called polyps, to form in your digestive system, and is known to increase your risk of developing bowel cancer.\nYour risk of developing stomach cancer is increased if you've had another type of cancer, such as\u00a0cancer of the oesophagus or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer that develops in your white blood cells).\nFor men, the risk of getting stomach cancer is increased after having\u00a0prostate cancer, bladder cancer,\u00a0breast cancer\u00a0or testicular cancer. For women, the risk of developing stomach cancer increases after having\u00a0ovarian cancer, breast cancer or cervical cancer.\nHaving certain medical conditions can also increase your risk of developing stomach cancer, such as pernicious anaemia\u00a0(a vitamin B12 deficiency, which occurs when your body can't absorb it properly), and peptic stomach ulcers\u00a0(an ulcer in your stomach lining, often caused by H. pylori infection).\nIf you've had stomach surgery, or surgery to a part of your body that affects your stomach, you may be more likely to develop stomach cancer.\nThis can include surgery to remove part of your stomach (known as a partial gastrectomy), surgery to remove part of your vagus nerve (the nerve that carries information from your brain to organs such as your heart, lungs and digestive system), or surgery to repair a stomach ulcer.\nHow stomach cancer spreads\nThere are 3 ways stomach cancer can spread:\n\ndirectly \u2013\u00a0the cancer can spread from the stomach into nearby tissues and organs, such as the pancreas, colon, small intestine and peritoneum (the lining of the inside of the abdominal cavity)\nthrough\u00a0the lymphatic system \u2013 the lymphatic system is a series of glands (nodes) located throughout your body, similar to the blood circulatory system; the glands produce specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection\nthrough\u00a0the blood \u2013\u00a0which can cause the cancer to spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, most commonly the liver\n\nStomach cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic stomach cancer.\n\n\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you have stomach cancer symptoms such as indigestion, unexpected weight loss, anaemia and persistent vomiting.\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your stomach for any lumpiness or tenderness. If they think that stomach cancer may be a possibility they'll refer you to a specialist for further investigation.\nIn 2015, the\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and\u00a0symptoms of stomach cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\u00a0Find out who should be referred for further tests for suspected stomach cancer.\nHospital tests\nIf your GP thinks you may have stomach cancer, they'll refer you to a specialist for tests.\nThese may include a blood test and chest\u00a0X-ray, which will assess your overall health. A sample of your stools may also be tested for blood.\nBecause of\u00a0the potentially serious nature of stomach cancer, you should be referred to the specialist within 2 weeks. Read more about waiting times.\nAn endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a piece of equipment called an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and a video camera at the end).\nIf you need to have an endoscopy, you won't be able to eat or drink for four to eight hours before the procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and duodenum (top of the small intestine) are empty.\nYou'll be awake during the endoscopy, but may be given a sedative by injection to make you feel drowsy and relaxed. A\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0may also be sprayed onto the back of your throat, so the area is numbed.\nThe endoscope will be passed down your gullet (food pipe) and into your stomach so the specialist can look for any stomach ulcers or signs of cancer. If tissue is found that may be cancerous, a sample will be taken for testing. This procedure is known as a biopsy. The sample will be examined under a microscope in a laboratory. The results will show whether the cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) and will usually take 7 to 10 days to come back.\nThe endoscopy itself usually takes about 15 minutes, although you should allow about 2 hours in total for your visit.\nIf your specialist thinks you may have cancer in the top part of your stomach, you may have an ultrasound scan at the same time as an endoscopy. This is known as an endoscopic ultrasound and uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your stomach (this method is commonly used to view an unborn baby in the womb).\nIf you have an endoscopic ultrasound, an ultrasound probe will be attached to the end of the endoscope before it's passed down your throat. The scan will help determine the stage of any cancer in the top part of your stomach.\nAfter an endoscopy, or an endoscopic ultrasound, you won't be able to drive for several hours because of the sedative. You may also have a sore throat, although this should pass within a few days.\nA barium meal X-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an X-ray. Nowadays, however, it's less commonly used to diagnose stomach cancers.\nOrgans such as your stomach don't usually show up on an X-ray because they're made of soft tissue that isn't dense enough to stop the X-rays passing through. However, when these organs are filled with barium, it blocks the X-rays and shows up white on an X-ray screen.\nYou won't able to eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the procedure because your stomach and duodenum need to be empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system.\nA barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes. Afterwards, you'll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. You may feel slightly sick, and the barium may cause constipation. Your stools may be white for a few days afterwards as the barium passes through your system.\nFurther testing\nIf you're diagnosed with stomach cancer, further tests may be needed to help determine how far it's spread and how quickly it's likely to spread (known as the stage and grade). Your cancer specialist (oncologist) will discuss this with you.\nHowever, it may not always be possible to identify the exact stage of your condition until your treatment starts.\nYour specialist may need to examine your stomach in more detail to see if the cancer has spread, particularly to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). If it has, you may need to have a small operation called a laparoscopy. This procedure is carried out under a general anaesthetic, so you'll be unconscious during it.\nDuring the procedure, a thin viewing tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) will be inserted into your stomach through a small incision in the lower part of your tummy. In some cases, your specialist may need to examine more than one area of your stomach and make more than one incision.\nDuring CT scans or PET scans, a series of X-ray images of your body are taken. A computer is then used to put the images together and create a detailed picture of the inside of your body.\nThese scans will help your doctor assess how advanced your cancer is. It allows them to see whether the cancerous cells have formed tumours anywhere else in the body. The scans can also\u00a0help your doctors work out which type of treatment will be most effective and appropriate for you.\nIf your specialist thinks your stomach cancer may have spread to your liver, you may need to have a liver ultrasound. This type of scan uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your liver.\nStaging and grading\nAfter all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell what stage and grade of stomach cancer you have.\nStaging is a measurement of how far cancer has spread. There are a number of different ways stomach cancer can be staged.\u00a0One method uses a numbering system from 1 to 4. The higher the number, the further the cancer has spread.\nThe majority of stomach cancers are at stage 3 or 4 when diagnosed, which means a cure isn't\u00a0usually possible.\nGrading describes how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. There are 3 grades of stomach cancer:\n\nlow-grade \u2013 the cancer tends to grow slowly\nmedium-grade \u2013 the cancer grows a bit\u00a0faster\nhigh-grade \u2013 the cancer is aggressive and likely to grow quickly\n\nCancer Research UK has more information about the staging and grading of stomach cancer.\n\n\nThe treatments recommended for stomach cancer will depend on your general health and how far the cancer has spread.\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams made up of a number of different specialists (see below) who work together to plan and carry out\u00a0the best treatment, tailored to your circumstances.\nFeel free to discuss treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions.\nYour treatment plan\nThe main treatments for stomach cancer are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. You may have 1 of these treatments or a combination.\nIf surgery is recommended, you may have chemotherapy beforehand. If the tumour is in the upper part of your stomach, including the junction between the oesophagus and stomach, you may also have radiotherapy prior to surgery.\nSurgery is mainly used if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy tend to be used when the condition is diagnosed at a later stage.\nWhere possible, the primary aim of treatment is to completely\u00a0remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.\u00a0It's estimated that a cure is possible in 20 to 30% of stomach cancer cases.\nIf it's not possible to remove the tumour, your doctors will focus on trying to prevent it from getting any bigger and causing further harm to your body. This may be done using surgery or chemotherapy.\u00a0\nIn some cases, it's not possible to eliminate the cancer or slow it down. In this case, your treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible, usually with surgery or radiotherapy.\nA relatively new medication called\u00a0trastuzumab (see below) can also be used to treat some types of advanced stomach cancer.\nYour healthcare team will talk to you about which treatments are most suitable.\nSurgery\nIf you're diagnosed with stomach cancer at an early stage,\u00a0it may be possible for the cancer to be completely removed during surgery.\nIn some cases, it may be possible to pass a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your oesophagus (gullet),\u00a0rather than making incisions in your tummy. This is known as endoscopic surgery, and can be used to\u00a0remove a sample of the tumour for testing (biopsy). It can also be used to remove the tumour completely if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage.\nHowever, if your cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it completely. If this is the case, you may still have surgery to remove any cancer blocking your stomach, to ease your symptoms. This will depend on whether your symptoms can be controlled and the risks and side effects of undertaking major surgery.\nAny type of surgery for stomach cancer will involve a large operation and a long recovery time. If you have stomach cancer surgery, you'll usually need to stay in hospital for around 2 weeks. You'll also need several weeks at home to recover.\nYou may\u00a0need to have part or all of your stomach removed.\nSurgery to remove part of your stomach is known as a partial or sub-total gastrectomy, and surgery to remove all of your stomach is known as a total gastrectomy. In some cases, your surgeon may remove part of your oesophagus as well as all of\u00a0your stomach, using\u00a0a procedure known as an oesophagogastrectomy.\nThese operations may be carried out\u00a0using either a large incision in your tummy (open surgery), or a number of smaller incisions through which surgical tools can be passed (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery). Both of these techniques are carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious throughout the procedure.\nDuring these operations, your surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) nearest to the cancer. It's possible that your stomach cancer may have spread to these lymph nodes, and removing them helps prevent the cancer returning.\nIf your cancer is in the lower part of your stomach, you may have a partial gastrectomy\u00a0to\u00a0remove it.\nAfter surgery, your stomach will be smaller than it was before the operation. However, the top part of your stomach, where your oesophagus feeds into it, won't be affected.\nIf your cancer is in the middle or at the top of your stomach, you may need to have a total gastrectomy. If the cancer is close to the end of your oesophagus, where it meets your stomach, you may\u00a0need to have an oesophagogastrectomy.\nIf you have a total gastrectomy, the end of your gullet will be joined to the top of your jejunum (the top part of your small intestine). If you have an oesophagogastrectomy, the remaining part of your gullet will be joined to your jejunum.\nIf your stomach cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it using surgery.\nHowever, if your stomach has been significantly affected by cancer it can cause a blockage, which prevents food from being properly digested. A blocked stomach can cause symptoms such as stomach pain, vomiting and feeling very full after eating.\nIf your stomach is blocked, there are a few options:\u00a0\n\nstenting \u2013 a stent is a plastic or wire mesh tube inserted through the oesophagus using an endoscope under local anaesthetic; after being inserted, the stent will be expanded and open up the stomach\u00a0\npartial or total gastrectomy \u2013 to remove the blockage and improve your symptoms\nbypass surgery \u2013 an operation where part of your stomach above the blockage is joined to your\u00a0small intestine, leaving the blocked part of your stomach out of your digestive system\n\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is a specialist treatment for cancer that uses medicines, called cytotoxic medicines,\u00a0to stop cancer cells dividing and multiplying. As it circulates through your body, the medicine can target cancer cells in your stomach and any that may have spread to other parts of your body.\nYou may have chemotherapy for stomach cancer before surgery to reduce the amount of cancer that has to be removed during the operation. Chemotherapy can also be used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back.\nChemotherapy can also help to slow the progression of cancer and ease the symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer, which may not be suitable for surgery.\nIf may be given orally (as tablets) or intravenously (by injection or a drip through a vein directly into your bloodstream), or a combination of both.\nIntravenous chemotherapy is usually given in hospital, while oral chemotherapy is taken at home. Chemotherapy is often given in cycles, each usually lasting about three weeks.\nAlternatively, chemotherapy may be administered through a small pump, which gives you a constant low dose over a few weeks or months. The pumps are portable and can be worn at home, which means fewer trips to hospital.\nChemotherapy works by preventing cancerous cells from growing rapidly. However, it also destroys non-cancerous cells such as\u00a0hair follicles and red and white blood cells. Side effects may include:\n\ntiredness\nnausea and vomiting\nnerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)\nhair loss\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nanaemia (a lack of red blood cells)\nweight loss\nskin changes \u2013 such as redness, swelling and a tingling sensation in the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet\n\nThe side effects you experience after having chemotherapy will depend on the type of chemotherapy and the number of treatment sessions you need. You'll be told who to contact if you're experiencing serious side effects from chemotherapy, and it's very important that this contact information is recorded carefully.\nIf you experience nausea and vomiting as a result of chemotherapy, you may be able to take anti-sickness medication to counter it. This may be given intravenously (by injection directly into your bloodstream) at the same time as your chemotherapy.\nThe side effects of chemotherapy will only last for as long as your course of treatment lasts. Once your treatment is over, the\u00a0hair follicles\u00a0and blood cells\u00a0will repair themselves. This means your hair will grow back, although it might look or feel different from how it did before chemotherapy (for example, it may be a slightly different colour, or be softer or curlier than before).\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy uses beams of high energy\u00a0radiation to destroy cancer cells. It's not often used to treat stomach cancer because there's a risk that other organs close to your stomach might be damaged by the treatment.\nHowever, if you have advanced stomach cancer that's causing pain or bleeding,\u00a0you may need to have radiotherapy. In some cases, following surgery, you may have chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to help prevent the stomach cancer from recurring.\nIf a cancer is bleeding slowly and causing anaemia, a single fraction of radiotherapy can be used to try to prevent further bleeding.\nIf you need radiotherapy, your treatment will usually begin 2 or 3 months after surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. This is a painless procedure where you lie under a radiotherapy machine while it directs radiation at your stomach. You'll be positioned by a radiographer (a specialist in radiotherapy) so that the machine targets the cancer cells and avoids as much healthy tissue as possible.\nRadiotherapy often involves having treatment sessions 5 days a week. Each session will only last a few minutes. The radiation doesn't stay in your system afterwards, and it's perfectly safe to be around others between your treatments.\nHow long you'll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on how it's used. Radiotherapy used after surgery to help prevent stomach cancer coming back usually lasts 5 weeks. If it's being used to control symptoms of advanced stomach cancer, it may only last 1 or 2 weeks.\nYou may experience the following side effects after having radiotherapy:\n\ntiredness\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\nirritation and darkening of your skin where the treatment takes place\n\nThese side effects will usually improve within a few weeks of treatment finishing.\nTrastuzumab\nTrastuzumab\u00a0(sold under the brand name Herceptin) is a medication\u00a0used to treat\u00a0breast cancer and some cases of advanced stomach cancer.\nSome stomach cancers are stimulated by a type of protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab works by blocking the effects of this protein. This doesn't cure stomach cancer, but\u00a0it can slow its growth and increase survival time.\nIf you're diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and tests show high levels of the HER2 protein in the cancerous cells, your doctors may recommend treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab.\nTrastuzumab is given intravenously, through a drip, and you'll have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to 1 hour and you'll usually need a session once every 3 weeks.\nTrastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. Therefore, it may not be suitable if you have a heart problem such as angina, uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you'll also need regular tests on your heart to check for any problems.\nOther side effects of trastuzumab may include:\n\nan initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\naches and pains\n\n\n\nBeing diagnosed with cancer is a tough challenge for most people, but support is available to help you cope.\nYou may find the following\u00a0advice helpful:\n\nkeep talking to your friends and family -\u00a0they can be a powerful support system\ntalk to others in the same situation\nresearch your condition\nset reasonable goals\ntake time out for yourself\n\nCancer charities, such as Macmillan Cancer Support, are a good source of information and support.\nGetting back to normal after surgery can take time. It's important to take things slowly and give yourself time to recover. During your recovery,\u00a0avoid lifting heavy things such as children or shopping bags, and strenuous tasks such as housework. You may also be advised not to drive.\nSome other treatments, particularly\u00a0chemotherapy and\u00a0radiotherapy, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don't be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends.\nAfter your treatment has finished, you'll be invited for regular check-ups, usually every three months for the first year. During the check-up, your doctor will examine you and may arrange blood tests or scans to see how you're responding to treatment.\nIf you've had an operation to remove part of your stomach (partial gastrectomy), you'll only be able to eat small amounts of food for a while after your operation. This is because your stomach won't be able to hold as much food as it could before the surgery, and your body will need to adjust to its new stomach capacity. You should gradually be able to increase the amount you eat as your stomach begins to expand.\nIf you've had surgery to remove all of your stomach (total gastrectomy), it may be some time before you can eat normally again. As with a partial gastrectomy, you'll only be able to eat small amounts of food until your body adjusts. You may have to eat little and often, and make changes to the types of food you eat. Your care team will be able to advise you about what and when you should eat.\nHaving surgery to remove your stomach also means you'll need to have regular injections of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is usually absorbed through your stomach from the food you eat and is needed to help prevent\u00a0a condition called anaemia and nerve problems.\nEat regularly and healthily. You may not have time to sit down for every meal, but you should make time to do so at least once a day.\nIt's understandable if there are times when you feel resentful, and then guilty for feeling so. You may also feel exhausted, isolated and worry about the person you care for.\u00a0Remember: you're human, and those feelings are natural.\nIf your stomach cancer can't be cured, your GP will give you support and any necessary pain relief (often alongside chemotherapy or radiotherapy, which can be used to reduce your symptoms).\u00a0This is called palliative care.\u00a0Support is also available for your family and friends.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Stomach ulcers (gastric ulcers)\u00a0are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. Ulcers can also occur in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach. These are called duodenal ulcers.\nStomach and duodenal ulcers are sometimes called peptic ulcers. This information applies to both.\nSymptoms of stomach ulcers\nAlthough the most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). Not all stomach ulcers are painful.\nSome people experience:\n\nindigestion\nheartburn\nnausea (feeling sick)\n\nYou should speak to your GP if you think you have a stomach ulcer.\nMore about the symptoms of a stomach ulcer\nSpeak to your GP immediately (or phone the 111 service) if:\n\nyour symptoms persist\nyou're vomiting blood \u2013 the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds\nyou're passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools\nyou feel a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse\n\nThese could be a sign of a serious complication.\nWhat causes stomach ulcers?\nStomach ulcers occur when the layer protecting the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down. This allows the stomach lining to become damaged.\nThis is usually caused by:\n\nan infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria\ntaking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin \u2013 particularly if they're taken for a long time or at high doses\n\nThere's little evidence that stress or certain foods causes stomach ulcers.\nMore about the causes of stomach ulcers\nTreating stomach ulcers\nYou'll be treated using antibiotics if your ulcer was caused by a H. pylori infection. This kills the bacteria and should prevent the ulcer coming back.\nYou'll be treated using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) if your ulcer was caused by NSAIDs. Your doctor will prescribe these and discuss whether you should keep using NSAIDs. Alternative medication to NSAIDs, such as paracetamol, may be recommended.\nMost stomach ulcers take a few months to heal after treatment. However, stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed.\nMore about treating stomach ulcers\nComplications\nComplications are rare but can be very serious and potentially life-threatening.\nThe main complications include:\n\nbleeding at the site of the ulcer\nthe stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splits open \u2013 known as perforation\nthe ulcer blocks the movement of food through the digestive system \u2013 known as gastric obstruction\n\nMore about the complications of stomach ulcers\n\n\nThe most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain that develops in your abdomen (tummy).\nHowever, some stomach ulcers aren't painful and are only noticed when a complication develops, such as bleeding from the ulcer.\nTummy pain\nThe pain caused by a stomach ulcer can either travel:\n\nout from the middle of your tummy up to your neck\ndown to your belly button\nthrough to your back\n\nAnd:\n\ncan last from a few minutes to a few hours\noften starts within a few hours of eating\ncan cause you to wake up during the night\n\nTaking antacids (indigestion medication) may temporarily relieve the pain, but it will keep coming back if the ulcer isn't treated.\nLess common symptoms\nLess common symptoms of a stomach ulcer include:\n\nindigestion\nheartburn\nloss of appetite\nfeeling and being sick\nweight loss\n\nSome people also find they burp or become bloated after eating fatty foods.\n\n\nStomach ulcers are usually caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nThese can break down the stomach's defence against the acid it produces to digest food. The stomach lining then becomes damaged causing an ulcer to form.\nH. pylori bacteria\nH. pylori bacteria live in the stomach lining. The bacteria can irritate the stomach lining and make it more vulnerable to damage from stomach acid.\nInfections are common. It's possible to be infected without realising it because the infection doesn't usually cause symptoms.\nPeople of all ages can be infected. It's not clear exactly why some people are more vulnerable to the effects of H. pylori bacteria than others.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nNSAIDs are medicines widely used to treat pain, a high temperature (fever) and inflammation (swelling).\nCommonly used NSAIDs include:\n\nibuprofen\naspirin\nnaproxen\ndiclofenac\n\nMany people take NSAIDs without having any side effects. But there's always a risk the medication could cause problems, such as stomach ulcers, particularly if taken for a long time or at high doses.\nYou may be advised not to use NSAIDs if you currently have a stomach ulcer or if you've had one in the past. Paracetamol is a safer painkiller to use.\nMore about\u00a0NSAIDs\nLifestyle factors\nThere's little evidence that stomach ulcers are caused by:\n\nspicy foods\nstress\nalcohol\n\nBut these can make the symptoms worse.\nHowever, smoking can:\n\nincrease your risk of developing stomach ulcers\nmake treatment less effective\n\n\n\nIf your GP thinks you have an ulcer, they\n\nwill want to know if you're taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nmight test you for an Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection\n\nIn some cases, you may be referred for a gastroscopy to look for an ulcer inside your stomach.\nTesting for H. pylori infection\nIf your GP thinks your symptoms might be caused by an H. pylori infection, you'll be offered a:\n\nurea breath test\nstool antigen test \u2013 a small stool sample is tested for the bacteria\nblood test\n\nYou'll be given a special drink containing a chemical that's broken down by H. pylori. Your breath is then analysed to see whether or not you have an H. pylori infection.\nA sample of your blood's tested for antibodies to the H. pylori bacteria. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally in your blood to help fight infection.\nThis test's now largely been replaced by the stool antigen test\nMore about blood tests\nGastroscopy\nA gastroscopy is a procedure that involves passing a thin, flexible tube (an endoscope) with a camera at one end into your mouth and down into your stomach and first section of the small intestine (duodenum).\nYou may:\n\nbe given a mild sedative injection before the procedure\nhave your throat sprayed with a local anaesthetic to make it more comfortable to pass the endoscope\n\nThe images taken by the camera will usually confirm or rule out an ulcer. A small tissue sample may also be taken from your stomach or duodenum to test for the H. pylori bacteria.\nYou'll have this procedure as an outpatient in hospital. This means you won't have to spend the night.\nYou may have a repeat gastroscopy after 4 to 6 weeks to check that the ulcer's healed.\n\n\nIf you have a stomach ulcer, your treatment will depend on what caused it.\nWith treatment, most ulcers heal in a month or two.\nTreating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection\nIf your stomach ulcer's caused by a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection, you'll be given:\n\na course of antibiotics\na medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)\n\nThis is also recommended if it's thought your stomach ulcer's caused by a combination of an H. pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nIf you have an H. pylori infection, you'll usually be prescribed a course of 2 or 3 antibiotics.\nThe most commonly used antibiotics are:\n\namoxicillin\nclarithromycin\nmetronidazole\n\nYou should take these twice a day for a week.\nThe side effects of these are usually mild, but can include:\n\nfeeling and being sick\ndiarrhoea\na metallic taste in your mouth\n\nYou'll be re-tested at least 4 weeks after finishing your antibiotic course to see if there are any H. pylori bacteria left in your stomach. If there are, a further course of eradication therapy using different antibiotics may be given.\nUlcers caused by NSAIDs\nIf your stomach ulcer's caused by taking NSAIDs:\n\nyou'll be given a course of PPI medication\nyour use of NSAIDs will be reviewed, and you may be advised to use an alternative painkiller\n\nYou may be advised to use an alternative painkiller not associated with stomach ulcers, such as paracetamol.\nCOX-2 inhibitors\u00a0are sometimes recommended. These are an alternative type of NSAID that's less likely to cause stomach ulcers.\nIf you're taking low-dose aspirin to reduce your risk of blood clots, your GP will tell you whether you need to keep taking it.\nIf you do, you may also be prescribed long-term treatment with a PPI or H2-receptor antagonist to prevent further ulcers.\nIt's important to understand the potential risks associated with continued NSAID use.\nYou're more likely to develop another stomach ulcer and could experience a serious complication, such as internal bleeding.\nRead more about the complications of stomach ulcers\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs)\nPPIs work by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces. This prevents further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally.\nThe most commonly used PPIs are:\n\nomeprazole\npantoprazole\nlansoprazole\n\nThey're usually prescribed for 4 to 8 weeks.\nSide effects of these are usually mild, but can include:\n\nheadaches\ndiarrhoea or constipation\nfeeling sick\nabdominal (tummy) pain\ndizziness\nrashes\n\nThese should pass once treatment has been completed.\nH2-receptor antagonists\nSometimes a type of medication called H2-receptor antagonists are used instead of PPIs.\nThese also reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces.\nRanitidine is the most widely used H2-receptor antagonist for treating stomach ulcers.\nSide effects are uncommon, but can include:\n\ndiarrhoea\nheadaches\ndizziness\nrashes\ntiredness\n\nAntacids and alginates\nAs these treatments can take several hours before they start to work, your GP may recommend taking additional antacid medication.\nAntacids:\n\nneutralise your stomach acid\nprovide immediate, but short-term, symptom relief\nshould be taken when you experience symptoms or when you expect them, such as after meals or at bedtime\n\nSome antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate, which produces a protective coating on the lining of your stomach. Antacids containing alginates are best taken after meals.\nYou can buy these medications at pharmacies. Your pharmacist can tell you which is most suitable for you.\nSide effects of both medications are usually mild, but can include:\n\ndiarrhoea or constipation\nwind (flatulence)\nstomach cramps\nfeeling and being sick\n\nLifestyle changes\nThere aren't any special lifestyle measures you need to take during treatment.\nHowever, avoiding stress, alcohol, spicy foods and smoking may reduce your symptoms while your ulcer heals.\n\n\nComplications of stomach ulcers are rare, but can be very serious.\nThe main complications are:\n\ninternal bleeding\nperforation - the lining of the stomach splits open\ngastric outlet obstruction - the stomach ulcer obstructs the normal passage of food through your digestive system\n\nInternal bleeding\nInternal bleeding's the most common complication of stomach ulcers. It can occur when an ulcer develops at the site of a blood vessel.\nThe bleeding can either be slow and long-term, or rapid and severe.\nSlow, long-term bleeding can lead to anaemia.\nSymptoms of anaemia include:\n\nfatigue\nbreathlessness\npale skin\nheart palpitations (noticeable heartbeats)\n\nYou should visit your GP if you have persistent symptoms of anaemia. If they think you have a stomach ulcer, they may refer you to a gastroenterologist for an examination and treatment.\nMore about anaemia\nContact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service immediately if you have symptoms of more severe bleeding, including:\n\nyou're vomiting blood \u2013 the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds\nyou're passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools\n\nAn endoscopy will be used to identify the cause of the bleeding. Treatment can be given during the endoscopy to stop the bleeding.\nSometimes:\n\nspecialised procedures carried out under X-ray\u00a0guidance are used to stop bleeding ulcers\nsurgery is needed to repair the affected blood vessel\n\nBlood transfusions\u00a0may also be needed to replace the blood you've lost.\nPerforation\nPerforations are a rarer complication of stomach ulcers. This is when the lining of the stomach splits open.\nThis can be very serious because it lets the bacteria that live in your stomach escape and infect the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum). This is known as peritonitis.\nIn peritonitis, an infection can rapidly spread into the blood (sepsis) before spreading to other organs. This carries the risk of multiple organ failure\u00a0and can be fatal if left untreated.\nThe most common symptom of peritonitis is sudden abdominal pain, which gets steadily worse. If you have this type of pain, contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service immediately\nPeritonitis is a medical emergency that requires hospital admission. In some cases, surgery may be needed.\nGastric outlet obstruction\nIn some cases, an inflamed (swollen) or scarred stomach ulcer can obstruct the normal passage of food through your digestive system. This is called a gastric outlet obstruction.\nSymptoms include:\n\nvomiting large amounts of undigested food\na constant feeling of bloating or fullness\nfeeling more full than usual after eating less food\nunexplained weight loss\n\nAn endoscopy can be used to confirm the obstruction.\nIf the obstruction's caused by inflammation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2-receptor antagonists can be used to reduce stomach acid levels until the swelling goes down.\nIf the obstruction's caused by scar tissue, surgery may be needed. This can involve passing a small balloon through an endoscope and inflating it to widen the site of the obstruction.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Cancer of the testicle is one of the less common cancers. It tends to mostly affect men and anyone with testicles between 15 and 49 years of age.\nThe most common symptom is a painless lump or swelling in one of the testicles.

Although it's relatively uncommon overall, testicular cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect men and anyone with testicles between the ages of 15 and 49.\nFor reasons that are unclear,\u00a0white men and anyone with testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer compared with other ethnic groups.\nThe number of cases of testicular cancer that are diagnosed each year in the UK has roughly doubled since the mid-1970s. Again, the reasons for this are unclear.\nCauses of testicular cancer\nThe exact cause or causes of testicular cancer are unknown, but a number of factors have been identified that increase a man's risk of developing it. The 3 main risk factors are described below.\nUndescended testicles\u00a0(cryptorchidism) is the most significant risk factor for testicular cancer.\nAbout 3\u00a0to 5% of boys are born with their testicles inside their abdomen. They usually descend into the scrotum during the first year of life, but in some boys the testicles don't descend.\u00a0\nIn most cases, testicles\u00a0that don't descend by the time a boy is 1 year old descend\u00a0at a later stage. If the testicles don't descend naturally,\u00a0an operation known as an\u00a0orchidopexy can be carried out to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum.\nIt's important that undescended testicles move down into the scrotum during early childhood because boys with undescended testicles have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer than boys\u00a0whose testicles descend normally. It's also much easier to observe the testicles when they're in the scrotum.\nPeople with undescended testicles are about 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer than those whose testicles descend at birth or shortly after.\nHaving a close relative with a history of testicular cancer or an undescended testicle increases your risk of also developing it.\nFor example, if your father had testicular cancer, you're around 4 times more likely to develop\u00a0it than someone with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you're about 8 times more likely to develop it.\nA number of genes may be involved\u00a0in the development of testicular cancer\u00a0in families where more than 1 person has had the condition. This is an ongoing area of research\u00a0in which patients and their families may be asked to take part.\nPeople who've previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are between 4 to 12 times more likely to develop it in the other testicle.\nFor this reason,\u00a0if you've previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer, it's very important that you keep a close eye on the other testicle.\nIf you've been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you also need to be observed for signs of recurrence for between 5 and 10 years, so it's very important that you attend your follow-up appointments.\nCancer Research UK has more information about testicular cancer risks and causes.\nOutlook\nTesticular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer, and the outlook is one of the best for cancers.\nCancer Research UK has more information about survival rates for testicular cancer.\nAlmost all men and anyone with testicles who are treated for testicular germ cell tumours are cured, and it's rare for the condition to return more than 5 years later.\nTreatment almost always includes the surgical removal of the affected testicle \u2013 called orchidectomy or orchiectomy \u2013 which doesn't usually affect fertility or the ability to have sex.\nIn some cases,\u00a0chemotherapy or, less commonly,\u00a0radiotherapy may be used for seminomas (but not non-seminomas).\nRead more about treating testicular cancer.\n\n\nThe most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in 1 of your testicles.\nThe lump or swelling can be about the size of a pea, but may be larger.\nMost lumps or swellings in the scrotum aren't in the testicle and aren't a sign of cancer. But they should never be ignored. Visit your GP as soon as you notice a lump or swelling in your scrotum.\nAssociated symptoms\nTesticular cancer can also cause other symptoms, including a:\n\ndull ache or sharp pain in your testicles or scrotum, which may come and go\nfeeling of heaviness in your scrotum\nchange in the texture or increase in firmness of a testicle\ndifference between one testicle and the other\n\nWhen to speak to your GP\nSpeak to your GP as soon as you notice any lump or swelling on your testicle. They'll examine your testicles to help determine whether or not the lump is cancerous.\nLumps within the scrotum can have many different causes and testicular cancer is rare. If your GP thinks the lump is in your testicle they may consider cancer as a possible cause.\nResearch has shown that less than 4% of scrotal lumps or swellings are cancerous. For example,\u00a0varicoceles (swollen blood vessels) and epididymal cysts (cysts in the tubes around the testicle) are common causes of testicular lumps.\nIf you do have testicular cancer, the sooner treatment begins, the greater the likelihood that you'll be completely cured.\nIf you don't feel comfortable visiting your GP, you can go to your local sexual health clinic, where a healthcare professional will be able to examine you.\nMetastatic cancer\nIf testicular cancer has spread to other parts of your body, you may also experience other symptoms. Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is known as metastatic cancer.\nAround 5% of people with testicular cancer will experience symptoms of metastatic cancer.\nThe most common place for testicular cancer to spread to is nearby lymph nodes in your abdomen or lungs. Lymph nodes are glands that make up your immune system. Less commonly, the cancer can spread to your liver, brain or bones.\nSymptoms of metastatic testicular cancer can include:\n\na persistent cough \ncoughing or spitting up blood\u00a0\nshortness of breath\u00a0\nswelling and enlargement of male breasts\na\u00a0lump or swelling in your neck\nlower\u00a0back pain\n\n\n\nSpeak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice a lump or other abnormality in your scrotum that you think may be on one of your testicles.\nMost scrotal lumps aren't cancerous, but if you have a lump that you think may be in one of your testicles it's important you have it checked as soon as possible. Treatment for testicular cancer is much more effective when started\u00a0early.\nPhysical examination\nAs well as asking you about your symptoms and looking at your medical history, your GP will usually need to examine your testicles.\nThey may hold a small light or torch against your scrotum to see whether light passes through it. Testicular lumps tend to be solid, which means light is unable to pass through them. A collection of fluid in the scrotum will allow light to pass through it.\nTests for testicular cancer\nIf you have a non-painful lump, or a change in shape or texture of one\u00a0of your testicles, and your\u00a0GP thinks it may be cancerous, you'll be referred for further testing within 2 weeks.\nA scrotal\u00a0ultrasound scan is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your testicle. It's one of the main ways of finding out whether or not a lump is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).\nDuring a scrotal ultrasound, your specialist will be able to determine the position and size of the abnormality in your testicle.\nIt will also give a clear indication of whether the lump is in the testicle or separate within the scrotum, and whether it's solid or filled with fluid. A fluid-filled lump or collection around the testis\u00a0is usually harmless. A more solid lump may be a sign the swelling is cancerous.\nTo help confirm a diagnosis, you may need a series of\u00a0blood tests to detect certain hormones in your blood, known as 'markers'.\nTesticular cancer often produces these markers, so if they're in your blood it\u00a0may indicate you have the condition.\nMarkers in your blood that will be tested for include:\n\nAFP (alpha feta protein)\nHCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin)\n\nA third blood test is also often carried out as it may indicate how active a cancer is. It's called\u00a0LDH (lactate dehydrogenate), but it isn't a specific marker for\u00a0testicular cancer.\nNot all people with testicular cancer produce markers. There may still be a chance you have testicular cancer even if your blood test results come back normal.\nThe only way to definitively confirm testicular cancer is to examine part of the lump under a microscope. These tests and reports are called histology.\nUnlike many cancers where a small piece of the cancer can be removed (a biopsy), in most cases the only way to examine a testicular lump is by removing the\u00a0affected testicle completely.\nThis is because the combination of the ultrasound and blood marker tests is usually sufficient to make\u00a0a firm diagnosis. Also, a biopsy may injure the testicle and spread cancer into the scrotum which isn't usually affected.\nYour specialist will only recommend removing your testicle if they're relatively certain the lump is cancerous. Losing a testicle won't affect your sex life or ability to have children.\nThe removal of a testicle is called an orchidectomy. It's the main type of treatment for testicular cancer, so if you have testicular cancer it's likely you'll need to have an orchidectomy.\nIn almost all cases, you'll need further tests to check whether testicular cancer has spread. When cancer of the testicle spreads, it most commonly affects the lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen or the lungs.\nTherefore, you may require a chest\u00a0X-ray\u00a0to check for\u00a0signs of a tumour. You'll also need a scan of your entire body. This is usually a\u00a0CT scan\u00a0(computerised X-ray) to check for signs of the cancer spreading. In some cases, a different type of scan, known as a\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may be used.\nStages of testicular cancer\nAfter all tests have been completed, it's usually possible to determine the stage of\u00a0your cancer.\nThere are 2 ways that testicular cancer can be staged. The first is known as the TNM staging system:\n\nT \u2013 indicates the size of the tumour\nN \u2013 indicates whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes\nM \u2013 indicates whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)\n\nTesticular cancer is also staged numerically. The 4 main stages are:\n\nstage 1 \u2013 the cancer is contained within your testicle and epididymis (the tube at the back of the testicle)\nstage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread from the testicles into the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) at the back of the abdomen\nstage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or in the neck\u00a0\nstage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread to the lungs or, rarely, to other tissues or\u00a0organs, such as the liver, bones or brain\n\nCancer Research UK has more information about testicular cancer stages.\n\n\nChemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the 3 main treatments for testicular cancer.\nYour recommended treatment plan will depend on:\n\nthe type of testicular cancer\u00a0you have\u00a0\u2013 whether it's a\u00a0seminoma or a non-seminoma\nthe stage\u00a0of your testicular cancer\n\nThe first treatment option for all cases of testicular cancer, whatever the stage, is to surgically remove the affected testicle (an orchidectomy).\nFor stage 1 seminomas, after the testicle has been removed, a single dose of chemotherapy\u00a0may be given to help prevent the cancer returning. A short course of radiotherapy is also sometimes recommended.\nHowever, in many cases, the chance of recurrence is low and your doctors may recommend that you're very carefully monitored over the next few years. Further treatment is usually only needed for the small number of people who have a recurrence.\nFor\u00a0stage 1 non-seminomas, close follow-up (called surveillance) may also be recommended, or a short course of chemotherapy using a combination of different medications.\nFor stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancers, 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy are given using a combination of different medications. Further surgery is sometimes needed after chemotherapy to remove any affected lymph nodes or deposits in the lungs or, rarely, in the liver.\nSome people with stage 2 seminomas may be suitable for less intense treatment with radiotherapy, sometimes with the addition of a simpler form of\u00a0chemotherapy.\nIn non-seminoma germ cell tumours, additional surgery may also be required after chemotherapy to remove tumours from other parts of the body, depending on the extent of the spread of the tumour.\nDeciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore discussing your treatment options with your\u00a0specialist,\u00a0you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask them. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nOrchidectomy\nAn orchidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a testicle. If you have testicular cancer, the whole of the affected testicle will need to be removed because only removing the tumour may lead to the cancer spreading.\nBy removing the entire testicle, your chances of making a full recovery are greatly improved.\u00a0Your sex life and\u00a0ability to father children won't be affected.\nAbout\u00a01 in 50 people will get a second new testicular cancer in their remaining testicle. In such circumstances, it's\u00a0sometimes possible to only remove the part of the testicle containing the tumour. You should ask your surgeon about this if you're in this position.\nIf testicular cancer is detected in its very early stages, an orchidectomy may be the only treatment you require.\nAn orchidectomy isn't carried out through the scrotum. It's done by making an incision in your groin through which the testicle is\u00a0removed with all of the tubes and blood vessels attached to the testicle that pass through the groin into the abdomen. The operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.\u00a0\nYou can have an artificial (prosthetic) testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles isn't greatly affected. The artificial testicle is usually made of silicone (a soft type of plastic).\u00a0It probably won't be exactly like your old testicle or the one you still have. It may be slightly different in size or texture.\nAfter\u00a0an orchidectomy, it's often possible to be discharged quickly, although you may need to stay in hospital for a few days. If only 1 testicle is removed, there shouldn't be any lasting side effects.\nIf both testicles are removed (a bi-lateral orchidectomy), you'll be infertile. However, removing both testicles at the same time is very rarely required, and only 1 in every 50 cases require the other testicle to be removed at a later date.\nYou may be able to bank your sperm before having a bi-lateral orchidectomy to allow you to father children if you decide to.\nMost people are still fertile after having 1 testicle removed. However, some treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility.\nSome people with testicular cancer may have low sperm counts because of changes that occur in the testicles before the cancer develops.\nFor some treatments, such as chemotherapy, infertility may occur, but standard chemotherapies have a less than 50% chance of causing infertility if the remaining testicle is normal.\nIn people who need to have post-chemotherapy removal of lumps at the back of the abdomen, known as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), the ability to ejaculate (eject sperm from the penis) may be affected, even though the remaining testicle can still produce sperm.\nBefore your treatment begins, you may want to consider sperm banking. This is where a sample of your sperm is frozen so that it can be used at a later date to impregnate your partner during artificial insemination. Before sperm banking, you may be asked to have tests for HIV,\u00a0hepatitis B and\u00a0hepatitis C.\nIf you're having complex chemotherapy for stage 2 to 4 testicular cancer, you should always be offered sperm banking. Ask if you're concerned about your fertility.\nNot all men are suitable for sperm banking. For the technique to work, the sperm has to be of a reasonably high quality. There may also be situations where it's considered too dangerous to delay treatment for sperm banking to take place.\nMost\u00a0NHS cancer treatment centres offer a free sperm banking service. However, it's up to each area of the country to decide whether they store sperm for free or whether you have to pay.\nCancer Research UK has more information about sperm banking, including the cost of sperm storage.\nIf you still have a remaining testicle, in most cases (90%)\u00a0your body will make enough testosterone so you won't notice any difference.\nIf there are any problems with your remaining testicle, you may experience symptoms due to a lack of testosterone. These symptoms can be caused for other reasons but can include:\n\ntiredness\nweight gain\nloss of libido\u00a0(sex drive)\nreduced beard growth\nreduced ability to achieve or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)\n\nHaving both testicles removed will definitely stop you producing testosterone and you'll develop the above symptoms.\nTestosterone replacement therapy is where you're given testosterone in the form of an injection, skin patch or gel to rub into your skin. If you have injections, you'll usually need to have them every 2 to 3 months.\nAfter having testosterone replacement therapy, you'll be able to maintain an erection and your sex drive will improve.\nSide effects associated with this type of treatment are uncommon, and any side effects that you do experience will usually be mild. They may include:\n\noily skin, which can sometimes trigger the onset of acne\nbreast enlargement and swelling\na change in\u00a0normal urinary patterns, such as needing to urinate more frequently or having problems passing urine (caused by an enlarged prostate gland that puts pressure on your bladder)\n\nThere are also concerns that testosterone replacement may increase the risk of\u00a0prostate cancer and you should discuss this with your doctor.\nHowever, the risks from having testosterone replacement are usually much lower than the benefits of receiving it.\nLymph node and lung surgery\nMore advanced cases of testicular cancer may spread to your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are part of your body's immune system, which helps protect against illness and infection.\nLymph node surgery is carried out under general anaesthetic. The lymph nodes in your abdomen are the nodes most likely to need removing.\nIn some cases, the nerves near the lymph nodes can become damaged, which means that rather than ejaculating semen out of your penis during sex or masturbation, the semen instead travels back into your bladder. This is known as retrograde ejaculation.\nIf you have retrograde ejaculation, you'll still experience the sensation of having an orgasm during ejaculation, but you won't be able to father a child.\nThere are a number of ways of treating retrograde ejaculation, including the use of medicines that strengthen the muscles around the neck of the bladder to prevent the flow of semen into the bladder.\nMen and anyone with testicles who wants to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in\u00a0artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).\nThere are also a number of\u00a0newer surgical techniques that carry a lower risk of retrograde ejaculation and infertility.\u00a0\nSome people with testicular cancer have deposits of cancer in their lungs and these may also need to be removed after chemotherapy if they haven't disappeared or reduced sufficiently in size. This type of surgery is also carried out under general anaesthetic and doesn't usually significantly affect breathing in the long-term.\nA newer type of lymph node surgery, called nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), is increasingly being used because it carries a lower risk of causing retrograde ejaculation and infertility.\nIn nerve-sparing RPLND, the site of the operation is limited to a much smaller area. This means there's less chance of nerve damage occurring. The disadvantage is that the surgery is more technically demanding. Therefore, nerve-sparing RPLND is currently only available at specialist centres that employ surgeons with the required training.\nLaparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (LRPLND) is a type of 'keyhole' surgery that can be used to remove the lymph nodes. During LRPLND, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions in your abdomen.\nAn instrument called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions. An endoscope is a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and a camera at one end, enabling images of the inside of your body to be relayed to an external television monitor.\nSmall, surgical instruments are passed down the endoscope and can be used to remove the affected lymph nodes.\nThe advantage of LRPLND is that there's less post-operative pain and a quicker recovery time. Also, as with nerve-sparing RPLND, in LRPLND there's a smaller chance that nerve damage will lead to retrograde ejaculation.\nHowever, as LRPLND is a new technique, there's little available evidence regarding the procedure's long-term safety and effectiveness. If you're considering\u00a0LRPLND, you should understand there are still uncertainties about the safety and effectiveness of\u00a0the procedure.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0uses high-energy beams of radiation to help destroy cancer cells. Sometimes, seminomas may require radiotherapy after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning.\nIt may also be needed in advanced cases where someone is unable to tolerate the complex chemotherapies that are usually used to treat stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancer.\nIf testicular cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may require radiotherapy after a course of chemotherapy.\nSide effects of radiotherapy\u00a0can include:\n\nreddening and soreness of the skin, which is similar to\u00a0sunburn\nnausea\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nfatigue\n\nThese side effects are usually only temporary and should improve when your treatment is completed.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0uses powerful medicines to kill the malignant (cancerous) cells in your body or stop them multiplying.\nYou may require chemotherapy if\u00a0you have advanced testicular cancer or it's spread within your body. It's also used to help prevent the cancer returning. Chemotherapy is commonly used to treat seminomas and non-seminoma tumours.\nChemotherapy medicines for testicular cancer are usually injected into a vein. In some cases, a special tube called a central line is used, which stays in a vein throughout your treatment so that you don't have to keep having blood tests or needles placed in a new vein.\nSometimes, chemotherapy medicines can attack your body's normal, healthy cells. This is why chemotherapy can have many different side effects. The most common\u00a0include:\n\nvomiting\nhair loss\u00a0\nnausea\nsore mouth and\u00a0mouth ulcers\u00a0\nloss of appetite\nfatigue\nbreathlessness and lung damage\u00a0\ninfertility\nringing in your ears (tinnitus)\nskin that bleeds or bruises easily\nlow blood counts\u00a0\nincreased vulnerability to infection\u00a0\nnumbness and tingling (pins and needles) in your hands and feet\nkidney damage\n\nThese side effects are usually only temporary and should improve after you've completed your treatment.\nSide effects, such as infections that occur when you have a low blood count, can be life-threatening, and it's essential that you always call your cancer care team if you're worried between chemotherapy treatments.\nOne of the medicines commonly used, called bleomycin, can cause long-term lung damage and you should discuss this with your doctors if damage to your lungs would have specific issues for your career or lifestyle. However, the advice may still be that you should receive it for the best chance of a cure.\nYou shouldn't father children while having chemotherapy and for a year after your treatment has finished. This is because chemotherapy medications can temporarily damage your sperm, increasing your risk of fathering a baby with serious birth defects. Therefore, you'll need to use a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, during this time.\nCondoms should also be used during the first 48 hours after having a course of chemotherapy. This is to protect your partner from any potentially harmful effects of the chemotherapy medication in your sperm.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nFollow-up\nEven if your cancer has been completely cured, there's a risk it will return.\u00a0The risk of your cancer returning will depend on what stage it was at\u00a0when you were diagnosed and what treatment you've had since.\nMost recurrences of non-seminoma testicular cancer occur within 2 years of surgery or completion of chemotherapy. In seminomas, recurrences still occur until 3 years. Recurrences after 3 years are rare, occurring in less than 5% of people.\nBecause of the risk of recurrence, you'll need regular tests to check if the cancer has returned. These include:\n\na physical examination\nblood tests\u00a0to check for tumour markers\na chest\u00a0X-ray\na\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan\n\nFollow-up and testing is usually recommended depending\u00a0on the extent of the cancer and the treatment offered. This is usually more frequent in the first year or two but follow-up appointments may last for up to 5 years. In certain cases, it may be necessary to continue follow-up appointments for 10 years or longer.\nIf the cancer returns following treatment for stage 1 testicular cancer, and it's diagnosed at an early stage, it will usually be possible to cure it using chemotherapy and possibly also radiotherapy. Some types of recurring testicular cancer have a cure rate of over 95%.\nRecurrences that occur after previous combination chemotherapy can also be cured, but the chances of this will vary between individuals and you'll need to ask your doctors to discuss this with you.\nCancer Research UK has\u00a0more information about follow-up for testicular cancer.\n\n\nThe causes of testicular cancer are not fully understood.\nHowever, several things that increase your\u00a0risk of developing the condition.\nUndescended testicles\nUndescended testicles is the most significant risk factor.\nWhen male babies grow in the womb, their testicles develop inside their abdomen. The testicles then normally move down into the scrotum when the baby is born or during their first year of life.\nHowever, for some children, the testicles fail to descend. The medical name for\u00a0undescended testicles is cryptorchidism.\u00a0\nSurgery is usually required to move the testicles down. If you have had surgery to move your testicles down into your scrotum, your risk of developing testicular cancer may be increased.\nOf surgery is performed before the child is 13 years of age, their risk of later developing testicular cancer is approximately double that of the rest of the population. However, if the operation is carried out after the boy is 13 years of age, the risk of developing testicular cancer is 5 times greater\u00a0than that of\u00a0the rest of the population.\nPrevious testicular cancer\nMen and anyone with testicles who has previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer are 12 times more likely to develop testicular cancer in the other testicle.\nFor this reason, it's important to attend follow-up appointments if you have previously been diagnosed with testicular cancer.\nAge and race\nUnlike most other types of cancer, testicular cancer is more common in young and middle-aged men and anyone with testicles. Men and anyone with testicles aged 30\u00a0to 34 are most likely to be diagnosed with testicular cancer.\nTesticular cancer is more common in white men and anyone with testicles than other ethnic groups. It's also more common in Northern and Western Europe compared with other parts of the world.\nFamily history\nHaving a close relative with a history of testicular cancer increases your risk of developing it.\nIf your father had testicular cancer, you are 4 to 6 times more likely to develop\u00a0it than\u00a0a person with no family history of the condition. If your brother had testicular cancer, you are 8 to 10 times more likely to develop it (having an identical twin with testicular cancer means that you are 75 times more likely to develop it).\nThe fact that testicular cancer appears to run in families has led researchers to speculate that there may be one or more genetic mutations (abnormal changes to the instructions that control cell activity) that make a person more likely to develop testicular cancer.\nMutations in 2 genes (known as the KITLG and SPRY4 genes) may\u00a0increase the risk of a person developing testicular cancer.\nEndocrine disruptors\nExamples of endocrine disruptors include:\n\nsome types of pesticide\npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemical compounds used as a coolant\ndibutyl phthalate, a chemical used to manufacture cosmetics, such as nail polish\n\nIn most countries, including the UK, many endocrine disruptors, such as PCBs, have been withdrawn as a result of their link to health problems. However, there is a concern that exposure to endocrine disruptors may still occur due to contamination of the food chain.\nHowever, there is not yet enough evidence to prove a definite link between indirect exposure to low levels of endocrine disruptors and health problems. Indirect exposure is the type of exposure that would occur if the food chain was contaminated.\nInfertility\nMen and anyone with testicles who are infertile\u00a0are 3 times more likely to develop testicular cancer. The reasons for this are not clear.\nSmoking\nResearch has found that long-term smokers (people who have been smoking a pack of 20 cigarettes a day for 12 years or 10 cigarettes a day for 24 years) are twice as likely to develop testicular cancer\u00a0than non-smokers.\u00a0\nHIV and AIDS\nStudies show that men and anyone with testicles with\u00a0HIV or AIDS have an increased risk of testicular cancer.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "It can be embarrassing to talk about your testicles and any changes to them that you\u2019ve noticed. Understanding more about what they do might help.\nFacts about testicles\nTesticles are small and oval-shaped. They hang below your penis in a sac called the scrotum.\nFrom puberty, your testicles produce a hormone called testosterone. This gives you a lower voice, hair on your face and body, and makes your muscles get bigger. You also need it for your sex drive and for getting an erection.\nThe testicles make sperm from puberty (around 13\u00a0to 14 years old) onwards. When sperm meets with a female egg during sex, this can cause pregnancy.\nThe testicles make millions of sperm a day, but if sperm are not ejaculated they are reabsorbed back into your body.\nSperm wait in the epididymis next to the testicle until they are ejaculated. At ejaculation, they travel up through the spermatic cord and mix with fluid from the prostate to make semen. They go out of the body through the urethra (this is the same tube you pass urine (pee) through).\nLymph nodes (glands)\nLymph nodes are small and round, and connect to each other by tiny tubes that carry fluid called lymph. We have lymph nodes throughout our bodies. They are part of the lymphatic system, which protects us from infections.\nSometimes cancer cells from the testicle can spread to lymph nodes at the back of the abdomen (tummy). You\u2019ll have a scan to check your lymph nodes.\nWe have more information about:\n\nsigns and symptoms of testicular cancer\nhaving tests for testicular cancer\nhaving treatment for testicular cance\n\nIf you're looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer,\u00a0read\u00a0our general testicular cancer section.\n\n\nYou may have tests done by your GP or at the hospital. They will help your doctors see whether you have testicular cancer.\nVisiting your GP\nIf you think you might have some of the symptoms of testicular cancer, you should go to your GP. They'll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer they can do tests to find out more.\nIf your doctor thinks there is a chance you might have cancer, they\u2019ll examine your testicles. They might also arrange for you to have an ultrasound test. This uses sound waves to take a picture of the testicles.\nAt the hospital\nIf you need more tests you\u2019ll be referred to a hospital. This could be a general hospital or a specialist cancer hospital.\nYou'll be seen by a specialist doctor (urologist), who will examine you and do the following tests:\n\nblood tests to check for chemicals in the blood called tumour markers \u2013 some testicular cancers (but not all) produce high levels of these\nan ultrasound scan of the scrotum and testicles (if you haven\u2019t already had one) \u2013 this can usually tell the difference between a cancer and a cyst (a harmless lump filled with fluid)\n\nIf your ultrasound shows the lump is almost certainly cancer, an operation to remove a testicle (orchidectomy) is done. You\u2019ll only have this operation if it\u2019s necessary. Your specialist will explain this to you. After the operation a doctor will use a microscope to look for cancer cells in the removed testicle.\nThis may be the only operation you need. It will not stop you having sex or becoming a dad in the future. You can read more about this operation in our section on treatment for testicular cancer..\nIf testicular cancer is diagnosed you will need some other tests:\n\nmore blood tests to check how well your liver and kidneys are working, and to check your tumour markers again\nchest X-rays to check your lungs are healthy \u2013 this is sometimes done before the operation\nCT, MRI, or PET scans to find out if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes at the back of your abdomen (tummy), or to anywhere else in your body\n\nYou\u2019ll be seen by a cancer specialist and usually a specialist nurse at a cancer treatment centre to get your test results. The results will help your specialist plan the best treatment for you.\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be a scary time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse and doctor can make it a bit easier.\nIf you need any further treatment you will have it at the cancer treatment centre.\nWe have more information about:\n\nthe testicles\nsymptoms of testicular cancer\ntreatment for testicular cancer\nliving with and after testicular cancer\n\nIf you're looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section.\n\n\nTreatment for testicular cancer can be very successful. Surgery and chemotherapy are the 2 main types of treatment. Often people have both treatments.\nTo make sure you have the right treatment, your specialist needs to know what stage the cancer is. The stage of a cancer describes the tumour and whether it has spread outside the testicle. You may need some more tests to confirm what stage you are at. Waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. But this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.\nTreatment for testicular cancer can be really successful. Most young men with testicular cancer are cured, even if the cancer has spread. If you have any questions about your treatment, don't be afraid to ask your doctor or nurse.\nSurgery\nSurgery\u00a0to remove the testicle is one of the main treatments for testicular cancer. The operation is called an orchidectomy. It can be done as a day patient or during a short stay in hospital.\nYou may feel shocked and scared at the thought of having this done. Your doctor and nurse will tell you more about it so that you know what to expect.\nThe surgeon makes a small cut (incision) through your lower abdomen (tummy) in the groin on the affected side. The testicle is pushed up from the scrotum and removed through the cut.\nDuring the operation the surgeon can put a false testicle into your scrotum so that you\u2019ll look the same as before. Your surgeon will explain this to you before the operation, or you can ask them about it. If this wasn\u2019t done at the time of the operation, but now you think you would like this, talk to your doctor or nurse. It is a small operation to put this in later on.\nYou'll have a small dressing where the cut was made. This can usually be removed a day or so after the operation. The stitches in the wound will dissolve by themselves over the next few months.\nYou'll probably feel a bit sore and you\u2019ll be given painkillers to take regularly. Let your nurse or doctor know if they\u2019re not controlling the pain. Wearing fitted briefs or shorts that support you and loose trousers like jogging bottoms can feel more comfortable after your operation.\nYou\u2019ll probably feel tired and need to take things easy for about a week. You can expect to make a quick recovery after this operation.\nIf one of your testicles is removed, you will still be able to have sex and make someone pregnant. Your other testicle should produce enough of the hormone testosterone and sperm.\nIt isn't common to have both testicles removed. If you\u2019ve had this done then you\u2019ll be prescribed testosterone so you'll still be able to have sex. But you won't be making sperm now, so you won\u2019t be able to make someone pregnant through sex. Your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking before your surgery. Storing your sperm before the operation can help you to become a dad in the future. Our sections on sex and relationships and fertility have more information as well as ways of coping.\nIf after surgery the chance of the cancer coming back is very low, your doctor might suggest you have surveillance. This means having regular checks to look for signs of the cancer coming back. If it does come back and it\u2019s picked up very early, then it\u2019s easy to cure. If the cancer doesn\u2019t come back then you\u2019ve avoided having unnecessary treatment. At each clinic appointment, your doctor will examine you and you may have blood tests and chest X-rays.\nGoing to all your surveillance appointments is really important. You could put a reminder in your phone.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0is when you\u2019re given anti-cancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells.\nYou might be given chemotherapy:\n\nafter the operation to remove your testicle, to reduce the chance of the cancer coming back\nto destroy cancer cells that have already spread outside the testicle\nif the cancer comes back\noccasionally before surgery, if the cancer has spread\n\nChemotherapy can affect your fertility. Before your chemotherapy starts, your doctor will talk to you about storing some of your sperm. This is called sperm banking. We have more information about fertility issues.\nChemotherapy is given into a vein as injections or drips. You have your chemotherapy through one of the following:\n\na fine tube called a cannula\na line into a vein in the chest (called a central line)\na line into the arm (PICC line) that leads into a vein in the chest\n\nFind out more about how chemotherapy is given.\nThe amount of chemotherapy you have depends on the stage of the cancer. If the stage is low then you will have 1\u00a0to 2 cycles (sessions) of chemotherapy. If the stage is higher, or if the cancer comes back during surveillance, you\u2019ll usually have 3\u00a0to 4 cycles of chemotherapy.\nThe drugs most often used to treat testicular cancer are cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin. Giving these drugs together is called BEP.\nChemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment. A cycle usually takes 3 weeks. If you have BEP, you\u2019ll usually spend 3 to 5 days of the first week having your chemotherapy as a day patient, or you might need to stay in hospital overnight. After this you\u2019ll come back to the clinic for another injection of chemotherapy a week later, and again the following week.\nIf the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if it isn\u2019t going away completely with BEP, then different chemotherapy drugs can be given.\nDifferent chemotherapy drugs cause different side effects. You will probably have a few side effects, but it's hard to know exactly how it's going to be you. Your doctor will do everything they can to treat any side effects you have.\nMost side effects are short-term and gradually disappear once treatment stops. The most common temporary side effects are:\n\nhair loss\ntiredness\nfeeling sick or being sick (which can be controlled with medicines)\nbeing more at risk of getting an infection\n\nThere\u2019s more information in the chemotherapy section.\nSometimes side effects can be long-term. For example, although chemotherapy usually only affects fertility for a year or so, sometimes it\u2019s permanent. Read Macmillan's fertility section for more information.\nThere may be other late effects of treatment and your specialist can talk to you about this.\nIf the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy area are still swollen after chemotherapy, they\u2019re usually removed with an operation.\u00a0Lymph nodes are part of the body's immune system and help fight infection. The lymph nodes in the tummy are called the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, so the operation is called a 'retroperitoneal lymph node dissection'. The operation will be done by experienced surgeons in specialist centres.\nThe lymph nodes might contain cells that could become cancerous in the future, so having them removed is the only certain way to find this out.\nYou might be in hospital for up to 10 days. The surgeon usually makes a cut from the top of your tummy (near your breastbone) to below your belly button. This leaves you with a scar but it\u2019ll gradually fade until it ends up looking like a fine line.\nSometimes you have surgery to remove any abnormal cells in areas like the lung or the lymph nodes in the chest.\nYou\u2019ll have a drip in your arm to give you fluids until you\u2019re able to eat and drink normally. You\u2019ll also have drainage tubes from the wound to stop any extra fluid collecting. The nurses will keep a check on the dressing over your wound and change it when needed. You\u2019ll be given painkillers to take regularly. Your staples (like metal stitches) are removed 7 to 10 days after the operation.\nIt might take a few months to get back to the level of fitness you had before.\nThis operation can affect your fertility, because the nerves that control the release of sperm (ejaculation) may be damaged by surgery. Surgeons use 'nerve-sparing\u2019 techniques to try to stop this happening. The operation doesn\u2019t usually stop you getting an erection or having an orgasm.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms of testicular cance\nhaving tests for testicular cancer\nliving with and after testicular cancer\nthe testicles\n\nIf you're looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section.\n\n\nBeing diagnosed with cancer can have a big impact on your life, even after you've finished treatment.\nAfter treatment\nOnce you finish your treatment, you\u2019ll have regular follow-up appointments at the hospital. You\u2019ll have blood tests for tumour markers and sometimes other scans or X-rays. If the tumour markers go up, this can be a sign that the cancer has come back. This means you need more treatment, which can still cure the cancer.\nYou might find it embarrassing to talk about your private parts and how the cancer or cancer treatment has affected them. It can feel awkward talking to doctors or your family about this.\nTry not to let this put you off talking about things. It can be really helpful to let someone know how you're feeling, so that you don't bottle things up.\nFertility is the ability to have children. Some cancers and cancer treatments can affect a young man\u2019s fertility, but your doctors will always think about this when planning your treatment. Your doctor will talk to you about sperm banking prior to treatment if this might happen.\nIf only\u00a01\u00a0of your testicles has been removed, the one left should continue to make sperm and produce enough testosterone so that your fertility is not affected. You can still have sex.\nIf you have chemotherapy, your ability to produce sperm might be affected. After chemotherapy you can have a sample checked to see if this has happened. You can still have sex, but when you are on chemotherapy (and for a few months afterwards) you should always wear a condom to protect your partner from the chemotherapy.\nIf you had an operation to remove both of your testicles or the lymph nodes at the back of your tummy (abdomen), your fertility and your ability to have sex may be affected. This is a really tough thing to cope with on top of everything else that you\u2019re going through. Your specialist nurse will provide support and help you find more advice and support if you feel you need it. There are things which can be done to help so that you can still have sex.\nWe also have more information about:\n\nsymptoms of testicular cancer\nhaving tests for testicular cancer\ntreatment for testicular cancer\nthe testicles\n\nIf you're looking for information for all ages about testicular cancer, read our general testicular cancer section.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Lumps and swellings in the testicles are a relatively common symptom in boys, men and anyone with testicles and can have a number of different causes.\nThe vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are caused by benign (non-cancerous) conditions that may not need treatment, but it's important to know what's normal for you and to\u00a0see your GP if you notice any changes in your testicles so they can try to identify the cause.\nThere are many possible reasons why your testicles may become swollen or develop a lump.

Read more about diagnosing testicular lumps and swellings.\nSome of the main types of testicular lumps and swellings are outlined below.\nThere are a number of different benign causes of testicular lumps and swellings.\nMost of these conditions are largely harmless and may not require treatment, although you should seek immediate medical advice if you suspect you have testicular torsion (see below) because it needs to be treated quickly.\nVaricoceles are soft lumps that usually develop gradually above the testicle and mostly on the left side of the scrotum (the loose sac of skin that contains the testicles). They are sometimes described as feeling like a \"bag of worms\".\nThe exact cause of varicoceles is not clear, but it is widely thought that they occur as the result of abnormalities in the veins in the testicles leading to\u00a0a build-up of excess blood in the veins, which makes them swell.\nThe size of varicoceles can vary. Some may only be noticeable when you touch them. Others can be larger and seen easily. The side of the scrotum that contains the varicoceles may hang slightly lower than the other side.\nBesides a lump, varicoceles do not usually cause any other symptoms, although some men and anyone with testicles who have them experience a heavy feeling or aching pain in their scrotum or groin.\nIn a few cases, varicoceles have been linked to infertility. However, there is no evidence that surgically removing them improves your chances of being able to have a baby.\nHydroceles are swellings in the scrotum caused by a build-up of fluid.\nThey often affect newborn babies, usually only causing a painless swelling of one or both testicles, although they can\u00a0sometimes affect older boys, men and anyone with testicles, who may feel some discomfort in the scrotum.\nDuring pregnancy, a male baby's testicles develop inside his abdomen (tummy) and they pass down into the scrotum through a passage once they are formed. This passage usually closes before birth, but in some cases it stays open. If the passage remains open, fluid can pass from the abdomen into the scrotum, causing the swelling associated with a hydrocele.\nIn most cases affecting babies, the fluid is absorbed into the surrounding tissue during the child's first year or two of life, and the hydrocele disappears.\nHydroceles that develop in men, older boys and anyone with testicles may be caused by inflammation (swelling) of the scrotum resulting from problems such as an injury or infection.\nAn epididymal cyst is a small, smooth fluid-filled swelling that slowly develops in the\u00a0epididymis (a coil-like structure behind the testicles that helps to store and transport sperm).\nThey\u00a0are often painless, but the affected testicle may sometimes ache or feel heavy. You may also experience some pain and discomfort if the cyst puts pressure on other structures in or around your testicle.\nIt's not clear what causes\u00a0epididymal cysts, but they tend to be more common\u00a0in middle-aged men and anyone with testicles.\nEpididymo-orchitis is the inflammation of the epididymis as well as the testicle, causing the affected testicle to become swollen, painful and tender over a matter of hours or days.\nIt's not always clear what causes\u00a0epididymo-orchitis, but\u00a0the condition\u00a0is often linked to an infection, including:\n\nsexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea\nurinary tract infections (UTIs)\nmumps\n\nEpididymo-orchitis can sometimes\u00a0lead to a reduced sperm count, although this is rarely significant enough to cause infertility.\nAn\u00a0inguinal hernia occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel, such as the intestine, pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.\nThe hernia can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin, or as an enlarged scrotum.\u00a0The lump is often painless, but\u00a0it can become suddenly and severely painful if the blood supply to\u00a0the section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation).\nIf you think you have a hernia that has become strangulated, you\u00a0should visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible because urgent surgery may be required.\nInguinal hernias occur when the tissue or bowel pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (the abdominal wall) into the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is a channel through which blood vessels to the testicles pass in men and through which the round ligament (the ligament surrounding the womb) passes in women.\nInguinal hernias occur mainly in men. Most are thought to be due to ageing. This is because as you get older, the muscles surrounding your abdomen can become weaker. They\u00a0can also sometimes appear suddenly due to strain on the abdomen, such as straining on the toilet if you have constipation or carrying and pushing heavy loads.\nTesticular torsion is a benign but serious condition caused by the spermatic cord (the cord that supplies the testicles with blood) becoming severely twisted.\nUnlike the other types of benign testicular lumps and swellings, testicular torsion is a medical emergency. You should contact your GP immediately or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you suspect you have testicular torsion.\nSigns and symptoms of testicular torsion include:\n\na sudden, severe pain in one of your testicles\nswelling of the scrotum\nnausea\nvomiting\nabdominal (tummy) pain\n\nIf\u00a0the spermatic cord becomes severely twisted, the blood supply for the affected testicle can be interrupted. If this is not treated quickly with surgery, there is a risk of losing the affected testicle.\nTesticular torsion can occur at any age, but is most common in\u00a0boys aged 13\u00a0to 17 and is rare in men and anyone with testicles over 30. It can also affect newborn babies and even unborn babies in the womb.\nMost cases\u00a0happen for no apparent reason, although the problem can occur in boys who are born with an unusually loose spermatic cord and it can develop after an injury to the testicles.\nYou may also be at a higher risk of developing testicular torsion\u00a0if you have a history of undescended testicles (where a boy is born without both testicles in their scrotum).\nAlthough the vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are benign, a lump in one of the testicles can sometimes be a sign of testicular cancer.\nCancer Research UK estimates that fewer than four in every 100 testicular lumps are caused by cancer.\nLumps associated with testicular cancer tend to develop slowly on the testicle itself (as opposed to the scrotum) are usually:\n\npainless (although some people do experience pain or discomfort)\nsolid and firm\nnot tender to touch\n\nUnlike many other types of cancer, the risk of testicular cancer does not keep increasing as you get older. The condition is most often diagnosed in boys, men and anyone with testicles between the ages of 15 and 49. It's uncommon in men and anyone with testicles older than this.\nRead more about the symptoms of testicular cancer\n\n\nVisit your GP if you notice any changes in your testicles. \nMost testicular lumps are not caused by\u00a0testicular cancer\u00a0and many do not necessarily need any treatment, but it's best to get them checked out.\nYour GP will ask you whether you have:\n\nfelt any pain,\u00a0and if so, where it was, how severe it was, how\u00a0suddenly it developed\u00a0and how long it has lasted\u00a0\nany other symptoms, such as pain when you urinate or any discharge from your penis, which could be a sign of an infection\na history of trauma, such as a sports injury to your groin\u00a0\n\nThey will also want to examine your testicles to check:\n\nthe size of your testicles\u00a0\nthe position of the lump or swelling\u00a0\nwhether the lump causes any pain when it is touched\u00a0\nwhether the lump is firm or soft\n\nYour GP may hold a small light or torch against the lump in your testicle to see whether light passes through it. This can help differentiate between solid lumps and lumps caused by a build-up of fluid (such as hydroceles).\nDepending on what your GP thinks may be the cause of your symptoms, you may be referred to a specialist \u2013 such as\u00a0a urologist (a doctor specialising in conditions affecting the urinary system) \u2013 for further assessment or your GP may arrange more tests.\nIf testicular torsion is suspected, you will usually be referred to hospital for an urgent assessment to see whether an immediate operation is necessary.\nYour GP may take\u00a0a urine sample if they suspect your lump or swelling may be caused by an infection. They\u00a0may also use a swab (small cotton bud) to collect a sample of cells and fluid from your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). This sample can also be tested to see if you have an infection.\nYou may be referred to a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic if it is thought you may have a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\nAn ultrasound scan is used if there is any uncertainty about the cause of your lump or swelling. This is a painless scan that uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your scrotum.\nAn ultrasound scan can help give a clearer indication of\u00a0whether the lump is solid or filled with fluid and can help determine the likelihood of the lump being cancerous.\n\n\nTreatment for your testicular lump or swelling will depend on the underlying cause.\u00a0Some lumps may not need to be treated at all if they are not causing any problems.\nIn most cases, varicoceles do not require treatment. They usually don't cause other symptoms or long-term problems.\nAlthough varicoceles are sometimes associated with infertility, mostly fertility is not affected. There is currently not enough evidence to suggest that treating\u00a0varicoceles\u00a0will help improve your chances of having a child.\nIf you have a varicocele that is causing pain or discomfort,\u00a0taking simple\u00a0painkillers such as paracetamol and\u00a0wearing supportive underwear may help initially.\nYour GP can refer you to a urologist (a doctor specialising in conditions affecting the urinary system) who can discuss the option of surgery with you if your varicocele is still causing your problems.\nIn many cases, a technique called varicocele embolisation can be used to treat problematic varicoceles.\nA\u00a0tiny tube is inserted into a vein in your groin or neck and X-ray equipment is used to guide it to\u00a0the affected veins in your testicles. Metal coils or a special liquid are then passed through the tube to block the affected veins. The blood will then bypass the blocked veins, reducing the swelling associated with the varicocele.\nMost varicocele embolisation procedures are carried out on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. It is usually carried out under\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0(you'll be awake during the procedure but the affected area will be numbed).\u00a0\nVaricocele embolisation is a safe and effective procedure, although you may experience some swelling or bruising where the tube was inserted for a few days afterwards. There is also a small risk of infection, which can be treated with\u00a0antibiotics, and there is a possibility the varicocele could recur later on.\nSome varicoceles need surgery to directly tie off or remove the affected veins.\u00a0This is usually performed under general anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're asleep) and involves making incisions (cuts)\u00a0in your groin or abdomen.\nHydroceles in newborn babies usually disappear by the time the baby reaches two years of age. Treatment is usually only needed if they persist for longer than this, or cause pain or discomfort.\nTreatment may also be recommended in boys or adults with a hydrocele that is particularly large or is causing any other symptoms. In such cases, you can be referred to a surgeon to discuss your options.\nA\u00a0surgical procedure known as a hydrocelectomy\u00a0is often recommended for hydroceles. \u00a0\nIn children, an incision is made in the groin before sealing the passage between the abdomen (tummy) and the scrotum that allows fluid to flow into the scrotum.\u00a0In adults, the incision is made in the scrotum, the fluid is drained away and the incision is closed using dissolvable stitches.\nBoth procedures are usually carried out under general anaesthetic and most people\u00a0will be\u00a0able to return home soon after having the operation.\nYou may experience some discomfort, swelling, and fluid seepage from the wound after the procedure, but this should only last for a few days. Taking simple painkillers and wearing supportive underwear may help reduce any discomfort in the meantime.\nAs with a varicocele embolisation, there is a small risk of infection after a hydrocelectomy and\u00a0there is a possibility the hydrocele could recur.\nEpididymal cysts don't normally require treatment because they are usually harmless and don't cause other symptoms. However, if\u00a0you have a cyst that is getting bigger or is causing any pain or discomfort, you may be\u00a0referred to a urologist to discuss the possibility of surgery.\nA procedure to remove an epididymal cyst is carried out under general anaesthetic and involves removing the cysts through a small incision in your scrotum that is sealed with dissolvable stitches.\nIn some cases,\u00a0it may also be necessary to remove the epididymis (a coil-like structure behind the testicles that helps to store and transport sperm) to prevent another cyst from forming.\nAs with other procedures, you may experience some discomfort, swelling, and fluid seepage from the wound for a few days after the procedure, but this should only last for a few days.\u00a0Taking simple painkillers and wearing supportive underwear may help reduce any discomfort.\nThere is also a small risk of the wound becoming infected\u00a0and there is a chance of cysts recurring if the epididymis is not removed.\nAs\u00a0epididymo-orchitis is often thought to be caused by bacterial infections, such as\u00a0sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and\u00a0urinary tract infections (UTIs), treatment will usually involve a 10-14 day course of antibiotic tablets.\nIf your GP suspects\u00a0epididymo-orchitis has occurred as a complication of a\u00a0mumps infection, antibiotics are not used because mumps is caused by a virus.\nIn these cases, the\u00a0swelling and pain in the testicles will usually resolve within a week or two. Wearing supportive underwear, applying cold or warm compresses to your testicles and taking simple painkillers may help reduce discomfort in the meantime.\nYou may be referred to a surgeon to discuss\u00a0the option of having an operation to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall.\nThis operation\u00a0will be\u00a0carried\u00a0out urgently if there are signs that the blood supply to the tissue forming the lump has become interrupted (strangulated), because\u00a0this can cause the affected tissue\u00a0to\u00a0die.\nThere are two ways that an inguinal hernia repair can be performed:\n\nopen surgery \u2013 where one cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the abdomen\nkeyhole (laparoscopic) surgery \u2013 a less invasive but more difficult technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have will depend on which method suits you and your surgeon\u2019s experience. With both types of surgery, you should be able to go home the same day or the day after.\nAn inguinal hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks. Although it is not uncommon for a hernia to recur at some point after surgery.\nIf you have testicular torsion, you will need\u00a0surgery as soon as possible to\u00a0untwist the\u00a0testicle. Permanent injury to the testicle can occur within hours of having testicular torsion, which may affect your fertility or result in the loss of your testicle.\nSurgery for testicular torsion is carried out under general anaesthetic. The surgeon will make an incision in your scrotum before untwisting the spermatic cord (the cord that supplies the testicles with blood). The testicle (or testicles) will then be stitched to the inside of the scrotum to prevent the spermatic cord twisting again.\nThe longer you wait before having surgery, the higher the risk that your surgeon will not be able to save the trapped testicle. Research has found\u00a0that when\u00a0men have surgery within six hours of testicular torsion occurring,\u00a0nine out of 10 twisted testicles will be saved. However, if the surgery is delayed for 24 hours, only\u00a0one out of 10 twisted testicles will be saved.\nIf it is not possible to save the affected testicle, the surgeon will need to remove it and seal the spermatic cord. In these cases, another operation can be carried out at a later date to fit a replacement\u00a0artificial (prosthetic) testicle.\nIf you have been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you will be cared for by a team of clinicians, who will help decide the best treatment for you.\nThis will depend on factors such as the specific type of testicular cancer you have and how far it had spread before it was diagnosed.\nSurgery to remove the affected testicle will be recommended in most cases and this may sometimes be followed by\u00a0a course of\u00a0chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nIf you want, you can have a prosthetic testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles is not greatly affected.\nIn rare cases where it is necessary to remove both testicles, you will become infertile. However, you may be able to bank your sperm before the operation to allow you to father children in the future.\nRead more\u00a0about\u00a0treating testicular cancer\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Threadworms, also known as pinworms, are tiny parasitic worms that infect the large intestine of humans.\nThreadworms\u00a0are a common type of\u00a0worm\u00a0infection in the UK, particularly in children under the age of\u00a010.\nThe worms\u00a0are white and look like small pieces of thread.

In these circumstances, the recommended\u00a0treatment is\u00a0usually different.\nSevere or persistent threadworm infections can cause:\n\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\nskin infection around the anus if bacteria enter\u00a0any scratches caused by itching \u2013 wearing cotton gloves while sleeping may help prevent this\ndifficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep\u00a0(insomnia)\nbedwetting\n\nIn such cases, you should seek further advice from your GP. In very rare cases, threadworms can spread outside the intestine\u00a0to\u00a0the urinary tract or\u00a0liver, or the vagina or womb in girls or women.\nHow threadworms are spread\nThreadworms lay their eggs around an infected person's anus (bottom), usually at night. Along with the eggs, the worm also secretes a mucus that causes itching.\nIf the eggs get stuck on the person's fingertips when they scratch, they can be transferred to their mouth or on to surfaces and clothes. If other people touch an infected surface, they can then\u00a0transfer the eggs to their mouth.\nThreadworm eggs can survive for up to 2\u00a0weeks before hatching. If the eggs hatch around the anus, the newborn worms can re-enter the bowel. Eggs that have been swallowed will hatch inside the intestine. After 2\u00a0weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again.\nRead more about\u00a0what causes threadworms.\nTreating threadworms\nIf you or your child has threadworms, everyone in your household will need to be treated\u00a0as there's a high\u00a0risk of the infection spreading. This includes those who don't have any symptoms of an infection.\nFor most people, treatment will involve taking a single dose of a medication called\u00a0mebendazole to kill the worms. If necessary, another dose can be taken after 2\u00a0weeks.\nDuring treatment and for a few weeks afterwards, it's also important to follow strict hygiene measures to avoid spreading the threadworm eggs. This includes regularly vacuuming your house and thoroughly washing your bathroom and kitchen.\nIf you're pregnant or breastfeeding, hygiene measures are usually recommended without medication. This is also\u00a0often the case for young children.\u00a0\nRead more about\u00a0treating threadworm infections.\nPreventing threadworms\nIt's not always possible to prevent a threadworm infection, but you can significantly reduce your risk\u00a0by always maintaining good hygiene and encouraging children to do the same.\nChildren should wash their hands regularly, particularly after going to the toilet and before mealtimes. Kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be kept clean.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf your child is infected, encouraging them not to scratch the affected area around their anus or vagina will help prevent reinfection and reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.\n\n\nThreadworms often go unnoticed by people who have them.\nHowever, they can cause intense\u00a0itching around the anus\u00a0(and the vagina in girls), particularly at night when the female worms are laying eggs. This can disturb sleep.\nIn some cases, you may spot threadworms on your bed clothes or sheets at night, or you may notice them in your stools. The worms look like threads of white cotton and are about 1\u00a0centimetre long.\n\n\nA threadworm infection is passed from person to person by swallowing threadworm eggs.\nA female threadworm can lay thousands of tiny eggs around the anus or vagina.\u00a0The female threadworm also releases mucus, which\u00a0can cause an\u00a0itchy bottom.\nScratching the anus or vagina, or wiping them after going to the toilet, can cause the eggs to stick to your fingertips or under your fingernails.\nIf you don't wash your hands, the eggs can be transferred to your mouth or on to food or objects, such as toys and kitchen utensils. If someone else touches a contaminated object, or eats contaminated food and then\u00a0touches their mouth, they'll become infected.\nAfter the eggs have been swallowed they pass into a person's intestine, where they hatch. After about 2 \u00a0weeks the threadworms will have grown into adults, at which point they'll reproduce and the cycle of infection will start again.\nTransferring eggs\nThreadworm eggs can be transferred from your anus (or vagina) to anything you touch, including:\n\nbed\u00a0sheets and\u00a0bed clothes\nflannels and towels\nchildren's toys\nkitchen utensils\ntoothbrushes\nfurniture\nkitchen or bathroom surfaces\n\nThreadworm eggs can survive on surfaces for up to two weeks.\nAs well as being swallowed by a person who touches a contaminated object or surface, threadworm eggs can also be swallowed after being breathed in. This can happen if the eggs become airborne\u00a0\u2013 for example, after shaking a contaminated towel or bed sheet.\nThreadworms only infect humans and aren't spread in animal faeces. However, there's a small risk that threadworms can be caught from pets if the animal's fur becomes contaminated with eggs after an infected person strokes it. If another person then touches the animal's fur, the eggs could be passed on to them.\nWho's at risk?\nThreadworm infections most commonly affect young children because they often forget to wash their hands and they share toys with other children.\nPeople who are in close contact with someone with a threadworm infection also have a high risk of infection. This is why all members of a household\u00a0need to\u00a0be treated when someone has a threadworm infection.\nRead more about\u00a0treating threadworms.\n\n\nTo treat threadworms successfully, all household members must be treated, even if they don't have any symptoms. This is because the risk of the infection spreading is very high.\nThe aim of treatment is to get rid of the threadworms and prevent reinfection. This will usually involve a combination of medication to kill the worms and strict hygiene measures to stop the spread of the eggs.\nThe main medication used to treat threadworms is available from your local pharmacy without a prescription. However, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions\u00a0as it isn't suitable for everyone.\nMedication\nMebendazole\u00a0is the main medication used to treat threadworm infections. It can be bought over the counter from your local pharmacy or\u00a0prescribed by your GP. It's available as a chewable tablet or a liquid.\nMebendazole works by preventing the threadworms absorbing sugar, which means they should die within a few days.\nThis medication is 90-100% effective at killing the threadworms, but it doesn't kill the eggs. This is why the hygiene measures outlined below should also be followed for 6\u00a0weeks.\nVisit your pharmacist if the infection continues two weeks after treatment. They may recommend a second dose of medication.\nIn rare cases, mebendazole can cause abdominal pain or\u00a0diarrhoea, particularly if the threadworm infection is severe.\nHygiene measures\nStrict hygiene measures can help clear up a threadworm infection and reduce the likelihood of reinfection.\nThe lifespan of threadworms is approximately 6\u00a0weeks, so it's important that hygiene measures are followed for at least this length of time. Everyone in the household must follow the advice outlined below.\n\nwash all night clothes, bed linen, towels and soft toys when you're first diagnosed \u2013 this can be done at normal temperatures, but make sure the washing is well rinsed\nthoroughly vacuum and dust the whole house, paying particular attention to the bedrooms \u2013 this should be repeated regularly\ncarefully clean the bathroom and kitchen by damp-dusting surfaces and washing the cloth frequently in hot water \u2013 this should be repeated regularly\navoid shaking any material that may be contaminated with eggs, such as clothing or bed sheets \u2013 this will prevent eggs being transferred to other surfaces\ndon't eat food in the bedroom \u2013 you may end up swallowing eggs that have been shaken off the bedclothes\nkeep your fingernails short \u2013\u00a0encourage other members of your household to do the same\ndiscourage nail-biting and sucking fingers \u2013\u00a0in particular, make sure children don't suck their thumb\nwash your hands frequently and scrub under your fingernails \u2013\u00a0it's particularly important to do this before eating, after going to the toilet, and before and after changing your baby's nappy\nwear close-fitting underwear at night and change your underwear every morning\nbathe or shower regularly \u2013 it's particularly important to bathe or shower first thing in the morning: make sure you clean around your anus and vagina to remove any eggs\nensure everyone in your household has their own face flannel and towel \u2013 don't share towels\nkeep toothbrushes in a closed cupboard and rinse them thoroughly before use\n\nChildren can easily pick up another threadworm infection from friends or at school, so maintaining good hygiene may help prevent reinfection.\nPregnant or breastfeeding women\nMedication isn't usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Instead, you should follow the hygiene measures above.\nSee your GP if you're more than 3\u00a0months pregnant, or if you're breastfeeding and you continue to experience problems\u00a0after only taking hygiene measures. In certain circumstances, your GP may consider prescribing medication.\nChildren under 2\u00a0years old\nMake sure you wash your baby's bottom gently but thoroughly every time you change their nappy. Also wash your hands thoroughly before and after changing their nappy.\nMebendazole isn't licensed for use in children under 2\u00a0years of age, but GPs may decide to prescribe it\u00a0off-label for children over 6\u00a0months.\nIf medication isn't used, the hygiene measures outlined above are recommended instead.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Thyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a small gland at the base of the neck.\nThe most common symptom of\u00a0cancer of the thyroid is a painless lump or swelling that develops in the neck.\nOther symptoms only tend to occur after\u00a0the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include:\n\nunexplained hoarseness that lasts for more than a few weeks\na\u00a0sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn't get better\u00a0\na lump elsewhere\u00a0in your\u00a0neck\n\nIf you have a lump in your thyroid gland, it doesn't necessarily mean you have thyroid cancer.\u00a0About 1 in 20 thyroid lumps are cancerous.\u00a0\nRead more about the symptoms of thyroid cancer\nThe thyroid gland\nThe thyroid gland consists of 2\u00a0lobes located on\u00a0either side of the windpipe. Its main purpose is to release hormones (chemicals that have powerful effects on many different functions of the body).\nThe thyroid gland releases 3\u00a0separate hormones:\n\ntriiodothyronine \u2013\u00a0known as T3\nthyroxine \u2013\u00a0known as T4\ncalcitonin\n\nThe T3 and T4 hormones help regulate the body's metabolic rate (the rate at which the various processes in the body work, such as how quickly calories are burnt).\nAn excess of\u00a0T3 and T4 will make you feel overactive and you\u00a0may lose weight. If you don't have enough of these hormones, you'll feel sluggish and you\u00a0may gain weight.\nCalcitonin helps control blood calcium levels. Calcium is a mineral that performs a number of important functions, such as building strong bones.\nCalcitonin isn't essential for maintaining good health because your body also has other ways of controlling calcium.\nTypes of thyroid cancer\nThere are 4\u00a0main types of thyroid cancer. They are:\n\npapillary carcinoma \u2013 this is the most common type, accounting for about 6 out of 10\u00a0(60%) cases; it usually affects people under the age of 40, particularly women\nfollicular carcinoma \u2013 accounts for around\u00a03 out of 20 (15%) cases of thyroid cancer and tends to affect older adults\nmedullary thyroid carcinoma \u2013 accounts for between 5 and 8 out of every 100 diagnosed cases (5% to 8%); unlike the other types of thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma\u00a0can run in families\u00a0\nanaplastic thyroid carcinoma \u2013 this is the rarest and most aggressive type of thyroid cancer, accounting for less than 1\u00a0in 20 thyroid cancers; it usually affects older people over the age of 60\u00a0\n\nPapillary and follicular carcinomas are sometimes known as differentiated thyroid cancers, and they're often treated in the same way.\nHow common is thyroid cancer?\nThyroid cancer is a rare form of cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cancer cases in the UK.\nIt's most common in people aged 35 to 39 years and in those aged 70 years or over.\nWomen are 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. It's unclear why this is, but it may be\u00a0a result of\u00a0the hormonal changes associated with the female reproductive system.\nWhat causes thyroid cancer?\nIn most cases, the cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.\nRisk factors for thyroid cancer include:\n\nhaving a benign (non-cancerous) thyroid condition\nhaving a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer)\nhaving a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis\nacromegaly\u00a0\u2013 a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone\nhaving a previous benign (non-cancerous) breast condition\nweight and height\nradiation exposure\u00a0\n\nRead more about the causes of thyroid cancer\nDiagnosing thyroid cancer\nA\u00a0type of blood test known as a thyroid function test\u00a0will measure the hormone levels in your blood and rule out or confirm other thyroid problems.\nIf nothing else seems to be causing the lump in your thyroid, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is used.\nFurther testing may be required if the FNAC results are inconclusive, or if more information is needed to make your treatment more effective.\nRead more about how thyroid cancer is diagnosed.\nTreating thyroid cancer\nYour\u00a0recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether a complete cure is realistically achievable.\nDifferentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs)\u00a0are treated using a combination of surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) and a type of\u00a0radiotherapy that destroys any remaining cancer cells and prevents the thyroid cancer returning.\nMedullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than DTCs, so it may be necessary to remove any nearby lymph nodes, as well as your thyroid gland.\nRead more about treating thyroid cancer\nRecurrence\nCancerous cells will return\u00a0in an estimated 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer. In approximately 10% to 15% of people, the cancerous cells will come back in other parts of their body, such as their bones.\nCancerous cells can sometimes\u00a0return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.\u00a0\nYou'll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that return can be treated quickly.\u00a0\nRead more about the complications of thyroid cancer\nPreventing thyroid cancer\nFrom the available evidence, eating a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer.\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least 5 portions a day) and whole grains.\n\n\nIn its early stages, thyroid cancer tends to cause no or very few symptoms.\nThe main symptom of thyroid cancer is a lump or swelling at the front of the neck\u00a0just below your Adam's apple, which is usually painless.\nWomen also have Adam's apples, but they're\u00a0much smaller and less prominent\u00a0than a man's.\nThe lymph nodes in your neck can also be affected and become swollen. Lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the lymphatic system, which helps fight infection.\nOther symptoms of thyroid cancer only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include:\n\nunexplained hoarseness that doesn't get better after a few weeks\na\u00a0sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn't get better\npain in your neck\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should always speak to your GP if you develop a swelling or lump\u00a0at the front of your neck. Although it's unlikely to be thyroid cancer, it's important that\u00a0it is\u00a0investigated.\nAbout 1 in 20 swellings or lumps in the neck are caused by thyroid cancer. Most cases are caused by non-cancerous swellings called\u00a0goitres.\nGoitres\nA\u00a0goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland. Non-cancerous goitres\u00a0are usually caused by other less serious problems with your thyroid gland, such as:\n\ntoo much triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones\u00a0\u2013 this is known as having an overactive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism\nnot enough T3 and T4 hormones\u00a0\u2013 this is known as having an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism\n\nThyroid cancer support\nThe Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust provides information, advice and support for people with thyroid cancer.\nAs well as the website, they also have a helpline number that can be contacted on\u00a001207 545469, Monday to Friday, 10am to 4pm.\n\n\nIn most cases, the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown.\nHowever, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing the condition, including having another thyroid condition and being exposed to\u00a0radiation.\nWhat is cancer?\nCancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and\u00a0reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nLeft untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) located throughout the body.\nLymph nodes\u00a0produce many of the cells needed by your immune system (the body's natural defence system against infection and illness).\nOnce the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it's capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs.\nThe most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas, which are known as differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs).\nThey spread much more slowly than other types of cancer. When DTCs are diagnosed, they're usually limited to the thyroid gland itself or nearby lymph nodes.\nThe rarer types of thyroid cancer are more aggressive and spread faster. By the time medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed, it may have spread to the lymph nodes. In advanced cases, it may have also spread to the bones and lungs.\nAnaplastic thyroid cancer often spreads to the windpipe and, in some cases, the lungs.\nRisk factors for thyroid cancer\nThe main risk factors for developing thyroid cancer are:\n\nhaving a thyroid condition\nhaving a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer)\nhaving a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\nacromegaly (a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone)\nhaving previous benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions\nweight and height\nradiation exposure\n\nYour risk of developing\u00a0thyroid cancer is\u00a0slightly increased if you have certain non-cancerous (benign) thyroid conditions, such as an inflamed thyroid gland\u00a0(thyroiditis) or an\u00a0enlarged thyroid gland (goitre).\nHaving an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) doesn't increase your chances of developing thyroid cancer.\nAround 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0cases of\u00a0thyroid cancer occur in people who've had a previous benign thyroid condition.\nInherited genetic mutations are responsible for a small number of medullary thyroid carcinomas. If the instructions carried in genes are altered, some of the body's processes won't work normally.\nThis inherited mutation occurs in:\n\nfamilial medullary thyroid cancer\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, types 2A and 2B\n\nIn cases of MEN2A or MEN2B thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop during childhood or the teenage years. In familial medullary thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop in adulthood.\nIf one of your parents has a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN syndrome, you should consider having a blood test to find out whether you have the mutated genes. If your test results are positive, it's recommended you have surgery to remove your thyroid gland as a precaution.\nIf you have a bowel condition called\u00a0familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), your risk of developing thyroid cancer is increased. FAP runs in families and is caused by inheriting a faulty gene.\nMacmillan Cancer Support have more information about\u00a0familial adenomatous polyposis.\nThyroid cancer risk is increased in people who have acromegaly.\u00a0This\u00a0is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone.\nIf you've had\u00a0a benign (non-cancerous) breast condition in the past, such as a\u00a0breast cyst or fibroadenoma (non-cancerous tumour), your\u00a0risk of developing thyroid cancer\u00a0increases by around half (50%) compared\u00a0with women who haven't had this type of condition.\nIf you're overweight, you're more at risk of developing thyroid cancer than someone who isn't overweight.\nResearch has\u00a0also shown that\u00a0taller adults\u00a0have\u00a0an increased risk. However, the reasons for this are unclear.\nExposure to radiation during childhood is another risk factor for thyroid cancer.\nRadiation from nuclear fallout and radiation used for medical treatments have both\u00a0been associated with thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany recently reported cases of thyroid cancer are thought to have been caused by radiation exposure during medical procedures carried out between 1910 and 1960.\nDuring this time, not much was known about the risks of radiation treatment. Today there are much stricter regulations regarding the use of radiation for medical procedures.\nOther risk factors\nIf your diet contains low levels of the trace element iodine, you're at an\u00a0increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.\nPeople\u00a0exposed to radiation, or those with\u00a0a history of benign thyroid conditions,\u00a0are more likely to have low levels of iodine.\nEating a lot of butter, cheese and meat may also increase your risk of developing thyroid cancer. To help reduce your risk, you should include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in your diet.\nPeople with a high\u00a0body mass index (BMI) also have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.\u00a0\nWomen are about 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men.\nIt's thought this may be\u00a0because of the\u00a0hormones released during a woman's monthly period or during pregnancy. However, there's little scientific evidence to support this theory.\n\n\nFor many people, the first stage of diagnosing thyroid cancer is a consultation with a GP.\nYour GP will examine your neck and ask about any associated symptoms you may be experiencing, such as unexplained hoarseness.\nThyroid function test\nA blood test known as a thyroid function test is used to check whether the swelling in your neck is caused by other problems with your thyroid gland.\nIt will rule out conditions such as an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), which are the most common thyroid problems.\nA thyroid function test measures the amount of certain types of hormones in your blood.\nFurther tests will be needed if the thyroid function test reveals your thyroid gland is working normally.\nFine-needle aspiration cytology\nFine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)\u00a0is the next stage in diagnosing thyroid cancer. It's an outpatient procedure, which means you won't have to spend the night in hospital.\nA\u00a0small needle\u00a0is inserted into the lump in your neck to allow a tiny sample of cells to be removed. The sample\u00a0is then\u00a0studied under a microscope.\nThis test\u00a0can usually reveal whether cancerous cells are present in your thyroid gland and, if they are, what type of thyroid cancer you have.\nFurther testing\nFurther testing may be recommended if the FNAC results are inconclusive or if further information is needed to make your treatment more effective. These tests may include:\n\nrepeat FNAC combined with an ultrasound scan\nother types of scan, such as a\u00a0computerised tomography (CT) scan or\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\n\nIn most cases, surgery will be recommended to remove the part of the thyroid gland that contains the lump or swelling\u00a0when it hasn't been possible to rule out thyroid cancer.\n\n\nIf you're diagnosed with thyroid cancer, you'll be assigned a care team, who will devise a treatment plan for you.\nYour recommended\u00a0treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether your care team thinks that a complete cure is realistically achievable.\nCancer treatment team\nAll NHS hospitals have multidisciplinary teams (MDTs)\u00a0that treat thyroid cancer. An MDT is made up of a number of different specialists, and may include:\n\na surgeon\nan endocrinologist (a specialist in treating hormonal conditions)\nan oncologist (a cancer treatment specialist)\na pathologist (a specialist in diseased tissue)\na radiotherapist or clinical oncologist (a specialist in non-surgical methods of treating cancer, such as\u00a0chemotherapy and radiotherapy)\na specialist cancer nurse, who will usually be your\u00a0first point of contact with the rest of the team\n\nDeciding on the best course of treatment can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations after reviewing your case, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore you go to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of\u00a0questions to ask\u00a0the specialist. For example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are.\nYour treatment plan\nYour recommended treatment will depend on a number of things, including:\n\nthe type of thyroid cancer you have\nthe grade of your cancer\nwhether your care team thinks\u00a0a complete cure is realistically achievable\n\nMost differentiated thyroid cancers\u00a0\u2013 papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas\u00a0\u2013 and some medullary thyroid carcinomas have a good prospect of achieving a cure.\nDifferentiated thyroid cancers\u00a0are treated using a combination of:\n\nsurgery to remove your thyroid gland (thyroidectomy)\na type of radiotherapy called\u00a0radioactive iodine treatment, which is\u00a0designed to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the thyroid cancer returning\n\nMedullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than differentiated thyroid cancers, so it may be necessary to remove\u00a0your thyroid gland and any nearby lymph nodes.\nRadiotherapy iodine treatment is not effective\u00a0at treating this type of thyroid cancer.\nStage 4 medullary thyroid carcinomas aren't usually curable, but it should be possible to slow their progression and control any associated symptoms.\nIn most cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a cure isn't usually achievable. This is because it's usually spread to other parts of the\u00a0body by the time it's been diagnosed.\nRadiotherapy\u00a0and\u00a0chemotherapy can be used to slow the progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and help control any symptoms.\nSome cases of differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma may benefit from a new type of treatment known as targeted therapies.\nThis is where medication is used to directly target the cancerous cells. However, these\u00a0types of treatments are currently undergoing\u00a0clinical trials and aren't offered routinely on the NHS.\nThyroidectomy\nIn almost all cases of thyroid cancer it's necessary to either remove some of your thyroid gland in a procedure called a hemithyroidectomy, or all of your thyroid gland\u00a0(total thyroidectomy).\nThis decision\u00a0will be influenced by:\n\nthe type of thyroid cancer you have\nthe size of the tumour\nwhether or not the cancer has spread beyond your thyroid gland\n\nYour surgeon should discuss with you the type of surgery required and why so\u00a0you can make an informed decision.\nA thyroidectomy\u00a0is carried out under a general anaesthetic and usually takes around 2\u00a0hours. The operation will leave a small scar on your neck, which\u00a0shouldn't be very noticeable. In a small number of cases, it may cause permanent hoarseness.\nMost people are well enough to leave hospital 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0days after having thyroid surgery. However, you'll need to rest at home for 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0weeks and avoid any activities that could put a strain on your neck, such as heavy lifting.\nA member of your care team will be able to advise you about when you'll be fit enough to resume normal activities and return to work.\nReplacement hormone therapy\nIf some or all of your thyroid gland is removed, it will no longer be able to produce the hormones that regulate your metabolic system.\nThis means you'll experience symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), such as fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight gain and dry skin.\nTo compensate, you'll need to take replacement hormone tablets for the rest of your life.\nIf your surgery is to be followed by radioactive iodine treatment, it's likely you'll be given a hormone tablet called triiodothyronine.\nAfter radioactive iodine treatment is completed, you'll be prescribed an alternative hormone tablet called thyroxine, which most people only need to take once a day.\nYou'll need to have regular blood tests to check you're receiving the right amount of hormones and to determine whether your dose needs to be adjusted.\nIt may take some time to achieve the optimum dose. Until this time, you may experience symptoms of tiredness or weight gain if your hormone levels are too low.\nAlternatively, if your hormone levels are too high, you may experience symptoms such as weight loss, hyperactivity or diarrhoea. You shouldn't experience any more side effects once the\u00a0right dose has been achieved.\nCalcium levels\nOccasionally, the parathyroid glands can be affected during surgery. The parathyroid glands are located close to the thyroid gland and help regulate the levels of calcium in your blood.\nIf your parathyroid glands are affected, your calcium levels may decrease, which can cause a tingling sensation in your hands, fingers, lips and around your nose.\nThese symptoms should be reported to your MDT or GP as you may need to take calcium supplements. Most people only need to take a short course of calcium tablets\u00a0as the parathyroid glands will soon start to function normally again.\nRadioactive iodine treatment\nAfter having thyroid surgery, a course of radioactive iodine treatment may be recommended. This will\u00a0help destroy any remaining cancer cells in your body and prevent the cancer returning.\nIf you're taking thyroid hormone replacement tablets, you'll need to stop taking them for 2 to 4 weeks before having radioactive iodine treatment. This is because they can interfere with the effectiveness of the iodine treatment.\nIf withdrawing your hormone replacement treatment is problematic, you may be given a medicine called recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH). This is given as an injection on 2 consecutive days.\nYour MDT will be able to advise you about whether or not rhTSH is suitable for you.\nRadioactive iodine treatment involves swallowing radioactive iodine in either liquid or capsule form. The\u00a0radiation in the iodine travels up into your neck through your blood supply and destroys any cancerous cells.\nSide effects of radioactive iodine treatment are uncommon, but a small number of people may experience tightness, pain or swelling in their neck and may feel flushed (warm). These side effects usually pass within 24 hours.\nAfter treatment, you may have a\u00a0dry mouth and notice a change in your taste. These symptoms usually disappear after a few weeks or months, although they can be permanent in some people.\nYou'll need to stay in hospital for\u00a03 to 5 days after the procedure because the iodine will make your body slightly radioactive. As a precaution, you'll need to stay in a single room protected by lead sheets so that hospital staff aren't exposed to radiation.\nYou won't be able to have visitors during this time and hospital staff will keep their contact with you to a minimum.\nYour bodily fluids, such as urine, will also\u00a0be slightly radioactive for\u00a03 to 5 days after your treatment, so it's important that you flush the toilet every time you use it. Your sweat will\u00a0be radioactive, too, so you should\u00a0bathe or shower every day.\nYou'll be allowed home after the radioactive levels in your body have subsided.\nWhile having radioactive iodine treatment, you'll need to eat a diet\u00a0low in iodine. An iodine-rich\u00a0diet may reduce the effectiveness of your treatment. It's recommended that you:\n\navoid all seafood\nlimit the amount of dairy products you eat\ndon't take cough medicines or use sea salt\u00a0as they both contain iodine\n\nYou should eat plenty of fresh meat, fresh fruit and vegetables,\u00a0and pasta and rice. These are\u00a0all low in iodine.\nYou shouldn't have radioactive iodine treatment if you're pregnant or if there's a good chance that you may be. The treatment could damage your baby.\nTell a member of your care team if you're unsure whether you're pregnant. Any treatment will need to be delayed until after your pregnancy.\nYou must stop breastfeeding before you can be treated with radioactive iodine. If possible, you should stop breastfeeding\u00a06 weeks prior to treatment.\nYou should not resume breastfeeding after treatment for your current child, but you may safely breastfeed any babies you may have in the future.\nBreastfeeding also isn't recommended while receiving iodine treatment. If you're breastfeeding, you should stop at least 4 weeks (but preferably 8) before starting iodine treatment.\nYou should also not\u00a0resume breastfeeding your baby. However, it's safe for you to breastfeed if you have another child in the future.\nYou should\u00a0use a reliable method of contraception for at least 6 months after having iodine treatment. This is because there's a small risk that any child conceived during this time could develop birth defects. This applies to both men and women.\nRadioactive iodine treatment doesn't affect fertility in women. However,\u00a0there's a small risk that it could affect fertility in men who need to have multiple treatment sessions. Your\u00a0care team will be able to advise you about the level of risk in your individual circumstances.\nIf there's a\u00a0significant risk you'll become infertile after having radioactive iodine treatment, you may wish to consider having your sperm or eggs harvested and frozen so they can be used for fertility treatment at a later date.\nExternal radiotherapy\nExternal radiotherapy, where radioactive waves are targeted at affected parts of the body, is usually only used to treat advanced or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas.\nThe length of time you'll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on the particular type of thyroid cancer you have and its progression.\nSide effects of radiotherapy include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\ntiredness\npain when swallowing\ndry mouth\n\nThese side effects should pass 2 to 3 weeks after your course of radiotherapy has finished.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0is usually only used to treat anaplastic thyroid carcinomas that have spread to other parts of your body.\nIt\u00a0involves taking powerful medicines that kill cancerous cells. It's rarely successful\u00a0in curing anaplastic cancer, but can slow its progression and help relieve symptoms.\nPossible side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\ntiredness\nloss of appetite\nhair loss\u00a0\nmouth ulcers\u00a0\n\nIf you're receiving chemotherapy, you'll also be more vulnerable to infection. See your GP if you suddenly feel ill or your temperature rises above 38C (100.4F).\nTargeted therapies\nA number of targeted therapies are being tested in\u00a0clinical trials to treat advanced cases of:\n\nmedullary thyroid cancers\ndifferentiated thyroid cancers that don't respond to radioactive iodine\nanaplastic thyroid carcinomas\n\nIn targeted therapies, medication specifically targets the biological functions that cancers need to grow and spread.\nAs research is ongoing, some medications used in this type of treatment are unlicensed. In exceptional circumstances, your specialist may suggest using an unlicensed medication. They'll do this if:\n\nthey think it's likely to be effective\nthere are no better alternatives\nthe benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks\n\nIf your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication, they'll tell you that it's unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.\nThe decision about whether to fund treatment with medications used in targeted therapies is often made by individual\u00a0clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about biological therapy for thyroid cancer.\n\n\nCancerous cells can return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.\nIt's\u00a0estimated that 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer will experience a return of cancerous cells in their neck.\nAn estimated 10% to 15% of people will\u00a0see a return of cancerous cells in other parts of their body, such as their bones.\nBecause of\u00a0the risk of cancer cells returning, you'll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that do return can be treated quickly.\nThyroglobulin testing\nThyroglobulin testing is a special type of blood test that's used to monitor some types of thyroid cancer and to check for the return of cancerous cells.\nThyroglobulin is a protein released by a healthy thyroid gland, but it can also be released by cancerous cells.\nIf you've had your thyroid gland removed, there should be no thyroglobulin present in your blood, unless cancerous cells have returned.\nRegularly testing your blood for thyroglobulin can be an effective way of checking whether or not any cancerous cells have returned.\nFor the first few years after having surgery you'll probably need to have thyroglobulin testing every 6 months. After this period, you'll need to be tested once a year.\nUltrasound scan\nAn ultrasound scanner uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of part of the inside of the body. An\u00a0ultrasound scan\u00a0can detect changes inside your neck that could indicate the recurrence of cancer.\nRadioactive iodine scan\nAfter\u00a0surgery to remove part or all of your thyroid gland, you may be asked to attend a radioactive iodine scanning test.\nYou swallow a small amount of radioactive iodine before undergoing a scan. The radioactive iodine will highlight any cancerous thyroid cells in the body.\nBefore the scan, you'll need to go on a low-iodine diet and stop taking your thyroid hormone medication.\nAs\u00a0only a small\u00a0dose of radioactive iodine\u00a0is used, it's not necessary to\u00a0keep your distance from others. However, if you think you may be pregnant or you're breastfeeding, let the doctors know before your test.\nA radioactive iodine scan will\u00a0usually be carried out\u00a06 to 8 months after surgery.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "This section is for teens and young adults.

If you'd like to find out about a different type of thyroid cancer you could\u00a0talk to Macmillan\u00a0Cancer Support.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured.\nSymptoms\nThe first sign of thyroid cancer is usually a painless lump or swelling in the front of the neck that gradually gets bigger.\nLess common symptoms are:\n\na hoarse voice that doesn't get better\ndifficulty swallowing or breathing\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms, it's important to speak to a doctor.\nRemember \u2013 these symptoms can happen for lots of reasons other than cancer.\nWhat are the causes of thyroid cancer?\nIt's unknown exactly what causes thyroid cancer. But research into possible causes is going on all the time. Some things called risk factors increase your chance of developing cancer. But having these doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get cancer.\nGenes are the biological information in each cell that we inherit from our parents. Genes affect the way we look (for example, our eye colour) and how our bodies grow and work. Some rare genetic conditions that run in families can increase the risk of thyroid cancer. But fewer than 1 in 10 cases of cancer are caused by an inherited faulty gene.\nIf you were exposed to radiation or had\u00a0radiotherapy treatment to the neck area when you were younger, you may be at a higher risk of developing thyroid cancer many years later.\nIf you think you might have some of these symptoms you should go straight to your GP. They'll be able to talk to you about your symptoms. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer, they can do\u00a0tests to find out more.\n\n\nThe thyroid is a small gland in the front of the neck just below the voice box (larynx). It is made up of 2 parts, or lobes, 1 on each side of the neck. It's part of a network of glands throughout the body that make up the endocrine system. This system is responsible for producing the body\u2019s hormones that help to control and influence various body functions.\nThe thyroid produces 2 hormones:\n\nthyroid hormone that controls your metabolism\ncalcitonin that helps to control the calcium levels in your body\n\nTypes of thyroid cancer\nThere are 4 main types of thyroid cancer:\n\npapillary is the most common type of thyroid cancer\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s usually slow-growing\nfollicular is the second most common type \u2013 it's also usually slow-growing\nmedullary is a rare type of thyroid cancer which sometimes runs in families\nanaplastic is another rare type of thyroid cancer, which is more common in older people\n\nYoung people are mostly affected by the papillary and follicular types.\nRarely other types of cancer occur in the thyroid gland such as lymphoma, or other cancers that have spread from another part of the body.\nThis section is for teens and young adults. It\u2019s about a type of cancer called thyroid cancer.\nWe also have information on:\n\nthe symptoms and causes of thyroid cancer\nhaving tests for thyroid cancer\ntreatment of thyroid cancer\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our\u00a0thyroid cancer section.\n\n\nThis information is for teenagers and young adults who may be having tests to find out if they have thyroid cancer.\nIf you think you might have some of the symptoms of thyroid cancer, you should talk to your GP. If they think the symptoms could be because of cancer, they can do tests to find out more.\nVisiting your GP\nWhen you go to your GP they will usually examine you and arrange some blood tests. There may be a number of reasons why you have these symptoms. If your GP is concerned that you may have thyroid cancer they will make an appointment for you with a specialist at the hospital.\nAt the hospital\nYou\u2019ll probably be seen by lots of people at the hospital during and after the tests they do to find out what is happening to you. They work as a team and all have an important part in your care, even though you may only meet some of them.\nThey may include:\n\na doctor who specialises in thyroid problems (endocrinologist)\na surgeon who specialises in thyroid surgery\na pathologist who looks at blood and tissue samples to diagnose diseases\na cancer specialist (oncologist)\nan X-ray specialist (radiologist)\na clinical nurse specialist\n\nYour doctor will examine you and arrange for more detailed tests, which may include an ultrasound, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or a biopsy.\nAn FNA involves having a very small needle placed into your thyroid gland to remove a few cells for the pathologist to look at under the microscope.\nA biopsy involves removing a small piece of the thyroid to be analysed. You might have a general anaesthetic and so will be asleep when it is done. You may only need a local anaesthetic, which numbs the area. There is more information about having an anaesthetic in the surgery section.\nIf the biopsy shows that it is thyroid cancer you will have some other tests to check the size of the tumour and whether it has spread. Macmillan Cancer Support has information on these tests. These tests may include:\n\na chest\nX-ray to check your lungs\na CT, MRI or PET\u00a0scan\na radioisotope scan\n\nYou won\u2019t necessarily need all of these tests. It will depend on the results of the first ones.\nHaving tests and waiting for the results can be an anxious time. Talking about how you feel and getting support from your family, friends, specialist nurse or doctor can help.\nWe have more information about:\n\nsigns and symptoms of thyroid cancer\ntreating thyroid cancer\u00a0\n\nIf you're looking for information about thyroid cancer in people of all ages, read our general\u00a0thyroid cancer information.\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that thyroid cancer in young people can be successfully treated. Most young people are completely cured. If the\u00a0tests\u00a0you\u2019ve had show you have thyroid cancer, your team of specialists will discuss treatment with you.\nSurgery\nSurgery to remove the thyroid gland is the main treatment for thyroid cancer. You might hear the doctors talk about a thyroidectomy, which is the medical name for the operation. Sometimes the surgeon will only need to remove part of your thyroid.\nIn the neck, close to the thyroid,\u00a0there are lymph nodes. These are part of the body\u2019s immune system and help fight infection. Sometimes cancer cells settle in these lymph nodes, so the surgeon might remove some or all of the nodes as well. They may also remove some tissue from the area around the thyroid if they suspect that there are any cancer cells there.\nYou will probably need to spend a few days in hospital after the operation. There will be a scar on your neck \u2013 usually just above the collarbone. Sometimes you can have a low calcium level in your blood or a hoarse voice after the operation. You may need to take tablets to replace the thyroid hormone.\nThe tissue removed will be carefully looked at under the microscope. Sometimes another operation is needed after this. The results will help your doctors decide if you need radioactive iodine treatment and other treatments. Your team will talk through the results of the operation with you.\nYou may feel really shocked and scared by the thought of having this operation. But it does give a really good chance of a cure. Your specialist will talk things over with you in detail and make sure that you fully understand what\u2019s involved. If you want to know more about what happens when you go in for an operation, there\u2019s lots more information in the general\u00a0surgery section.\nRadioactive iodine\nIf you\u2019ve been told that you need to have treatment with radioactive iodine, you may be worried about what\u2019s going to happen. Knowing what to expect can help.\nYour doctors and nurses will also explain things to you and give you support.\nThere's\u00a0a mineral called iodine in the bloodstream. Normal thyroid tissue takes iodine from the bloodstream and uses it to make thyroid hormones. Some thyroid cancers can take iodine from the bloodstream too.\nRadioactive iodine is often used after surgery when the whole thyroid gland has been removed. Any thyroid cancer cells left behind soak up the iodine which contains high doses of radiation. This helps to destroy them. Radioactive iodine doesn\u2019t usually affect other parts of the body because other cells don\u2019t take up iodine the way thyroid cells do.\nYou may have radioactive iodine as a capsule, as a drink or as an injection into a vein in your arm through a cannula.\nThere are 2 ways to prepare your body for the radioiodine treatment, either you'll:\n\nbe given an injection of a drug called thyrotropin alfa (Thyrogen\u00ae)\nneed to stop taking your thyroid hormone tablets 2 to 4 weeks before the treatment\n\nSome people won\u2019t be started on thyroid hormones until after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment. You\u2019ll probably feel very tired during this time. But, if you are not having the injections, it\u2019s important that you stop taking thyroid hormones or the radioactive iodine treatment won\u2019t work.\nFor 2 weeks before treatment, you\u2019ll be asked to eat a low-iodine diet and avoid certain foods. This encourages the body to use up its stores of iodine. Then when the radioactive iodine is given, the cancer cells will soak it up because the amount of iodine in the body is so low. You\u2019ll be given information about what foods you should eat and what to avoid.\nYou can\u2019t have this treatment if you are pregnant. If there is any chance of this tell your team and they can test you.\nThis treatment makes you slightly radioactive for several weeks. Your body will gradually get rid of the radioactivity through your wee, sweat and saliva. You will be kept in hospital when the radioactivity is highest, which is usually between 1\u00a0to 5 days. You will be looked after in a side room on the ward, either on your own or with someone else having the same treatment.\nDuring this treatment, the amount of contact you can have with your friends, family and the nurses will be limited, to protect them from exposure to the radiation. Anyone pregnant or younger than 18 usually isn\u2019t allowed to visit. This can make you feel lonely. You will be able to keep in touch with your friends and family by phone and internet. There should be plenty of books, magazines, DVDs, computer games and a TV in the room. You can take in a few of your own things in to help pass the time. Ask your team whether you can take a computer or an MP3 player into the room with you. Anything that comes back out of your room will be checked for radiation levels. Sometimes your things may have to be kept on the ward for a while if the radiation levels are high. But they\u2019ll be returned to you when they\u2019re safe again.\nOnce your radiation levels are safe, you\u2019ll be allowed home. You\u2019ll also be able to start eating your usual foods again. Check with the staff about what you can and can\u2019t do when you get home. There are likely to be some precautions to take for up to a few weeks.\nYou might need a scan shortly after your treatment. This shows if you need more radioiodine treatment. If you need more treatment it is usually given every 3\u00a0to 6 months.\nYour fertility won\u2019t be affected by the treatment. But it\u2019s safer not to become pregnant or get someone else pregnant during treatment, and for a year after. You should avoid all sex and open-mouthed kissing for a few days after treatment.\nTravelling on public transport can be restricted just after treatment, so you may not be able to go on holiday just after treatment. For a few months after treatment you might set off the alarms at the security gates. If you are planning a holiday, discuss it with your team.\nExternal beam radiotherapy\nYou may also have external beam radiotherapy. For this treatment you come to hospital and lie on a bed in the radiotherapy department for about 10 to 20 minutes every day. You will have treatment every weekday for several weeks. It is like having an X-ray, so it doesn\u2019t hurt and you cannot feel it.\u00a0\nHormone therapy after treatment for thyroid cancer\nIf you\u2019ve had all your thyroid gland removed, your body can\u2019t produce thyroid hormones anymore. Without these hormones, your metabolism slows down. This can cause dry skin and hair, tiredness, poor concentration and lack of energy.\nThese hormones can be replaced by taking tablets. You\u2019ll need to take them for the rest of your life. The usual long-term hormone treatment is thyroxine (levothyroxine) and you normally start taking it once your radioactive iodine treatment is finished.\nAs well as replacing the hormones you\u2019re missing, thyroxine can also help stop papillary or follicular thyroid cancer coming back. So if you have only had part of your thyroid gland removed you may still need to take thyroid hormone tablets.\nYou\u2019ll need to have your blood checked regularly to monitor the hormone levels. It can sometimes take months to find the right dose of thyroxine for you. But once the right dose is found, there shouldn\u2019t be any side effects, because they are simply replacing normal thyroid hormones.\nIt\u2019s important to remember to take your tablets every day. It can help to take them at the same time every day so you get into a routine.\nMacmillan Cancer Support\u00a0has more general information about radiotherapy,\u00a0surgery and\u00a0radioactive iodine treatment.

For some people it may come and go and only be a minor irritation.\nHowever, for some people, it can have a significant impact on everyday life and be very distressing, affect concentration, and cause problems such as difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression.\nIn many cases, tinnitus will get better gradually over time, either by disappearing or by the body getting used to it (habituation). But it's important to seek medical advice to see if an underlying cause can be found and treated, and to help you find ways to cope with the problem.\nWhen to see your GP\nYou should see your GP if you continually or regularly hear sounds such as buzzing, ringing or humming in your ears.\nThey can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition they could easily treat, such as an ear infection or earwax build-up. They can also do some simple checks to see if you have any hearing loss.\nIf necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests and treatment.\nRead more about diagnosing tinnitus.\nWhat causes tinnitus?\nTinnitus can develop gradually over time or occur suddenly. It's not clear exactly why it happens, but it often occurs along with some degree of hearing loss.\nTinnitus is often associated with:\n\nage-related hearing loss\ninner ear damage caused by repeated exposure to loud noises\nan earwax build-up\na middle ear infection\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \u2013 a condition that also causes hearing loss and vertigo (a spinning sensation)\notosclerosis \u2013 an inherited condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss\n\nHowever, around one in every three people with tinnitus doesn't have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing.\nRead more about the causes of tinnitus.\nWho is affected?\nMost people have experienced short periods of tinnitus after being exposed to loud noises, such as after a music concert.\nIn the UK, more persistent tinnitus is estimated to affect around six million people (10% of the population) to some degree, with about 600,000 (1%) experiencing it to a severity that affects their quality of life.\nTinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children, but is more common in people aged over 65.\nTreating tinnitus\nThere's currently no single treatment for tinnitus that works for everyone. However, research to find an effective treatment is continuing.\nIf an underlying cause of your tinnitus can be found, effectively treating it may help improve your tinnitus \u2013 for example, removing a build-up of earwax might help.\nIf a specific cause can't be found, treatment will focus on helping you manage the condition on a daily basis. This may involve:\n\nsound therapy \u2013 listening to neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus\ncounselling \u2013 therapy that aims to educate you about tinnitus and help you learn to cope with it more effectively\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 therapy that aims to help change the way you think about your tinnitus so it becomes less noticeable\ntinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) \u2013 therapy that aims to help retrain the way your brain responds to tinnitus so you start to tune the sound out and become less aware of it\n\nRead more about how tinnitus is treated.\n\n\nIt's not clear exactly what causes tinnitus, but it's thought to be a problem with how the ear hears sounds and how the brain interprets them.\nMany cases are associated with hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear, although around one person in every three with the condition doesn't have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing.\nInner ear damage\nSounds pass from the outer ear through to the inner ear, which contains the cochlea and auditory nerve. The cochlea is a coiled, spiral tube containing a large number of sensitive hair cells. The auditory nerve transmits sound signals to the brain.\nIf part of the cochlea is damaged, it will stop sending information to your brain. The brain may then actively \"seek out\" signals from parts of the cochlea that still work. These signals might then become over-represented in the brain, which may cause the sounds of tinnitus.\nIn older people, damage to the cochlea often occurs naturally with age. In younger people, it can be caused by repeated exposure to excessive noise.\nOther causes\nAs well as inner ear damage, there are several other possible causes of tinnitus. These include:\n\nan earwax build-up that blocks the ear\na middle ear infection\nglue ear \u2013 a build-up of fluid in the middle ear\na perforated eardrum\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \u2013 a condition that also causes hearing loss and vertigo (a spinning sensation)\notosclerosis \u2013 an inherited condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss\n\nRarer causes\nLess commonly, tinnitus may develop as a result of:\n\na head injury\nexposure to a sudden or very loud noise, such as an explosion or gunfire\nanaemia \u2013 a reduced number of red blood cells that can sometimes cause the blood to thin and circulate so rapidly that it produces a sound\nreactions to certain medications, such as some chemotherapy medicines, antibiotics, diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin (this is more likely to occur at very high doses)\nacoustic neuroma \u2013 a rare non-cancerous growth that affects the hearing nerve in the inner ear\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension) and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)\nan overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\ndiabetes\nPaget's disease \u2013 where the normal cycle of bone renewal and repair is disrupted\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou should see your GP if you have a problem with your hearing, such as hearing ringing or buzzing sounds.\nThey will ask you some questions about your symptoms, such as:\n\nDoes the sound come and go, or is it continuous?\nDoes the problem affect one or both ears?\nIs it a constant tone or is it like a pulse?\nIs the problem having an impact on your everyday life?\nHave you noticed any other symptoms, such as hearing loss or vertigo (a spinning sensation)?\n\nThey may also want to know whether you're taking any medication that could cause the condition, such as high doses of antibiotics or aspirin.\nThey will examine the outside and inside of your ear to check for obvious problems they may be able to treat, such as an earwax build-up or an ear infection. If you have a pulsatile tinnitus they will also listen to your neck and side of the head with a stethoscope.\nThey might also carry out a simple test of your hearing (free field speech testing and tuning fork tests) and arrange blood tests to look for conditions sometimes associated with tinnitus, such as anaemia (a reduction in red blood cells), diabetes or a problem with your thyroid gland.\nSeeing a specialist\nIn some cases, your GP may refer you to a hearing specialist called an audiologist, who can carry out a range of hearing tests and talk to you about the treatments available.\nAlternatively, you may be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your hospital. An ENT specialist may see you directly or organise a CT scan or MRI scan before arranging an appointment with ENT or Audiology depending on the results.\n\n\nThere's not usually a quick fix for tinnitus, but it will often improve gradually over time. A number of treatments are available to help you cope.\nIf your tinnitus is caused by an underlying health condition, treating the condition will help stop or reduce the sounds you hear.\nFor example, if your tinnitus is caused by an earwax build-up, eardrops or ear irrigation may be used. Ear irrigation involves using a pressurised flow of water to remove the earwax.\nRead more about how an earwax build-up is treated.\nHowever, in many cases a cause for tinnitus can't be found, so treatments will be used to help you manage the problem on a daily basis. These are described below.\nCorrecting hearing loss\nAny degree of hearing loss you have should be addressed because straining to listen can make tinnitus worse.\nCorrecting even fairly minor hearing loss means the parts of the brain involved in hearing don't have to work as hard and therefore don't pay as much attention to the tinnitus.\nA specialist will test your hearing and recommend appropriate treatment. This could involve having a hearing aid fitted, and occasionally surgery.\nImproving your hearing will also mean sounds you wouldn't otherwise hear will now be audible, which may help override the sounds of your tinnitus.\nRead more about treating hearing loss.\nSound therapy\nTinnitus is often most noticeable in quiet environments. The aim of \"sound therapy\" or \"sound enrichment\" is to fill any silence with neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus.\nThis may involve simple measures such as opening a window to hear noises coming from outside, leaving a radio or television on, or listening to sounds on a portable music player.\nYou can get specially-designed sound generators that look similar to a radio. These produce quiet natural sounds, such as leaves rustling in the wind and waves lapping on the shore. White noise generators are similar devices that produce a continuous \"shushing\" sound at a level that's comfortable and soothing.\nAlso available are pillows containing built-in speakers to help distract you from tinnitus when you go to sleep, and small sound-generator devices that fit in your ear like a hearing aid. Some hearing aids have built-in sound generators for people with tinnitus.\nCounselling\nUnderstanding tinnitus plays an important part in learning how to cope with the condition and manage it more effectively.\nTinnitus counseling is a type of therapy where you work with a healthcare professional to help you learn more about your tinnitus and find ways of coping with it. It's usually carried out by hearing therapists, audiologists (hearing disorder specialists) or doctors.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is often used to treat mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. It's based on the idea that your thoughts affect the way you behave. Treatment aims to retrain the way you think to change your behaviour.\nThis technique can be effectively applied to tinnitus. For example, if your knowledge about tinnitus is limited, you may have certain ideas about it that make you feel anxious and depressed. This can make your tinnitus worse.\nChanging the way you think about your tinnitus and what you do about it can help reduce your anxiety and enable you to accept the noises, which after a while may become less noticeable.\nTinnitus retraining therapy (TRT)\nTinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is a special type of therapy that aims to help retrain the way your brain responds to tinnitus so you start to tune the sound out and become less aware of it. The therapy involves a combination of more intensive sound therapy and long-term counselling.\nTRT is widely available privately and may be available on the NHS for people with very severe or persistent tinnitus. It should only be carried out by someone specially trained in the technique.\nSelf-help\nSome people find self-help techniques useful for managing their tinnitus. These techniques include:\n\nrelaxation \u2013 stress can make your tinnitus worse, so relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and yoga may help\nlistening to music \u2013 calming music and sounds may help you relax and fall asleep at bedtime\nsleep hygiene \u2013 if tinnitus is affecting your sleep, sleep hygiene measures such as sticking to a regular sleep pattern and avoiding caffeine or alcohol shortly before going to bed may help\nhobbies and activities \u2013 having a hobby or regularly participating in any activity you find enjoyable may help distract you from tinnitus\nsupport groups \u2013 sharing your experiences with others who have tinnitus may help you cope better\n\nAction on Hearing Loss provide further details about support and activities in your local area.\u00a0Their free information line telephone number is 0808 808 0123.\nYou may also find the British Tinnitus Association a useful source of information.

It's usually caused by a viral infection or, less commonly, a bacterial infection.\nTonsillitis is a common condition in children, teenagers and young adults.\nThe\u00a0symptoms of tonsillitis\u00a0include:\n\na sore throat\u00a0and pain when\u00a0swallowing\nearache\nhigh temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F)\ncoughing\nheadache\n\nSymptoms usually pass within three to four days.\nIf necessary, your GP will examine your throat and ask you some questions about your symptoms. If needed, a throat swab can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. The results usually take a few days to return.\nIf your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, they may prescribe antibiotics. Typical signs of a bacterial infection include white pus-filled spots on\u00a0the tonsils, no cough and swollen\u00a0or tender lymph glands.\nIf you develop severe tonsillitis as a teenager or adult, your GP may recommend a\u00a0blood test\u00a0for glandular fever.\nThe tonsils\nThe tonsils are two small glands that sit on either side of the throat. In young children, they help to fight\u00a0germs and act as a barrier against infection.\nWhen the tonsils become infected, they isolate the infection and stop it spreading further into the body.\nAs a child's\u00a0immune system develops and gets stronger, the tonsils become less important and usually shrink. In most people, the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils.\nRemoval of the\u00a0tonsils\u00a0is usually only recommended if they're causing problems, such as severe or repeated episodes of tonsillitis (see below).\nWhat causes tonsillitis?\nMost cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as the viruses that cause the common cold or flu virus (influenza).\nSome cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria.\nThese types of infections spread easily, so it's important to try to avoid passing the infection on to others by:\n\nstaying away from public places, such as work, school or nursery, until your GP says it's safe to return (usually after the symptoms have passed)\ncoughing and sneezing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue\u00a0\nwashing hands before eating, after going to the toilet and, if possible, after coughing and sneezing\n\nRead more about the causes of tonsillitis.\nTreating tonsillitis\nThere's no specific treatment for tonsillitis, but you may be able to reduce the symptoms by:\n\ntaking paracetamol\u00a0or\u00a0ibuprofen to help relieve pain\ndrinking plenty of fluids\ngetting plenty of rest\n\nIf test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, a short course of oral antibiotics may be prescribed.\nIf oral antibiotics aren't effective at treating bacterial tonsillitis, intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed in hospital.\nIn most cases, tonsillitis gets better within a week. However, a small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer, or it keeps returning. This is known as chronic tonsillitis and surgical treatment may be needed.\nSurgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended\u00a0if:\n\nyou've had several severe episodes of tonsillitis over a long period of time\nrepeated episodes are disrupting normal activities\n\nRead more about treating tonsillitis.\nComplications of tonsillitis\nComplications of tonsillitis are rare and usually only occur if it's caused by a bacterial infection. They're usually the result of the infection spreading to another part of the body.\nPossible complications of tonsillitis include:\n\na middle ear infection (otitis media)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where fluid between the eardrum and inner ear becomes infected by bacteria\nquinsy (peritonsillar abscess)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an\u00a0abscess (collection of pus) that develops between one of the tonsils and the wall of the throat\nobstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where the walls of the throat relax during sleep, which causes breathing difficulties and\u00a0poor sleep\n\nOther complications of tonsillitis are very rare and usually only occur if an underlying bacterial infection is left untreated. They include:\n\nscarlet fever\u00a0\u2013 a condition that causes a distinctive pink-red skin rash\nrheumatic fever\u00a0\u2013 this causes widespread inflammation throughout the body, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, rashes and jerky body movements\nglomerulonephritis\u00a0\u2013 an infection (swelling) of the filters in the kidneys that can cause vomiting and a loss of appetite\n\n\n\nThe main symptom of tonsillitis is a sore throat.\nYour tonsils will be red and swollen, and your throat may be very painful, making swallowing difficult.\nIn some cases, the tonsils are coated or have white, pus-filled spots on them.\nOther common symptoms of tonsillitis\u00a0include:\n\nhigh temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F)\ncoughing\nheadache\nearache\nfeeling sick\nfeeling tired\nswollen, painful\u00a0lymph glands in your neck\nloss of voice or changes to your voice\n\nThe symptoms of tonsillitis usually get better after three to four days.\nIf\u00a0you have tonsillitis that's caused by\u00a0a viral infection, such as the common cold or flu,\u00a0your symptoms may be milder.\nIf your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, such as a streptococcal infection, your symptoms will usually be more severe and you may also have bad breath.\nIt's difficult to tell just by looking at a person's throat whether they have tonsillitis as a\u00a0result of a virus or a bacterial infection. Tests are needed to confirm this.\nAntibiotics may be recommended if test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection.\n\n\nMost cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection.\nViruses known to cause tonsillitis include:\n\nrhinoviruses \u2013 which cause the common cold\nthe influenza virus\nparainfluenza virus \u2013 which causes laryngitis and croup\nenteroviruses \u2013 which cause hand, foot and mouth disease\nadenovirus \u2013 which is a common cause of diarrhoea\nthe rubeola virus \u2013 which causes measles\n\nIn rare cases, tonsillitis can also be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes glandular fever.\nIf this is the case, you'll probably\u00a0feel very ill. You'll have a\u00a0sore throat and the lymph glands in your throat may be swollen. You may also have a fever and feel very tired.\nBacterial tonsillitis\nBacterial tonsillitis can\u00a0be caused by a number of different bacteria, but it's usually due to group A streptococcus bacteria.\nIn the past, serious bacterial infections, such as diphtheria and rheumatic fever, have been linked with tonsillitis. However, this is now rare, because these conditions are vaccinated against and treatment for them has greatly improved.\nHow tonsillitis is spread\nTonsillitis itself isn't contagious, but the infections that cause it are.\nViruses, such as those that cause colds and flu, are spread through coming into close contact with someone who's infected.\nWhen an infected person coughs or sneezes, the virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of their nose and mouth. You can become infected by breathing in the contaminated droplets. This is known as direct contact.\nYou can also become infected if you touch a surface or object that the droplets have landed on and then touch your face. This is known as indirect contact.\n\n\nThere's no specific treatment for tonsillitis and most cases get better within a week without treatment.\nWhile waiting for the infection to clear up, there are a number of things you can do to help relieve your symptoms (see below).\nIf your child has tonsillitis, make sure they have plenty to eat and drink, even if they find it painful to swallow. Being hungry and dehydrated can make other symptoms, such as\u00a0headaches and tiredness, worse.\nSelf-help\nOver-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, can help relieve painful symptoms such as a sore throat.\nIf treating your children with painkillers, it's important to use the correct type and dosage. Younger children only need small dosages. Your pharmacist can advise you about this.\nChildren under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin.\nOver-the-counter treatments that can soothe a sore throat, such as lozenges and oral sprays, are also available. Some people find that gargling with a mild antiseptic solution can also relieve a sore throat.\nAlternatively, you could try gargling with warm, salty water. Mix half a teaspoon of salt (2.5g) with a quarter of a litre (eight ounces) of water. It's important not to swallow the water, so this method may not be suitable for younger children.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics may not be prescribed, even if tests confirm your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection. The two main reasons for this are:\n\nin most cases, antibiotics won't speed up the recovery, but they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as stomach pain and feeling sick\nthe more an antibiotic is used to treat a non-serious infection, the greater the chance it won't be effective in treating more serious infections; this is known as antibiotic resistance\n\nHowever, exceptions are usually\u00a0made if:\n\nsymptoms are severe\nsymptoms show no sign of easing\nyou or your child has\u00a0a weakened immune system\n\nIn these circumstances, a 10-day course of penicillin is usually recommended. If you or your child is known to be allergic to penicillin, an alternative antibiotic, such as erythromycin, can be used.\nHospital treatment may be required for particularly severe or persistent cases of bacterial tonsillitis that don't respond to oral antibiotics. In these cases, intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed.\nAntibiotics sometimes cause mild side effects, such as an upset stomach, diarrhoea or a rash.\nSurgery to remove the tonsils is known as a tonsillectomy.\nFor children with mild sore throats, watchful waiting is recommended rather than a tonsillectomy.\nA tonsillectomy is only considered for a recurrent sore throat if certain criteria are met. You must have:\n\na sore throat caused by tonsillitis\nepisodes of sore throat that are disabling and stop you functioning normally\nseven\u00a0or more well-documented, clinically significant, adequately treated sore throats in the preceding year or\nfive or more such episodes in each of the preceding two years or\nthree or more such episodes in each of the preceding three years\n\nTonsillectomies are carried out\u00a0under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be asleep during the procedure. Your mouth will be held open to allow the surgeon to see your tonsils and no cuts will be made in your skin.\nThe operation can be carried out in a number of ways, as described below.\n\nCold steel surgery \u2013 this is the most common method, where a surgical blade is used to cut the tonsils out. Bleeding is controlled by applying pressure or the blood vessels may be sealed using heat generated by diathermy.\nDiathermy \u2013 a diathermy probe is used to destroy the tissue around the tonsils and to remove the tonsils. At the same time, the heat seals the blood vessels to stop any bleeding.\nCoblation (or cold ablation) \u2013 this method works in a similar way to diathermy, but uses a lower temperature (60C). It's considered less painful than diathermy.\nLasers \u2013\u00a0high-energy laser beams are used to cut away the tonsils and seal the underlying blood vessels shut.\nUltrasound \u2013 high-energy ultrasound waves are used in a similar way to lasers.\n\nEach of these techniques is relatively similar in terms of safety, results and recovery, so the type of surgery used will depend on the expertise and training of the surgeon.\nYou'll usually be able to leave hospital on the same day as you have surgery, or the day after.\nAfter surgery, it's likely you'll experience some pain at the site of the operation. This can last for up to a week. Painkillers can help to relieve the pain.\nChildren who have had a tonsillectomy should be kept off school for two weeks. This is to reduce their risk of picking up an infection from another child that will make them feel more uncomfortable.\nSwallowing will probably be difficult after having a tonsillectomy. However, it's important to eat solid foods, because it will help your throat to heal more quickly. Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid acidic drinks, such as orange juice, because they'll sting.\nEnsuring good oral hygiene by regularly brushing your teeth and using mouthwash can help prevent infection in the mouth.\nThe pain usually gets worse during the first week after having a tonsillectomy, before gradually improving during the second week. Earache is common with tonsillectomies, but isn't a cause for concern.\nPost-operative bleeding\nBleeding at the site where the tonsils were removed is a fairly common complication of a tonsillectomy. This can occur during the first 24 hours following surgery or up to 10 days afterwards.\nIt's estimated that around 1 in 100 children and 1 in 30 adults will experience post-operative bleeding after having a tonsillectomy.\nMinor bleeding isn't usually a cause for concern, because in most cases it resolves by itself. Gargling with cold water can often help stem the bleeding, because the cold helps to contract the blood vessels.\nOccasionally, the bleeding can be more severe, causing people to cough up blood. Seek immediate medical advice if this happens. You should be given an emergency contact number before you're discharged from hospital. Alternatively, you can call NHS 24's\u00a0'111' service.\nExtensive bleeding may need to be treated with surgery or a blood transfusion.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, severe facial pain, described as sharp, shooting or like an electric shock.\nIt usually occurs in sudden short attacks lasting from a few seconds to about two minutes, which stop just as abruptly.\nIn the vast majority of cases it affects part or all of one side of the face,\u00a0with the pain most commonly felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time.\nPeople with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. In severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day.\nIt's possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. Some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks.\nTypically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. Sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever.\nLiving with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression.\nRead more about the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia\nWhen to seek medical advice\nYou should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as\u00a0paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.\nYour GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain.\nHowever, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult, and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed.\nRead more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia\nWhat causes trigeminal neuralgia?\nIn the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain.\nThis compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull.\nIn rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such as\u00a0multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour.\nRead more about the causes of trigeminal neuralgia\nWho is affected\nIt's not clear exactly how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but the condition is thought to be rare.\nSome studies have suggested that around 27 in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year, although this figure is probably too high as the condition tends to be over-diagnosed by doctors. Other estimates have suggested that there are about 6,500 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK.\nThe condition affects women more often than men and is rare in people under the age of 40, although it can occur in younger people. Most cases are first seen in people between the ages of 50 and 60.\nHow trigeminal neuralgia is treated\nTrigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition, and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. However, most cases can be controlled to at least some degree with treatment.\nThe first treatment offered will usually be with an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat\u00a0epilepsy) called carbamazepine. To be effective, this medication needs to be taken several times a day, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so that high enough levels of the medication can build up in your bloodstream.\nUnless your pain starts to diminish or disappears altogether, the medication is usually continued for as long as is necessary, sometimes for many years. If you are entering a period of remission and your pain goes away, stopping the medication should always be done slowly over days or weeks, unless you are advised otherwise by a doctor.\nCarbamazepine was not originally designed to treat pain, but it can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages.\nIf this medication is ineffective, unsuitable or causes too many side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medications or surgical procedures that may help.\nThere are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia \u2013 usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals \u2013 but these are generally only effective for a few years.\nAlternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open up your skull and move away any blood vessels compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results in terms of long-term pain relief, but it is a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as\u00a0hearing loss,\u00a0facial numbness or, very rarely, a stroke.\nRead more about treating trigeminal neuralgia\n\n\nThe main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes.\nThe pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees.\nTrigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. In rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. The pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye.\nYou may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly.\nAfter the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. There may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks.\nYou may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. It is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as \"remission\"). However, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission.\nSymptom triggers\nAttacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as:\n\ntalking\nsmiling\nchewing\nbrushing your teeth\nwashing your face\na light touch\nshaving or putting on make-up\nswallowing\nkissing\na cool breeze or air conditioning\nhead movements\nvibrations, such as walking or a car journey\n\nHowever, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever.\nFurther problems\nLiving with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected.\nYou may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. However, it's important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse.\nThe emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such as depression. During periods of extreme pain, some people may even consider suicide. Even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning.\nWhen to see your GP\nYou should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as paracetamol\u00a0and ibuprofen\u00a0do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.\nYour GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose, so it\u2019s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible.\nRead more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia\n\n\nAlthough the exact cause is not known, trigeminal neuralgia is often thought to be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve or an underlying condition affecting this nerve.\nThe trigeminal nerve\nThe trigeminal nerve (also called the fifth cranial nerve) is the largest nerve inside the skull. You have two trigeminal nerves, one in each side of your face. Small branches from different parts of the face join into three major nerve branches. These are:\n\nthe upper branch (ophthalmic) \u2013 which carries sensory information from the skin above the eye, forehead and front of the head\nthe middle branch (maxillary) \u2013 which carries sensory information from the skin through the cheek, side of the nose, upper jaw, teeth and gums\nthe lower branch (mandibular) \u2013 which carries sensory information from the skin through the lower jaw, teeth and gums\n\nThese branches enter the skull through three different routes and then join together in what is called the Gasserian ganglion, before connecting to the brainstem in the part of the skull called the posterior fossa.\u00a0\nTrigeminal neuralgia can involve one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The maxillary and mandibular branches are affected most often, and the ophthalmic branch is the least commonly affected.\nPressure on the trigeminal nerve\nEvidence suggests that in up to 95% of cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is pressure on the trigeminal nerve close to where it enters the brain stem (the lowest part of the brain that merges with the spinal cord), past the Gasserian ganglion.\nIn most cases, this pressure seems to be caused by an artery or vein compressing the trigeminal nerve, although it's not known why this happens.\nIt's also not clear exactly why this pressure can cause painful attacks, as not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve will experience pain. It may be that, in some people, the pressure on the nerve wears away its protective outer layer called the myelin sheath, which may cause uncontrollable pain signals to travel along the nerve.\u00a0\nHowever, this does not fully explain why periods of remission (periods without symptoms) can occur and why pain relief is immediate after a successful operation to move the blood vessels away from the nerve.\nOther underlying causes\nOther reasons why the trigeminal nerve can become compressed or damaged include:\n\na tumour (a growth or lump)\na cyst (fluid-filled sac)\narteriovenous malformation (an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins)\nmultiple sclerosis (MS) \u2013 a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)\n\n\n\nAs the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia is often felt in the jaw, teeth or gums, it is common for people to visit their dentist initially, rather than their GP.\nIf you visit your dentist, they will ask you questions about your symptoms and investigate your facial pain using a dental X-ray and other means to look for other more common causes, such as a dental infection or cracked tooth.\u00a0\nIf the dentist cannot find a cause, it is important not to undergo unnecessary treatment such as a root canal filling or an extraction, even though you may be convinced that it is a tooth problem. If your dentist can't find anything wrong, do not try to persuade them to remove a particular tooth, as this will not solve the problem.\nOften, the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is made by a dentist, but if you have already seen your dentist and they have not been able to find an obvious cause of your pain, visit your GP.\nSeeing your GP\nThere is no specific test for trigeminal neuralgia, so a diagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and your description of the pain.\nIf you have experienced facial pain, your GP will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as how often they occur, how long the pain attacks last and which areas of your face are affected. The more details about your pain you can provide, the better.\nYour GP will consider other possible causes of your pain and may also examine your head and jaw to identify which parts are painful.\nAn important part of the process of diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia involves ruling out other conditions that can also cause facial pain.\nBy asking about your symptoms and carrying out an examination, your GP may be able to rule out other conditions, such as:\n\nmigraine\njoint pain in the lower jaw\ngiant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) \u2013 a condition in which medium and large arteries in the head and neck become inflamed and cause pain in the jaw and temples\na possible injury to one of the facial nerves\n\nYour medical, personal and family history will also need to be taken into consideration when determining possible causes of your pain.\nFor example, trigeminal neuralgia is less likely if you are under 40 years old, and\u00a0multiple sclerosis (MS)\u00a0may be more likely if you have a family history of the condition or if you have some other form of this condition. However, trigeminal neuralgia is very unlikely to be the first symptom of MS. \u00a0\nMRI scans\nIf your GP is not sure about your diagnosis, or if you have unusual symptoms, they may refer you for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0of your head.\nAn MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your head. It can help identify potential causes of your facial pain, such as\u00a0sinusitis (inflammation of the lining of the sinuses), tumours on one of the facial nerves, or nerve damage caused by MS.\nAn MRI can also sometimes detect whether a blood vessel in your head is compressing one of the trigeminal nerves, which is one of the main causes of trigeminal neuralgia. However, highly sophisticated MRI scans may be needed to show this accurately, although this may not necessarily be helpful, because not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve has trigeminal neuralgia.\n\n\nThere are a number of treatments available that can offer some relief from the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia.\nIdentifying triggers and avoiding them can also help.\nMost people with trigeminal neuralgia will be prescribed medication to help control their pain, although surgery may be considered for the longer term in those cases where medication is ineffective or causes too many side effects.\nAvoid triggers\nThe painful attacks associated with trigeminal neuralgia can sometimes be triggered or made worse by a number of different things. Therefore, in addition to your medical treatment, it may help to try to avoid these triggers, if possible.\nFor example, if your pain is triggered by wind or even a draught in a room, it may help to avoid sitting near open windows or the source of air conditioning, and wearing a scarf wrapped around your face in windy weather. A transparent dome-shaped umbrella can also protect your face from the weather.\nHot, spicy or cold food or drink may also trigger your pain, so avoiding these can help. Using a straw to drink warm or cold drinks may also help prevent the liquid coming into contact with the painful areas of your mouth. It is important to eat nourishing meals, however, so if you are having difficulty chewing, consider eating mushy foods or liquidising your meals.\u00a0\nCertain foods seem to trigger attacks in some people, so you may want to consider avoiding things such as caffeine, citrus fruits and bananas.\nMedication\nAs normal painkillers such as\u00a0paracetamol are not effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia, you will normally be prescribed an alternative medication, such as an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat\u00a0epilepsy) to help control your pain.\nThese medications were not originally designed to treat pain, but they can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain.\u00a0\nThey need to be taken regularly, not just when the pain attacks occur, but can be stopped when the episodes of pain cease and you are in remission.\u00a0 Unless otherwise instructed by your GP or specialist, it is important to build up the dosage slowly and reduce it again gradually over a few weeks. Taking too much too soon and stopping the medication too quickly can cause serious problems.\nInitially, your GP will probably prescribe a type of anticonvulsant called carbamazepine, although a number of alternatives are available if this is ineffective or unsuitable.\nThe anticonvulsant\u00a0carbamazepine is currently the only medication licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in the UK. It can be very effective initially, but may become less effective over time.\nYou will usually need to take this medicine at a low dose once or twice a day, with the dose slowly increasing up to four times a day until it provides satisfactory pain relief.\nCarbamazepine often causes side effects, which may make it difficult for some people to take. These include:\n\ntiredness and sleepiness\ndizziness (lightheadedness)\ndifficulty concentrating and memory problems\nconfusion\nfeeling unsteady on your feet\nfeeling sick and vomiting\ndouble vision\na reduced number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leukopenia)\nallergic skin reactions, such as\u00a0urticaria (hives)\n\nYou should speak to your GP if you experience any persistent or troublesome side effects while you are taking carbamazepine, especially allergic skin reactions, as these could be dangerous.\nCarbamazepine has also been linked to a number of less common but more serious side effects, including thoughts of\u00a0self-harm or suicide. You should immediately report any suicidal feelings to your GP. If this is not possible, call the NHS 24 111 service.\u00a0\nCarbamazepine may stop working over time. If this occurs, or if you experience significant side effects while taking it, you should be referred to a specialist to consider alternative medications or procedures.\nThere are a number of specialists you may be referred to for further treatment, including neurologists specialising in headaches, neurosurgeons and pain medicine specialists (for example, at a pain clinic).\nIn addition to carbamazepine, there are a number of other medications that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, including:\n\noxcarbazepine\nlamotrigine\ngabapentin\npregabalin\nbaclofen\u00a0\n\nNone of these medications are specifically licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, which means they have not undergone rigorous\u00a0clinical trials to determine whether they are effective and safe to treat the condition.\nHowever, this is largely only because trigeminal neuralgia is a rare condition, and clinical trials are difficult to carry out on such a painful condition because giving some people an inactive, \"dummy\" medication (placebo) to compare these medications to would be unethical and impractical.\nHowever, many specialists will prescribe an unlicensed medication if they think it is likely to be effective and the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks.\nIf your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication to treat trigeminal neuralgia, they should inform you that it is unlicensed and discuss possible risks and benefits with you.\nWith most of these medications, the side effects can be quite difficult to cope with initially. Not everyone experiences side effects, but if you do, try to persevere because they do tend to diminish with time or at least until the next dosage increase, when you may find a further period of adjustment is necessary. Talk to your GP if you are finding the side effects unbearable.\nSurgery and procedures\nIf medication does not adequately control your symptoms or is causing persistently troublesome side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss the different surgical and non-surgical options available to relieve your pain.\nThere a number of procedures that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, so you will need to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment with your specialist before making a decision. It is wise to be as informed as possible and to make the choice that it right for you as an individual.\nThere is no guarantee that one or any of these procedures will work for you but, once you have had a successful procedure, you won\u2019t need to take your pain medications unless the pain returns. If one procedure does not work, you can always try another or remain on your medication temporarily or permanently.\nSome of the procedures that can be used to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia are outlined below.\nThere are a number of procedures that can offer some relief from trigeminal neuralgia pain, at least temporarily, by inserting a needle or thin tube through the cheek and into the trigeminal nerve inside the skull.\nThese are known can \"percutaneous\" (through the skin) procedures, and they are carried out using\u00a0X-rays to guide the needle or tube into the correct place while you are heavily sedated with medication or under a\u00a0general anaesthetic (where you are asleep).\nPercutaneous procedures that can be carried out to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia include:\n\nglycerol injections \u2013 where a medication called glycerol in injected around the Gasserian ganglion (where the three main branches of the trigeminal nerve join together)\u00a0\nradiofrequency lesioning \u2013 where a needle is used to apply heat directly to the the Gasserian ganglion\u00a0\nballoon compression \u2013 where a tiny balloon is passed along a thin tube inserted through the cheek and is inflated around the Gasserian ganglion to squeeze it; the balloon is then removed\n\nThese procedures work by deliberately injuring or damaging the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to disrupt the pain signals travelling along it. You are usually able to go home the same day, following your treatment.\nOverall, all of these procedures are similarly effective in relieving trigeminal neuralgia pain, although there can be complications with each, and these vary with the procedure and the individual. The pain relief will usually only last a few years, and sometimes only a few months. Sometimes these procedures do not work at all.\nThe major side effect of these procedures is numbness of part or all the side of the face, and this can vary in severity from being very numb or just pins and needles. The sensation, which can be permanent, is often similar to that following an injection at the dentist. Very rarely, you can get a combination of numbness and continuous pain called anesthesia dolorosa, which is virtually untreatable.\nThe procedures also carry a risk of other short- and long-term side effects and complications, including bleeding, facial bruising, eye problems and problems moving the facial muscles.\nAn alternative way to relieve pain by damaging the trigeminal nerve that doesn't involve inserting anything through the skin is stereotactic radiosurgery. This is a fairly new treatment that uses a concentrated beam of radiation to deliberately damage the trigeminal nerve where it enters the brainstem.\nStereotactic radiosurgery does not require a\u00a0general anaesthetic and no cuts (incisions) are made in your cheek.\nA metal frame is attached to your head with four pins inserted around your scalp (a\u00a0local anaesthetic is used to numb the areas where these are inserted) and your head, complete with the frame attached, is held in a large machine for an hour or two (which may make you feel claustrophobic) while the radiation is given. The frame and pins are then removed, and you are able to go home after a short rest.\nIt can take a few weeks \u2013 or sometimes many months \u2013 for this procedure to take effect, but it can offer pain relief for some people for several months or years. Studies into this treatment have shown similar results to the other procedures mentioned above.\nThe most common complications associated with stereotactic radiosurgery include facial numbness and\u00a0pins and needles (paraesthesia) in the face. This can be permanent and, in some cases, very troublesome.\nMicrovascular decompression (MVD) is an operation that can help relieve trigeminal neuralgia pain without intentionally damaging the trigeminal nerve. Instead, the procedure involves relieving the pressure placed on the nerve by blood vessels that are touching the nerve or wrapped around it.\nThis is a major procedure that involves opening up the skull, and is carried out under general anaesthetic by a neurosurgeon.\nDuring MVD, the surgeon will make an incision in your scalp, behind your ear, and remove a small circular piece of skull bone. They will then either remove or relocate the blood vessel(s), separating them from the trigeminal nerve using an artificial pad or a sling constructed from adjoining tissue.\nFor many people, this type of surgery is effective in easing or completely stopping the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. It provides the longest lasting relief, with some studies suggesting that pain only recurs in about 30% of cases within 10-20 years of surgery.\u00a0 Currently, this is the closest possible cure for trigeminal neuralgia.\nHowever, it's an invasive procedure and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as facial numbness, hearing loss, stroke and even death (in around 1 in every 200 cases).\nMore information and support\nLiving with a long-term and painful condition such as trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult.\nYou may find it useful to contact local or national support groups, such as the Trigeminal Neuralgia Association UK, for more information and advice about living with the condition, and to get in touch with other people who have the condition to talk to them about their experiences.\nResearch has shown that groups that have support from health care professionals provide high-quality help, which can significantly improve your ability to manage this rare condition. Learning from others how to cope can help remove the fear of more pain and reduce the risk of depression.\nHowever, you need to be wary of potentially unreliable information you may find elsewhere, especially if offering \u201ccures\u201d for the condition. There is a great deal of misinformation on the internet, so do your research only on reliable websites, not on open forums or on social media.\nThere are a number of research projects running both in the UK and abroad to determine the cause of this condition and to find new treatments, including new medications, so there is always hope on the horizon.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.\nIt is a serious\u00a0condition, but can be cured with proper treatment.\nTB mainly affects the lungs. However, it can affect any part of the body, including the glands, bones and nervous system.\nSymptoms of TB\nTypical symptoms of TB include:\n\na persistent cough that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody\nweight loss\nnight sweats\nhigh temperature (fever)\ntiredness and fatigue\nloss of appetite\nnew swellings that haven't gone away after a few weeks\n\nYou should see a GP if you have a cough that lasts\u00a0more than three weeks or if you cough up blood.\nRead more about the\u00a0symptoms of TB\u00a0and\u00a0diagnosing TB\nWhat causes TB?\nTB is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nTB that affects the lungs is the most contagious type, but it\u00a0usually only spreads after\u00a0prolonged exposure to someone with the illness. For example,\u00a0it often spreads within a family who live in the same house.\nIn most healthy people, the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) kills the bacteria, and you have no symptoms.\nSometimes\u00a0the immune system cannot kill the bacteria, but manages to prevent it spreading in the body. This means you will not have any symptoms, but the bacteria will remain in your body. This is known as \"latent TB\".\u00a0\nIf\u00a0the immune system fails to kill or contain the infection, it can spread within the lungs or other parts of the body and symptoms will develop within a few weeks or months. This is known as \"active TB\".\nLatent TB could develop into an active TB infection at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened.\nRead more about the causes of TB\nWho is affected?\nBefore antibiotics were introduced, TB was a major health problem in the UK. Nowadays, the condition is much less common.\nHowever, in the last 20 years, TB cases have gradually increased, particularly among ethnic minority communities who are originally from countries where TB is more common.\nIn 2014, more than 6,500 cases of TB were reported in England. Of these, around 4,700 affected people who were born outside the UK.\nIt's estimated that around one-third of the world's population is infected with latent TB. Of these, up to 10% will become active at some point.\nHow TB is treated\nWith treatment, TB can usually be cured. Most people will need a course of antibiotics, usually for six months.\nSeveral different antibiotics are used. This is because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics. If you are infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with six or more different medications may be needed.\nIf you are in close contact with someone who has TB, tests may be carried out to see if you are also infected. These can include a chest X-ray,\u00a0blood tests, and a skin test called the Mantoux test.\nRead more about\u00a0treating TB\nTuberculosis vaccination\nThe\u00a0BCG\u00a0vaccine\u00a0can\u00a0provide effective protection against TB in up to\u00a08 out of 10\u00a0people\u00a0who are given it.\nCurrently, BCG vaccinations are only recommended for groups of people who are at a higher risk of developing TB.\nThis includes children living in areas with high rates of TB, or those who have close family members from countries with high TB rates, and\u00a0people under the age of 16\u00a0who are going to live and work with local people in an area with high rates of TB\u00a0for more than three months.\nIt's also recommended that some people, such as healthcare workers, are vaccinated\u00a0because of\u00a0the increased risk of contracting TB while working.\n\n\nThe symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) depend on where the infection occurs.\nTB usually develops slowly. Your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected.\nIn some cases the infection doesn't cause any symptoms, which is known as latent TB. It's called active TB if you have symptoms.\u00a0You should contact your GP if you or your child have symptoms of TB.\nRead about the causes of tuberculosis for more information about latent and active TB.\nMain symptoms\nGeneral symptoms of TB include:\n\nlack of appetite and weight loss\na high temperature (fever)\nnight sweats\nextreme tiredness or fatigue\n\nThese symptoms can have many different causes, however, and are not always a sign of TB.\nAdditional symptoms\nTB can also cause additional symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected.\nMost infections affect the lungs, which can cause:\n\na persistent cough\u00a0that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody\nbreathlessness\u00a0that gradually gets worse\n\nThis is known as pulmonary TB.\nLess commonly, TB infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the\u00a0nervous system (brain and nerves).\nThis is known as extrapulmonary TB.\nSymptoms of extrapulmonary TB vary, but can include:\n\npersistently\u00a0swollen glands\nabdominal (tummy) pain\npain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint\nconfusion\na persistent\u00a0headache\nseizures (fits)\n\nExtrapulmonary TB is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV.\n\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nThe condition is spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which\u00a0contain TB bacteria.\nAlthough it is spread in a similar way to a\u00a0cold or the\u00a0flu, TB is not as contagious. You would usually have to spend prolonged periods in close contact with an infected person to catch the infection yourself.\nFor example, TB infections usually spread between family members who live in the same house. It would be highly unlikely to become infected by sitting next to an infected person on a bus or train.\nNot everyone with TB is infectious. Generally, children with TB or people with TB that occurs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary TB) do not spread the infection.\nLatent or active TB\nIn most healthy people the immune system is able to destroy the bacteria that cause TB. However, in some cases the bacteria infect the body but don't cause any symptoms (latent TB), or the infection begins to cause symptoms within weeks or months (active TB).\nUp to 10% of people with latent TB eventually develop active TB years after the initial infection. This usually happens when the immune system is weakened\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, during chemotherapy.\nWho's most at risk?\nAnyone can catch TB, but people particularly at risk include those:\n\nwho live in, come from, or have spent time in a country or area with high levels of TB \u2013 around three in every four TB cases in the UK affect people born outside the UK\nin prolonged close contact with someone who is infected\nliving in crowded conditions\nwith a condition that weakens their immune system, such as HIV\nhaving treatments that weaken the immune system, such as corticosteroids, chemotherapy or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (used to treat some types of arthritis\u00a0and certain gut conditions)\nwho are very young or very old \u2013 the immune systems of people who are young or elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults\nin poor health or with a poor diet because of lifestyle and other problems, such as drug misuse, alcohol misuse, or homelessness\n\n\n\nSeveral tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), depending on the type of TB suspected.\nYour GP may refer you to a TB specialist for testing and treatment if they think you have TB.\nPulmonary TB\nA diagnosis of pulmonary TB (TB that affects the lungs) can be difficult and several tests are usually needed.\nThis will include a chest\u00a0X-ray to look for changes in the appearance of your lungs that are suggestive of TB. Samples of phlegm will also often be taken and checked for the presence of TB bacteria.\nThese tests are important in helping to\u00a0decide on\u00a0the most effective treatment for you.\nExtrapulmonary TB\nIf you have suspected extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs), several tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis. These may include:\n\na computerised tomography (CT) scan,\u00a0magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or\u00a0ultrasound scan\u00a0of the affected part of the body\nexamining the inside of your body with a\u00a0long, thin, flexible tube that contains a light and camera, which is inserted either through an opening such as your mouth (endoscopy) or a small cut made in your skin (laparoscopy)\nurine and blood tests\na biopsy \u2013 a small sample of tissue or fluid is taken from the affected area and tested for TB bacteria\n\nYou may also have a lumbar puncture. This involves taking a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the base of your spine. CSF is\u00a0fluid that surrounds the brain. It can be checked to see whether TB has infected your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).\nScreening for latent TB\nIn some circumstances, you may need to be tested to check for latent TB (when you have been infected with TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms).\nFor example, you may need to be screened if you have been in close contact with someone known to have an active TB infection (an infection that causes symptoms), or if you have recently spent time in a country where TB levels are high.\nIf you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common, you may be screened when you arrive or your GP may suggest screening when you register as a patient.\nThe Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB. It involves injecting a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of your forearm. It's also called the tuberculin skin test (TST).\nIf you have a latent TB infection, your skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test. If you have a very strong skin reaction, you may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether you have an active TB infection.\nIf you do not have a latent infection, your skin will not react to the Mantoux test. However, as TB can take a long time to develop, you may need to be screened again at a later stage.\nIf you have had the BCG vaccination, you may have a mild skin reaction to the Mantoux test. This does not necessarily mean you have latent TB.\nThe IGRA is a newer type of blood test for TB that is becoming more widely available.\nThe IGRA may be used to help diagnose latent TB:\n\nif you have a positive Mantoux test\nif you previously had the BCG vaccination (as the Mantoux test may not be reliable in these cases)\nas part of your TB screening if you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common\nas part of a health check when you register with a GP\nif you are about to have treatment that will suppress your immune system\nif you are a healthcare worker\n\n\n\nTreatment for tuberculosis (TB) will usually involve a long course of antibiotics lasting several months.\nWhile TB is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed.\nFor most people, a hospital admission during treatment is not necessary.\nPulmonary TB\nIf you\u2019re diagnosed with active pulmonary TB (TB that affects your lungs and causes symptoms), you will be given a six-month course of a combination of antibiotics. The usual course of treatment is:\n\ntwo antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for six months\ntwo additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first two months\n\nIt may be several weeks or months before you start to feel better. The exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your TB.\nAfter taking the medicine for two weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better. However, it is\u00a0important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics.\nTaking medication for six months is the most effective method of ensuring the TB bacteria are killed. If you stop taking your antibiotics before you complete the course, or\u00a0you skip a dose, the TB infection may become resistant to the antibiotics. This is potentially serious, as it can be difficult to treat and will require a longer course of treatment.\nIf you find it difficult to take your medication every day, your treatment team can work with you to find a solution. This may include having regular contact with your treatment team at home, the treatment clinic, or somewhere else that is more convenient.\nIf\u00a0treatment is completed correctly, you should not need any further checks by a TB specialist afterwards. However, you may be given advice about spotting signs that the illness has returned, although this is rare.\nIn\u00a0rare cases TB can be fatal, even with treatment. Death can occur if the lungs become too damaged to work properly.\nExtrapulmonary TB\nExtrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary TB. However, you may need to take them for 12 months.\nIf you have TB in areas such as your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed a\u00a0corticosteroid such as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. This will help to reduce any swelling in the affected areas.\nAs with pulmonary TB, it's important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course.\nLatent TB\nLatent TB is when you have been infected with the TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms of active disease. Treatment for latent TB is usually recommended for anyone aged 65 or under.\nHowever, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause liver damage in older adults, so treatment for people with latent TB aged 35-65 isn\u2019t recommended if this is a concern.\nLatent TB is also not always treated if it's thought to be drug-resistant. If this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection does not become active.\nIn some cases, testing and treatment for latent TB may be recommended for people who require treatment that will weaken their immune system, such as long-term corticosteroids, chemotherapy or TNF inhibitors. This is because there is a risk of the infection becoming active.\nTreatment for latent TB generally involves either taking a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for three months, or isoniazid on its own for six months.\nIsoniazid can cause nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), but you\u2019ll be given supplements of\u00a0vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) to take alongside it to reduce this risk. Your liver function may be tested before you start treatment.\nIn rare cases, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause eye damage, which can be serious. If you are going to be treated with ethambutol, your vision should also be tested at the beginning of the course of treatment.\nContact your TB treatment team if you develop any worrying symptoms during treatment, such as:\n\nbeing sick\u00a0\nyellowing of your skin and whites of your eyes (jaundice)\nan unexplained high temperature (fever)\ntingling or numbness in your hands or feet\na rash or itchy skin\nchanges to your vision, such as blurred vision\n\nRifampicin can reduce the effectiveness of\u00a0some types of contraception, such as the combined\u00a0contraceptive pill. Use an alternative method of contraception, such as condoms, while taking rifampicin.\nPreventing the spread of infection\nIf you are diagnosed with pulmonary TB,\u00a0you will be contagious up to about two to three weeks into your course of treatment.\nYou will not normally need to be isolated during this time, but it's important to take some basic precautions to stop TB spreading to your family and friends. You should:\n\nstay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it is safe to return\u00a0\nalways cover your mouth\u00a0\u2013\u00a0preferably with a disposable tissue\u00a0\u2013 when coughing, sneezing or laughing\ncarefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag\u00a0\nopen windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time\ndo not sleep in the same room as other people, as you could cough or sneeze in your sleep without realising it\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.\nThe hormone insulin \u2013 produced by the pancreas \u2013 is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood.\nThere are two main types of diabetes:\n\nType 1 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce any insulin\nType 2 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body\u2019s cells don't react to insulin\n\nThis topic is about type 1 diabetes.\nRead more about type 2 diabetes\nAnother type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth.\nIt's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated.\nYou should therefore visit your GP if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and losing weight unexpectedly (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).\nType 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1.\nIn type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) progressively reduces the amount of insulin (the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels) it produces until it stops producing any at all.\nIf the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body's organs.\nDiabetes symptoms\nThe symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose is high but isn\u2019t used by your muscles as fuel for energy.\nWhen blood glucose is high, glucose is lost in your urine and you may become dehydrated.\nTypical symptoms include:\n\nfeeling very thirsty\npassing urine more often than usual, particularly at night\nfeeling very tired all the time\nweight loss and loss of muscle bulk\npersistent infections such as thrush\n\nThe symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people (over a few hours or days). In adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few days or weeks).\nRead more about the symptoms of type 1 diabetes\nCauses of type 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them.\nWithout insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when the bloodstream becomes acidic, you develop dangerous levels of ketones in your blood stream and become severely dehydrated.\nThis results in the body being unable to produce insulin, which is required to move glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for energy. This is called Type 1 diabetes.\nRead more about the causes of type 1 diabetes\nTreating type 1 diabetes\nIt's important that diabetes is diagnosed as early as possible.\u00a0If left untreated, type-1 diabetes is a life-threatening condition. It's essential that treatment is started early.\nDiabetes can't be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life.\nIf you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll be referred to a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring.\nAs your body can't produce insulin, you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food (carbohydrate) you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do.\nInsulin injections come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. You'll most likely need a combination of different insulin preparations.\nInsulin is given to some patients by a continuous infusion of fast (rapid)\u00a0acting insulin (pump therapy). This is where a small device constantly pumps insulin (at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a plastic tube (cannula) that's inserted under the skin with a needle.\nThere are alternatives to insulin injections and pumps, but they're only suitable for a small number of patients. They are:\n\nislet cell transplantation \u2013 where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes\na complete pancreas transplant \u2013 this is still relatively rare and only a few centres of excellence offer this.\n\nRead more about diagnosing diabetes and treating type 1 diabetes\nComplications\nIf diabetes is left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.\nHaving a consistently\u00a0raised glucose level that doesn't cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.\nThere is also complications that can arise if your insulin is not balanced with your food intake and exercise. Your diabetes team will work with you to manage your insulin correctly.\nRead more about the complications of type 1 diabetes\nLiving with diabetes\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to look after your health very carefully. Caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications.\nFor example, eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly will lower your blood glucose level. Stopping smoking (if you smoke) will also reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\nYour healthcare team will discuss this with you, and you can see your own results through My Diabetes My Way. It's important that you learn the skills to self manage your diabetes and there are people to help and support you to do this.\nIf you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened\u00a0once a year.\nRead more about living with type 1 diabetes\n\n\nThe symptoms of type 1 diabetes should disappear when you start taking insulin and you get the condition under control.\nThe main symptoms of diabetes\u00a0are:\n\nfeeling very\u00a0thirsty\nurinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night\nfeeling very tired\nweight loss and loss of muscle bulk\nitchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush\u00a0(a yeast infection)\nblurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shape\n\nVomiting or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. This is a dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for treatment.\nWhen to seek urgent medical attention\nYou should seek urgent medical attention if you have diabetes and develop:\n\na loss of appetite\nnausea or vomiting\na high temperature\nstomach pain\nfruity smelling breath \u2013 which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish (some people can smell this themselves)\n\nHypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)\nIf you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels can become very low. This is known as hypoglycaemia (or a \"hypo\").\nIn most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink alcohol\u00a0on an empty stomach.\nSymptoms of a \"hypo\" include:\n\nfeeling shaky and irritable\nsweating\ntingling lips\nfeeling weak\nfeeling confused\nhunger\nnausea (feeling sick)\n\nA hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary.\nIf it isn't brought under control, a hypo can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness.\nIn this case, an emergency injection of a hormone called glucagon will be needed. Glucagon increases the glucose in your blood.\u00a0Your diabetes team will advise you in more detail about avoiding, recognising and treating a hypo.\nRead more about hypoglycaemia\nHyperglycaemia (high blood glucose)\nAs diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. This happens because there's insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy.\nIf your blood glucose levels become too high, you may experience hyperglycaemia. The symptoms of hyperglycaemia are similar to the main symptoms of diabetes, but they may come on suddenly and be more severe. They include:\n\nextreme thirst\na dry mouth\nblurred vision\ndrowsiness\na need to pass urine frequently\n\nLeft untreated or if you already have an infection, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a life-threatening\u00a0condition, where the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. This leads to a build-up of acids in your blood, which can cause vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness and even death.\nYour healthcare team will teach you about looking out for these symptoms and how to manage your 'Sick Day' rules.\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information about type 1\u00a0diabetes symptoms.\n\n\nType 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that's needed to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood.\nWhen you eat, your digestive system breaks down food and passes its nutrients \u2013 including glucose \u2013 into your bloodstream.\nThe pancreas (a small gland behind your stomach) usually produces insulin, which transfers any glucose out of your blood and into your cells, where it's converted to energy.\nHowever, if you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas is unable to produce any insulin (see below). This means that glucose can't be moved out of your bloodstream and into your cells.\nAutoimmune condition\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Your immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin.\nIt's not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection.\nType 1 diabetes is often inherited (runs in families), so the autoimmune reaction may also be genetic.\nIf you have a close relative \u2013 such as a parent, brother or sister \u2013 with type 1 diabetes, you have about a 6% chance of also developing the condition. The risk for people who don't have a close relative with type 1 diabetes is just under 0.5%.\nRead\u00a0about diagnosing type 1 diabetes\n\n\nIf you experience the symptoms of diabetes, you should visit your GP as soon as possible. They'll ask about your symptoms and may request a urine and blood test.\nUrine and blood tests\nYour urine sample will be tested to see whether it contains glucose. Urine doesn't usually contain glucose, but if you have diabetes, some glucose can overflow through the kidneys and into the urine. Your urine may also be tested for ketones (chemicals) that indicate type 1 diabetes.\nThe GP may do a finger prick blood test for glucose and ketones. A sample will be sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. These results will be discussed with the specialist diabetes service if there is concern you have Type 1 Diabetes.\nGlycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)\nThe glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test is another blood test that can be used to diagnose diabetes.nd to monitor our long-term diabetes control.\nIn people who've already been diagnosed with diabetes, the HbA1c test is often used to show how well their diabetes is being controlled.\nThe HbA1c test gives your average blood glucose level over the previous two to three months. The results can indicate whether the measures you're taking to control your diabetes are working.\nIf you've been diagnosed with diabetes, it's recommended that you have your HbA1c measured at least twice a year. However, you may need to have your HbA1c measured more frequently if:\n\nyou've recently been diagnosed with diabetes\nyour blood glucose remains too high\nyour treatment plan has been changed\nyou're planning a pregnancy\n\nUnlike other tests, the HbA1c test can be carried out at any time of day and doesn't require any special preparation, such as fasting. However, it's less reliable in certain situations, such as during pregnancy.\nThe advantages associated with the HbA1c test make it the preferred method of assessing how well blood glucose levels are being controlled in a person with diabetes.\nRead about treating type 1 diabetes\n\n\nMonitoring blood glucose\nAn important part of your treatment is to make sure that your blood glucose level is as normal and stable as possible.\nYou'll be able to manage this using insulin treatment and by eating a healthy, balanced diet, but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they're not too high or too low.\nExercise, illness, stress, drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, changes to your hormone levels during your monthly period can all affect your blood glucose levels.\nIn most cases, you'll need to check your blood glucose levels during the day, both at home and at work or school, using a simple finger prick blood test. You may need to do this up to four or more times a day, depending on the type of insulin treatment you're taking. There are different methods of checking your blood glucose that doesn't involve pricking your finger. Discuss your options with your diabetes care team.\nThe normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals. Mmol/l means millimoles per litre, and it's a way of defining the concentration of glucose in your blood.\nThere is another method to check glucose levels without pricking your finger. This is called a flash glucose monitor\u00a0(Freestyle Libre).\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information on testing your glucose levels.\nHaving your blood glucose levels checked\nYou'll be measuring your blood glucose yourself every day, to check your levels.\nYour GP or diabetes care team will also carry out a different blood test every two to six months, called the HbA1c test.\nThis gives a clearer idea of how well your treatment plan is working, by measuring how stable your glucose levels have been over the past 6-12 weeks.\nIt measures the amount of haemoglobin, which is the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it. A high HbA1c level may indicate that your blood glucose level is consistently high and that your diabetes treatment plan needs to be altered.\nThe ideal HbA1c target for people with diabetes is below 53 mmol/mol.\nTreating hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose)\nHypoglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose level becomes very low. It's likely that you'll develop hypoglycaemia from time to time.\nMild hypoglycaemia (or a \"hypo\") can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, and can be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary, such as:\n\n200ml pure fruit juice\n5 to 7 Dextrose tablets\n4 to 5 Glucotabs\n60ml Glucojuice\n5 jelly babies\n\nYou may also be able to take pure glucose, in the form of a tablet or fluid, if you need to control the symptoms of a hypo quickly.\nIf you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you can become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. If this occurs, you'll need assistance from another person who may be able to give you a glucose gel rubbed into your cheeks or an injection of glucagon into your muscle. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.\nYour diabetes care team may show several of your family members and close friends how to inject glucagon or give you glucose gel, should you need it.\nOnce you begin to come round, you'll need to eat something sugary when you're alert enough to do so. If you lose consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia, there's a risk that it could happen again within a few hours. You'll need to rest afterwards and have someone with you to ensure that you eat some food to replace the glucose stores in your body.\nIf the glucagon injection into your muscle doesn't work, and you're still drowsy or unconscious 10 minutes after the injection, you'll need urgent medical attention.\nYou'll need to have an injection of dextrose straight into a vein, which must be given by a trained healthcare professional.\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, it's recommended that you carry identification with you so that people are aware of the problem if you become hypoglycaemic.\nIf significant hypoglycaemia is a regular problem or you have lost your awareness of hypoglycaemia your health care team may consider using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).\nIslet cell transplantation\nSome people with type 1 diabetes may benefit from a fairly new procedure known as islet cell transplantation. It involves implanting healthy islet cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes.\nIn 2008, a government-funded islet cell transplant programme was introduced, and the procedure is now available through the NHS for people who satisfy certain criteria (see below).\nYou may be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you've had:\n\ntwo or more severe hypos within the last two years and you have a poor awareness of hypoglycaemia\na working kidney transplant, severe hypos and poor hypoglycaemia awareness, or poor blood glucose control even after receiving the best medical treatment\n\nYou may not be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you:\n\nweigh over 85kg (13st 5.4lb)\nhave poor kidney function\nneed a lot of insulin \u2013 for example, over 50 units a day for a 70kg (11st) person\n\nAn islet cell transplant is a minor, low-risk procedure that's carried out under local anaesthetic.\nThe procedure has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of severe hypos. So far, the results of islet cell transplants carried out in the UK have shown a significant reduction in the number of hypos, from 23 per person per year before transplantation to less than one per person per year afterwards.\nPancreas transplant\nPeople with type 1 diabetes who are having a kidney transplant from a donor may also be offered a pancreas transplant at the same time.\nOthers may be offered a pancreas transplant after they've had a kidney transplant because they\u2019re already on anti-rejection tablets.\nIf you're having repeated, severe and life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks, a pancreas transplant may also be recommended.\nDuring the procedure, your faulty pancreas will be replaced with a healthy pancreas from a donor. This will allow you to get a new source of insulin.\nPancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there's a risk of complications. In the UK, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list.\nThe waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there's a shortage of suitable donor organs.\nTreating high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia)\nHyperglycaemia can occur when your blood glucose levels become too high. It can happen for several reasons, such as eating too much, being unwell or not taking enough insulin.\nIf you develop hyperglycaemia, you may need to adjust your diet or your insulin dose to keep your glucose levels normal. Your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this.\nIf hyperglycaemia isn't treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood.\nDiabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death.\nThe signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include:\n\nfrequently passing urine\nthirst\ntiredness and lethargy (lack of energy)\nblurry vision\nabdominal (stomach) pain\nnausea and vomiting\ndeep breathing\nsmell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops)\ncollapse and unconsciousness\n\nRead more about the symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis\nYour healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you're unwell.\nIf you develop diabetic ketoacidosis, you'll need urgent hospital treatment. You'll be given insulin directly into a vein (intravenously). You may also need other fluids given by a drip if you're dehydrated, including salt solution and potassium.\nOther treatments\nType 1 diabetes can lead to long-term complications. If you have the condition, you have an increased risk of developing heart disease, stroke, eye\u00a0and kidney disease. To reduce the chance of this, you may be advised to take:\n\nanti-hypertensive medicines to control high blood pressure\na statin \u2013 such as simvastatin \u2013 to reduce high cholesterol levels\nlow-dose aspirin to prevent stroke\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor \u2013 such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease\n\nDiabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of a protein called albumin in your urine. It's often reversible if treated early enough.\nCare standards for diabetes\nThe aim of treating diabetes is to help people with the condition control their blood glucose levels and minimise the risk of developing future complications.\nIn Scotland there is a National Diabetes Improvement Plan produced by the Scottish Diabetes Group, patients and health care professionals.\u00a0\nThe Diabetes National Service Framework\u00a0has also been developed by diabetes clinical experts and patients with diabetes. Good diabetes care includes:\n\naccess to information and appropriate support for people with type 1 diabetes, including access to a structured education programme\nan agreed care plan, helping all people with diabetes to manage their care and lead a healthy lifestyle \u2013 including a named contact for their care\ninformation, care and support to enable all people with diabetes to control their blood glucose, maintain an acceptable blood pressure and minimise other risk factors for developing complications\naccess to services to identify and treat possible complications \u2013 such as screening for diabetic retinopathy (where high blood glucose levels damage the retina at the back of the eye) and specialised foot care\neffective care for all people with diabetes admitted to hospital, for whatever reason\n\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information about care from healthcare professionals. They highlight the 15 care essentials for patients with diabetes.\n\n\nIf diabetes isn't treated, it can lead to a number of different health problems. High glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.\nA consistently raised glucose level that doesn't cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the long term.\nHeart disease and stroke\nIf you have diabetes, you're up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.\nProlonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of developing atherosclerosis (furring and narrowing of your blood vessels).\nThis may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing angina (a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking). It also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become completely blocked, leading to a heart attack or stroke.\nNerve damage\nHigh blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels of your nerves. This can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. If the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation.\nRetinopathy\nRetinopathy\u00a0is where the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue) at the back of the eye is damaged. Blood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. This prevents the light from fully passing through to your retina. If it isn't treated, it can damage your vision.\nThe better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems. Having an annual eye check with a specialist (an ophthalmologist or optometrist) can help pick up signs of a potentially serious eye problem early so that it can be treated.\nTreatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.\nIf the condition hasn't reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended.\nThe main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:\n\nlaser treatment\ninjections of medication into your eyes\nan operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes\n\nRead about diabetic eye screening\nKidney disease\nIf the small blood vessels in your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.\nIn rare, severe cases, this can lead to kidney failure\u00a0and the need for dialysis (treatment to replicate the functions of the kidneys). In some cases, a kidney transplant may be necessary.\nFoot problems\nDamage to the nerves of the foot can mean that small nicks and cuts aren't noticed, which can lead to a foot ulcer developing. About 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause serious infection.\nIf you develop nerve damage, you should check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist. Look out for sores and cuts that don't heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have a foot examination at least once a year.\nRead more about foot care and diabetes\nSexual dysfunction\nIn men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication.\nWomen with diabetes may experience:\n\na reduced sex drive (loss of libido)\nreduced pleasure from sex\nvaginal dryness\na reduced ability to orgasm\npain during sex\n\nIf you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication, or you find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.\nMiscarriage and stillbirth\nPregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. If your blood glucose level isn't carefully controlled immediately before and during early pregnancy, there's also an increased risk of the baby developing a serious birth defect.\nPregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetes clinic. This allows doctors to keep a close eye on their blood glucose levels and control their insulin dosage more easily.\nRead more about diabetes and pregnancy:\n\nDiabetes UK\nMy Diabetes My Way\n\n\n\nLook after your feet\nHaving diabetes means that you're more likely to develop problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes. This is because blood glucose can damage the nerves in your feet.\nTo prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water. Wear shoes that fit properly and see a podiatrist or chiropodist (a foot care specialist) regularly so that any problems are detected early.\nRegularly check your feet for cuts, blisters\u00a0or grazes because you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged. See your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn't start to heal within a few days.\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information and advice about\u00a0taking care of your feet.\nRegular eye tests\nIf you have type 1 diabetes, you should be invited to have your your eyes screened at once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy.\nRetinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged. It can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long time (hyperglycaemia). If it isn't treated, retinopathy can eventually cause sight loss.\nRead more about\u00a0diabetic eye screening\nDiabetes sick day rules\nIf you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you're ill \u2013 known as your \"sick day rules\".\nContact your diabetes care team or GP for advice if you haven't received these.\nThe advice you're given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to:\n\nkeep taking your insulin \u2013 it's very important\u00a0not\u00a0to stop treatment when you're ill; your treatment plan may state whether you need to temporarily increase your dose\ntest your blood glucose level more often than usual \u2013 most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day\nkeep yourself well hydrated \u2013 make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks\nkeep eating \u2013 eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier\ncheck your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is high\n\nSeek advice from your diabetes care team or GP if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if:\n\nyou're not sure whether to make any changes to your treatment\nyou develop symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis\nyou have any other concerns\n\nRead more about\u00a0sick day rules\nPregnancy\nIf you have diabetes and you're thinking about having a baby, it's a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.\nA planned pregnancy enables you to make sure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as possible before you get pregnant.\u00a0Most women with diabetes have a healthy baby.\nYou'll need to keep your blood glucose under tight control, particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, to reduce the risk of the baby developing serious birth defects.\nYou should also take a higher dose of folic acid\u00a0tablets. Folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems. Doctors now recommend that all women planning to have a baby take folic acid. Women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg a day until they're 12 weeks pregnant (only available on prescription).\u00a0\nFolic acid should be taken alongside pregnancy multivitamins that include\u00a0vitamin D. Insulin and metformin are safe to take during pregnancy. It's important to review any other medications you take to ensure these are safe to take during pregnancy.\nYou should also have your eyes checked. Retinopathy (see above) affects the blood vessels in the eyes and is a risk for all people with diabetes. Pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, so it's important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant.\nYour GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice.\u00a0Diabetes UK\u00a0 and\u00a0JDRF\u00a0also provide more useful information about\u00a0pregnancy and diabetes\u00a0to help you get your pregnancy off to a healthy start.\nEducation\nYou'll be best equipped to manage your diabetes if you're given information and education when you're diagnosed, and then on an ongoing basis.\nThe\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u00a0strongly recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.\nThis gives people the best chance of developing the skills they need to effectively treat their condition, maintain their glucose levels at a normal level and help prevent long-term complications. It also reduces the risk of developing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose levels).\nStructured patient education\nStructured patient education means there's a planned course that:\n\ncovers all aspects of diabetes\nis flexible in content\nis relevant to a person\u2019s clinical and psychological needs\nis adaptable to a person\u2019s educational and cultural background\n\nThere are also several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education. Ask your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide.\nDiabetes and your child\nFor a parent whose child is diagnosed with a life-long condition, the job of parenting becomes even tougher.\nAlthough being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes will involve coming to terms with the diagnosis, getting used to treatment and making\u00a0changes to\u00a0everyday life, your child can still lead a normal and healthy life.\nThe\u00a0Diabetes UK\u00a0website has information and advice about\u00a0your child and diabetes.\nHelp and support\nMany people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes. Patient organisations have local groups where you can meet others who've been diagnosed with the condition.\nThe Diabetes UK website enables you to\u00a0find your local diabetes support group. If you want to contact a trained counsellor directly, you can phone Diabetes UK\u2019s care line on 0345 123 2399, or email\u00a0careline@diabetes.org.uk.\nThe\u00a0Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF)\u00a0also holds regular local events.\nFinancial support and benefits\nSome people with diabetes may be eligible to receive disability benefits and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their life.\nThe main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, elderly people, people with learning disabilities or mental health problems, and those with\u00a0complications of diabetes.\nPeople over 65 who are severely disabled, may qualify for a type of disability benefit called\u00a0Attendance Allowance.\nCarers may also be entitled to some benefit too, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes.\nStaff at your local\u00a0Citizen\u2019s Advice Bureau (CAB)\u00a0can check whether you're getting all of the benefits you're entitled to. Both they and your diabetes specialist nurse should also be able to give you advice about filling in the forms.\nGOV.uk\u00a0has more information about\u00a0benefits, and the\u00a0Diabetes UK\u00a0website has further advice about the\u00a0Disability Living Allowance (DLA).\nDriving with diabetes\nIt's a common myth that people with diabetes aren't allowed to drive anymore. Although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it's not as severe as you may think.\nYou should always tell your insurer that you are diabetic as this may affect your insurance claim. Only individuals who use insulin have to tell the DVLA that they have diabetes. A high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. This usually has to be renewed every 3 years.\nAdditional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g Group 2 HGV) so always refer to the\u00a0DVLA guidelines.\nUnfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos or being unable to recognise symptoms of a hypo (hypo unawareness).\nTo prevent hypos whilst driving you should\n\ncheck your blood glucose levels before driving\nkeep medication close by in the car\ntake regular breaks on long journeys over 2 hours\navoid missing meals\n\nFor more information about driving with diabetes, visit\u00a0Diabetes UK.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Diabetes is usually a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood glucose (sugar) level to become too high.\nThe hormone insulin \u2013 produced by the pancreas \u2013 is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood\nThere are two main types of diabetes:\n\ntype 1 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce any insulin\ntype 2 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body's cells don't react to insulin\n\nThis topic is about type 2 diabetes.\nRead more about type 1 diabetes\nAnother type of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear after birth.\nSymptoms of diabetes\nThe symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and isn't used as fuel for energy.\nYour body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine.\nTypical symptoms include:\n\nfeeling very thirsty\npassing urine more often than usual, particularly at night\nfeeling very tired\nweight loss and loss of muscle bulk\nslow to heal cuts or ulcers\nfrequent vaginal or penile thrush\nblurred vision\n\nRead more about the symptoms of type 2 diabetes\nIt's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible as it will get progressively worse if left untreated.\nCauses of type 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. This means glucose stays in the blood and isn't used as fuel for energy.\nType 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity and tends to be diagnosed in older people. Due to increased obesity, type 2 diabetes is now being seen in young people and all ages. It's far more common than type 1 diabetes.\nRead about the causes and risk factors for type 2 diabetes\nTreating type 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes is treated with changes in your diet and depending on the response of your blood glucose levels, sometimes tablets and insulin. Early in the course of type 2 diabetes, planned weight loss can even reverse the disease.\nRead more about the treatment of type 2 diabetes\nComplications of type 2 diabetes\nDiabetes can cause serious long-term health problems. It's the most common cause of vision loss and blindness in people of working age.\nEveryone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year for diabetic retinopathy.\nDiabetes is also responsible for most cases of kidney failure\u00a0and lower limb amputation, other than accidents.\nRead more about the complications of type 2 diabetes\nPreventing type 2 diabetes\nIf you're at risk of type 2 diabetes, you may be able to prevent it developing by making lifestyle changes.\nThese include:\n\nlosing weight if you're overweight, and maintaining a healthy weight\neating a healthy, balanced diet\nstopping smoking if you smoke\ndrinking alcohol in moderation\ntaking plenty of regular exercise\n\nLiving with type 2 diabetes\nIf you already have type 2 diabetes, it may be possible to control your symptoms by making the above changes. This also minimises your risk of developing complications.\nRead more about living with type 2 diabetes\n\n\nThe symptoms of diabetes include feeling very thirsty, passing more urine than usual, and feeling tired all the time.\nThe symptoms occur because some or all of the glucose stays in your blood and isn't used as fuel for energy. Your body tries to get rid of the excess glucose in your urine.\nThe main symptoms of\u00a0type 2 diabetes are:\n\nurinating more often than usual, particularly at night\nfeeling very thirsty\nfeeling very tired\nunexplained weight loss\nitchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush\u00a0(a yeast infection)\ncuts or wounds that heal slowly\nblurred vision \u2013 caused by the lens of the eye becoming dry\n\nThe signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes are usually obvious and develop very quickly, often over a few weeks.\nThese signs and symptoms aren't always as obvious, however, and it's often diagnosed during a routine check-up.\nThis is because they are often mild and develop gradually over a number of years. This means you may have type 2 diabetes for many years without realising it.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment for type 2 diabetes is very important as it may reduce your risk of developing complications later on.\nHyperglycaemia\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach, can't produce enough insulin to control your blood glucose level, or when the cells in your body don't respond properly to the insulin that is produced.\nThis means your blood glucose levels may become very high, and is known as hyperglycaemia.\nHyperglycaemia can occur for several reasons, including:\n\neating too much\nbeing unwell\nineffective diabetes medication\nnot taking enough medication\n\nHyperglycaemia causes the main symptoms of diabetes, which include extreme thirst and frequent urination.\n\n\nType 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood glucose level, or the body is unable to use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance).\nThe pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach that produces the hormone insulin. Insulin moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it's converted into energy.\nIn type 2 diabetes, there are several reasons why the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin.\nRisk factors for type 2 diabetes\nFour of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes are:\n\nage \u2013 being over the age of 40 (over 25 for south Asian people)\ngenetics \u2013 having a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister\nweight \u2013 being overweight or obese\nethnicity \u2013 being of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or black African origin, even if you were born in the UK\n\nYour risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. This may be because people tend to gain weight and exercise less as they get older.\nMaintaining a healthy weight by eating a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet\u00a0and\u00a0exercising regularly\u00a0are ways of preventing and managing diabetes.\nWhite people over the age of 40 have an increased risk of developing the condition. People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African descent have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes at a much earlier age.\nHowever, despite increasing age being a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, over recent years younger people from all ethnic groups have been developing the condition.\nIt's also becoming more common for children \u2013 as young as seven in some cases \u2013 to develop type 2 diabetes, mainly due to rising obesity levels.\nGenetics is one of the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a close relative such as a parent, brother or sister who has the condition.\nThe closer the relative, the greater the risk. A child who has a parent with type 2 diabetes has about a one in three chance of also developing the condition.\nYou're more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you're overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more.\nFat around your tummy (abdomen) particularly increases your risk. This is because it releases chemicals that can upset the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.\nThis increases your risk of developing a number of serious conditions, including\u00a0coronary heart disease,\u00a0stroke\u00a0and some types of\u00a0cancer.\nMeasuring your waist is a quick way of assessing your diabetes risk. This is a measure of abdominal\u00a0obesity, which is a particularly high-risk form of obesity.\nWomen have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their waist measures 80cm (31.5 inches) or more.\nAsian men with a waist size of 89cm (35 inches) or more have a higher risk, as do white or black men with a waist size of 94cm (37 inches) or more.\nExercising regularly and reducing your body weight by about 5% could reduce your risk of getting diabetes by more than 50%.\nRead about\u00a0measuring your waist size\nPeople of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African origin are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes is up to six times more common in south Asian communities than in the general UK population, and it's three times more common among people of African and African-Caribbean origin.\nPeople of south Asian and African-Caribbean origin also have an increased risk of developing\u00a0complications of type 2 diabetes, such as heart disease, at a younger age than the rest of the population.\nOther risks\nYour risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also increased if your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes.\nThis is sometimes called pre-diabetes, and doctors sometimes call it impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Pre-diabetes is reversible if you lose weight. Discuss your options with your GP.\nPre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if you don't take preventative steps, such as making lifestyle changes. These include\u00a0eating healthily,\u00a0losing weight\u00a0if you're overweight, and taking plenty of\u00a0regular exercise.\nWomen who have had gestational diabetes during pregnancy also have a greater risk of developing diabetes in later life.\n\n\nMedicines for type 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes is a progressive condition and\u00a0usually gets worse over time. Making lifestyle changes, such as adjusting your diet and taking more exercise, may help you control your blood glucose levels at first, but may not be enough in the long term.\nYou may eventually need to take medication to help control your blood glucose levels.\nInitially, this will usually be in the form of tablets and can sometimes be a combination of more than one type of tablet. It may also include insulin or another medication that you inject.\nMetformin\nMetformin is usually the first medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases into your bloodstream. It also makes your body's cells more responsive to insulin.\nIf you're overweight, it's also likely you'll be prescribed metformin. Unlike some other medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, metformin shouldn't cause additional weight gain.\nHowever, it can sometimes cause mild side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea, and you may not be able to take it if you have kidney damage.\nSGLT2 inhibitors\nSGLT2 inhibitors work by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in urine. They're particularly useful in people with type 2 diabetes and who have cardiac disease.\nThe three SGLT2 inhibitors that may be prescribed include:\n\ndapagliflozin\ncanagliflozin\nempagliflozin\n\nEach medication is taken as a tablet once a day. The main side effect is a higher risk of genital and urinary tract infections.\nIf you're unwell and have a dehydrating illness (e.g. fever, vomiting or diarrhoea), it's important you stop these medications. Get your glucose and ketone level checked by your healthcare professional to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis developing.\nGLP-1 agonists\nGLP-1 agonists acts in a similar way to the natural hormone GLP-1 (see the section on gliptins, below).\nThey're given by injection and boost your own\u00a0insulin production when there are high blood glucose levels, reducing blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycaemia episodes (\"hypos\"). They're also particularly useful for people with type 2 diabetes and cardiac disease.\nSulphonylureas\nSulphonylureas increase the amount of insulin that's produced by your pancreas.\nExamples include:\n\nglibenclamide\ngliclazide\nglimepiride\nglipizide\ngliquidone\n\nYou may be prescribed one of these medicines if you can't take metformin.\nAlternatively, you may be prescribed sulphonylurea and metformin if metformin doesn't control blood glucose on its own.\nSulphonylureas can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) because they increase the amount of insulin in your body. They can sometimes cause side effects, including weight gain, nausea and diarrhoea.\nPioglitazone\nPioglitazone is a type of thiazolidinedione medicine (TZD), which make your body's cells more sensitive to insulin so more glucose is taken from your blood.\nIt's usually used in combination with other oral diabetes medication. It may cause weight gain and ankle swelling (oedema).\nYou shouldn't take pioglitazone if you have heart failure or a high risk of bone fracture.\nGliptins (DPP-4 inhibitors)\nGliptins work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring hormone called GLP-1.\nGLP-1 helps the body produce insulin in response to high blood glucose levels, but is rapidly broken down.\nBy preventing this breakdown, the gliptins (linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) prevent high blood glucose levels, but don't result in episodes of hypoglycaemia.\nYou may be prescribed a gliptin if you're unable to take sulphonylureas or glitazones, or in combination with them. They're not associated with weight gain\u00a0and are often used with other oral diabetes medication for those who are obese.\nInsulin treatment\nIf glucose-lowering tablets aren't effective in controlling your blood glucose levels, you may need to have insulin treatment.\nThis can be taken instead of or alongside your tablets, depending on the dose and the way you take it.\nInsulin comes in several different preparations, and each works slightly differently.\u00a0Your treatment may include a combination of these different insulin preparations.\nInsulin injections\nInsulin must be injected because it would be broken down in your stomach like food and unable to enter your bloodstream if it were taken as a tablet.\nIf you need to inject insulin, your diabetes care team will advise you about when you need to do it.\nThey will show you how to inject it yourself, and will also give you advice about storing your insulin and disposing of your needles properly.\nInsulin injections are given using either a syringe or an injection pen, also called an insulin pen (auto-injector). Most people need between two and four injections of insulin a day.\nYour GP practice\u00a0or diabetes nurse will also teach a relative or a close friend how to inject the insulin properly.\nYou can read more about insulin and how to inject it on the Diabetes UK website.\nTreatment for low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia)\nIf you have type 2 diabetes that's controlled using insulin or certain types of tablets (e.g. sulfonylurea), you may experience episodes of hypoglycaemia.\nHypoglycaemia is where your blood glucose levels become very low.\nMild hypoglycaemia (a \"hypo\") can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, but it can usually be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary.\nIf you have a hypo, you should initially have a form of carbohydrate that will act quickly, such as a sugary drink or glucose tablets.\nThis should be followed by a longer-acting carbohydrate, such as a cereal bar, sandwich or piece of fruit.\nIn most cases, these measures will be enough to raise your blood glucose level to normal. You should aim for a hypo to be treated and to recheck your blood glucose level within 15 minutes.\nIf blood glucose still less than 4mmol/l then repeat the treatment using a fast acting carbohydrate. When your blood glucose returns to normal then have your longer acting carbohydrate.\nIf you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you may become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness.\nIf this occurs, you may need to have an injection of glucagon into your muscle or glucose into a vein. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels.\nYou may require input from a health care professional. If the glucagon is not successful, you may require an injection of dextrose into your vein.\nYour diabetes care team can advise you on how to avoid a hypo and what to do if you have one.\nOther treatments\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your risk of developing heart disease, stroke, foot problems, eye\u00a0and kidney disease is increased.\nTo reduce your risk of developing other serious health conditions, you may be advised to take other medicines, including:\n\nanti-hypertensive medicines to control high blood pressure\na statin, such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, to reduce high cholesterol\nlow-dose aspirin to prevent a stroke\nan angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril, if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease\n\nDiabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of albumin (a protein) in your urine. If treated early enough, it may be reversible.\nMonitoring blood glucose levels\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, your GP or diabetes care team will need to take a reading of your blood glucose level about every two to six months.\nThis will show how stable your glucose levels have been in the recent past and how well your treatment plan is working.\nThe HbA1c test is used to measure blood glucose levels over the previous two to three months.\nHbA1c is a form of haemoglobin, the chemical that carries oxygen in red blood cells, which also has glucose attached to it.\nA high HbA1c level means that your blood glucose level has been consistently high over recent weeks, and your diabetes treatment plan may need to be changed.\nYour diabetes care team can help you set a target HbA1c level to aim for. This will usually be less than 53 mmol/mol (7%) or individualised as agreed with your diabetes team.\nRead more about the HbA1c test\nMonitoring your own blood glucose\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, as well as having your blood glucose level checked by a healthcare professional every two to six months, you may be advised to monitor your own blood glucose levels at home.\nEven if you have a healthy diet and are taking tablets or using insulin therapy, exercise, illness and stress can affect your blood glucose levels.\nOther factors that may affect your blood glucose levels include drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle.\nA blood glucose meter is a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. It can be useful for detecting high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) or low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia).\nIf blood glucose monitoring is recommended, you should be trained in how to use a blood glucose meter and what you should do if the reading is too high or too low.\nBlood glucose meters aren't currently available for free on the NHS but, in some cases, blood monitoring strips may be. Ask a member of your diabetes care team if you're unsure.\nDiabetes UK also provides further information about the availability of blood glucose test strips.\nRegularly monitoring your blood glucose levels will ensure your blood glucose is as normal and stable as possible.\nAs your blood glucose level is likely to vary throughout the day, you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you're taking.\nIn home testing, blood glucose levels are usually measured by how many millimoles of glucose are in a litre of blood.\nA millimole is a measurement used to define the concentration of glucose in your blood. The measurement is expressed as millimoles per litre, or mmol/l for short.\nA normal blood glucose level is 4-7 mmol/l before meals (preprandial) and less than 8.5 mmol/l two hours after meals (postprandial), although this can vary from person to person.\nYour diabetes care team can discuss your blood glucose level with you in more detail. It's important to know your individual targets.\n\n\nIf diabetes isn't treated, it can lead to a number of other health problems.\nHigh glucose levels can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs.\nEven a mildly raised glucose level that doesn't cause any symptoms can have long-term damaging effects.\nHeart disease and stroke\nIf you have diabetes, you're up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.\nProlonged, poorly controlled blood glucose levels increase the likelihood of atherosclerosis, where the blood vessels become clogged up and narrowed by fatty substances.\nThis may result in a poor blood supply to your heart or to your lower limbs, causing angina (a dull, heavy or tight pain in the chest) or claudication (pain in the back of your calves when walking).\nIt also increases the chance that a blood vessel in your heart or brain will become blocked, leading to a heart attack or stroke.\nNerve damage\nHigh blood glucose levels can damage the tiny blood vessels in your nerves.\nThis can cause a tingling or burning pain that spreads from your fingers and toes up through your limbs. It can also cause numbness, which can lead to ulceration of the feet.\nDamage to the peripheral nervous system, which includes all parts of the nervous system that lie outside the central nervous system, is known as peripheral neuropathy.\nIf the nerves in your digestive system are affected, you may experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea\u00a0or constipation.\nDiabetic retinopathy\nDiabetic retinopathy\u00a0is when the retina, the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, becomes damaged.\nBlood vessels in the retina can become blocked or leaky, or can grow haphazardly. This prevents light fully passing through to your retina. If it isn't treated, it can damage your vision.\nAnnual eye checks are usually organised by a regional photographic unit. If significant damage is detected, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (ophthalmologist) such as cataract and glaucoma.\nThe better you control your blood glucose levels, the lower your risk of developing serious eye problems.\nTreatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.\nIf the condition hasn't reached this stage, the advice on managing your diabetes, BP and cholesterol level is recommended.\nThe main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:\n\nlaser treatment\ninjections of medication into your eyes\nan operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes\n\nRead about diabetic eye screening.\nKidney disease\nIf the small blood vessels of your kidney become blocked and leaky, your kidneys will work less efficiently.\nIt's usually associated with high blood pressure, and treating this is a key part of management.\nIn rare, severe cases, kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. This can mean a kidney replacement, treatment with dialysis or sometimes kidney transplantation becomes necessary.\nFoot problems\nDamage to the nerves of the foot can mean small nicks and cuts aren't noticed and this, in combination with poor circulation, can lead to a foot ulcer.\nAbout 1 in 10 people with diabetes get a foot ulcer, which can cause a serious infection.\nIf you have diabetes, look out for sores and cuts that don't heal, puffiness or swelling, and skin that feels hot to the touch. You should also have your feet examined at least once a year.\nIf poor circulation or nerve damage is detected, check your feet every day and report any changes to your doctor, nurse or podiatrist.\nSexual dysfunction\nIn men with diabetes, particularly those who smoke, nerve and blood vessel damage can lead to erection problems. This can usually be treated with medication.\nWomen with diabetes may experience:\n\na reduced sex drive (loss of libido)\nless pleasure from sex\nvaginal dryness\nless ability to orgasm\npain during sex\n\nIf you experience a lack of vaginal lubrication or find sex painful, you can use a vaginal lubricant or a water-based gel.\nMiscarriage and stillbirth\nPregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.\nIf your blood glucose level isn't carefully controlled during the early stages of pregnancy, there's also an increased risk of the baby developing a birth defect.\nPregnant women with diabetes will usually have their antenatal check-ups in hospital or a diabetic clinic, ideally with a doctor who specialises in pregnancy care (an obstetrician).\nThis will allow your care team to keep a close eye on your blood glucose levels and control your insulin dosage more easily, as well as monitoring the growth and development of your baby.\nThe Diabetes UK website has more information about diabetes complications.\nLooking after your eyes\nThe NHS diabetic eye screening programme will arrange for you to have your eyes checked every year.\nEveryone who is on a diabetes register will be given the opportunity to have a digital picture taken of the back of their eye. Speak to your GP to register.\n\n\nLook after your feet\nIf you have diabetes, you're at greater risk of developing problems with your feet, including foot ulcers and infections from minor cuts and grazes.\nThis is because diabetes is associated with poor blood circulation in the feet, and blood glucose can damage the nerves.\nTo prevent problems with your feet, keep your nails short and wash your feet daily using warm water.\nWear shoes that fit properly, and see foot care specialists (a podiatrist or chiropodist) regularly so any problems can be detected early.\nRegularly check your feet for cuts, blisters or grazes as you may not be able to feel them if the nerves in your feet are damaged.\nSee your GP if you have a minor foot injury that doesn't start to heal within a few days.\nRegular eye tests\nIf you have type 2 diabetes, you should be invited to have your eyes screened once a year to check for diabetic retinopathy.\nDiabetic retinopathy is an eye condition where the small blood vessels in your eye become damaged.\nIt can occur if your blood glucose level is too high for a long period of time (hyperglycaemia). Left untreated, retinopathy can eventually lead to sight loss.\nRead more about diabetic eye screening\nPeople with diabetes should also see their optician every two years for a regular eye test. Diabetic eye screening is specifically for diabetic retinopathy and can't be relied upon for other conditions.\nPregnancy\nIf you have diabetes and you're thinking about having a baby, it's a good idea to discuss this with your diabetes care team.\nIf you're taking oral medications to manage your diabetes, this may need to change before you are pregnant. It's important that you plan your pregnancy and discuss it with your diabetes team.\nPlanning your pregnancy means you can ensure your blood glucose levels are as well controlled as they can be before you get pregnant.\nYou'll need to tightly control your blood glucose level \u2013 particularly before becoming pregnant and during the first eight weeks of your baby's development \u2013 to reduce the risk of birth defects.\nYou should also:\n\ncheck your medications \u2013 some tablets used to treat type 2 diabetes may harm your baby, so you may have to switch to insulin injections, stop statin medication or some blood pressure medications\ntake a higher dose of folic acid tablets \u2013 folic acid helps prevent your baby developing spinal cord problems, and it's recommended all women planning to have a baby take folic acid; women with diabetes are advised to take 5mg each day (only available on prescription) along with pregnancy multivitamins that include vitamin D\nhave your eyes checked \u2013 retinopathy, which affects the blood vessels in the eyes, is a risk for all people with diabetes; as pregnancy can place extra pressure on the small vessels in your eyes, it's important to treat retinopathy before you become pregnant\n\nYour GP or diabetes care team can give you further advice.\nDiabetes education\nYou'll be best equipped to manage your diabetes day-to-day if you're given information and education when you're diagnosed and on an ongoing basis.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that all people who have diabetes should be offered a structured patient education programme, providing information and education to help them care for themselves.\nStructured patient education\nStructured patient education means there's a planned course that:\n\ncovers all aspects of diabetes\nis flexible in content\nis relevant to a person's clinical and psychological needs\nis adaptable to a person's educational and cultural background\n\nFor type 2 diabetes, there are several local adult education programmes, many of which are working towards the criteria for structured education.\nAsk your diabetes care team about the adult education programmes they provide.\nTalk to others\nMany people find it helpful to talk to others in a similar position, and you may find support from a group for people with diabetes.\nPatient organisations have local groups where you can meet others diagnosed with the condition. To find your local diabetes support group, visit Diabetes UK.\nIf you want to get in touch with a trained counsellor directly, you can call the Diabetes UK Helpline on 0345 123 2399 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 7pm) or email helpline@diabetes.org.uk\nFinancial support and benefits\nSome people with diabetes may be eligible for disability and incapacity benefits, depending on the impact the condition has on their lives.\nThe main groups likely to qualify for welfare benefits are children, the elderly, and those with learning disabilities, mental health difficulties or diabetes complications.\nPeople over the age of 65 who are severely disabled may qualify for a type of disability benefit called Attendance Allowance.\nCarers may also be entitled to some benefits, depending on their involvement in caring for the person with diabetes.\nYour local Citizens Advice can check whether you're getting all the benefits you're entitled to. Your diabetes specialist nurse and Citizens Advice can also provide advice about filling in the forms.\nDriving with diabetes\nIt's a common myth that people with diabetes aren't allowed to drive anymore. Although there are some restrictions on drivers with diabetes, it's not as severe as you may think.\nYou should always tell your insurer that you have diabetes as this may affect your insurance claim. Only individuals who use insulin have to tell the DVLA that they have diabetes. A high majority of individuals who use insulin can carry on driving on a restricted licence. This usually has to be renewed every 3 years.\nAdditional restictions may apply for different licences (e.g Group 2 HGV) so always refer to the DVLA guidelines.\nUnfortunately, some individuals do lose their driving license, most commonly due to experiencing severe hypos.\nIf you start to have a hypo whilst driving you should:\n\nPull over safely\nSwitch off your car engine\nTake fast-acting carbs, like glucose tablets or sweets, and some longer-acting carbohydrates too, like plain biscuits or crackers\nDon\u2019t drive until 45 minutes after your blood sugar level has gone back to 5mmol/l or above\n\nFor more information about driving with diabetes, visit Diabetes UK.\nDiabetes sick day rules\nIf you need to take insulin to control your diabetes, you should have received instructions about looking after yourself when you're ill \u2013 known as your \"sick day rules\".\nContact your diabetes care team or GP for advice if you haven't received these.\nThe advice you're given will be specific to you, but some general measures that your sick day rules may include could be to:\n\nkeep taking your insulin \u2013 it's very important not to stop treatment when you're ill; your treatment plan may state whether you need to temporarily increase your dose\ntest your blood glucose level more often than usual \u2013 most people are advised to check the level at least four times a day\nkeep yourself well hydrated \u2013 make sure you drink plenty of sugar-free drinks\nkeep eating \u2013 eat solid food if you feel well enough to, or liquid carbohydrates such as milk, soup and yoghurt if this is easier\ncheck your ketone levels if your blood glucose level is high\n\nSeek advice from your diabetes care team or GP if your blood glucose or ketone level remains high after taking insulin, if:\n\nyou're not sure whether to make any changes to your treatment\nyou develop symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis\nyou have any other concerns\n\nTelecare Self-Check online tool\nVisit the Telecare Self-Check online tool to find the right support for you in your area.\u00a0This easy to use online tool allows you to find helpful information on telecare services that could help you live independently at home for longer.\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) is where your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones.\nCommon signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed.\nAn underactive thyroid can often be successfully\u00a0treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones\u00a0your thyroid isn't making.\nThere's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. Most cases are caused either by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it,\u00a0or\u00a0by damage to the thyroid that occurs during some treatments for an overactive thyroid\u00a0or\u00a0thyroid cancer.\nRead more about the causes\u00a0of an underactive thyroid\nWhen to see your GP\nSymptoms of an underactive thyroid\u00a0are often similar to those of other conditions,\u00a0and they\u00a0usually develop slowly, so you may not notice them for years.\nYou should see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid if you have\u00a0symptoms including:\n\ntiredness\nweight gain\ndepression\u00a0\nbeing sensitive to\u00a0the cold\ndry skin and hair\nmuscle aches\n\nThe only accurate way of finding out whether you have a thyroid problem is to have\u00a0a\u00a0thyroid function test, where a sample of blood is tested to measure your\u00a0hormone levels.\nRead\u00a0more about testing for an underactive thyroid\nWho's affected\nBoth men and women can have an underactive thyroid, although\u00a0it's more common\u00a0in women. In the UK, it affects 15 in every 1,000 women and\u00a01 in 1,000 men. Children can also develop an underactive thyroid.\nAround 1 in 3,500-4,000 babies\u00a0are born with an\u00a0underactive thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism).\u00a0All babies born in the UK are screened for congenital hypothyroidism\u00a0using a\u00a0blood spot test when the baby is about five days old.\nTreating an underactive thyroid\nTreatment for an underactive thyroid involves taking daily\u00a0hormone replacement tablets, called levothyroxine,\u00a0to raise your\u00a0thyroxine levels. You'll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. However, with proper treatment, you should be able to lead a normal, healthy life.\nIf an underactive thyroid isn't treated, it can lead to complications, including heart disease,\u00a0goitre, pregnancy problems and a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare).\nRead more about treating an underactive thyroid\u00a0and the complications of an underactive thyroid\n\n\nMany symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions, so it can easily be confused for something else.\nSymptoms\u00a0usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years.\nCommon symptoms include:\n\ntiredness\nbeing sensitive to cold\nweight gain\nconstipation\ndepression\nslow movements and thoughts\nmuscle aches and weakness\nmuscle cramps\ndry and scaly skin\nbrittle hair and nails\nloss of libido (sex drive)\npain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome)\nirregular periods\u00a0or heavy periods\n\nElderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start\u00a0puberty earlier than normal.\nIf you have any of these symptoms, see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid.\nRead more about getting tested for an underactive thyroid\nIf an underactive thyroid isn't treated\nIt's unlikely that you'd have many of the later symptoms of an underactive thyroid, because the condition is often identified before more serious symptoms appear.\nLater symptoms of an underactive thyroid\u00a0include:\n\na low-pitched and hoarse voice\na puffy-looking face\nthinned or partly missing eyebrows\na slow heart rate\nhearing loss\nanaemia\n\n\n\nAn underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4).\nMost cases of an underactive thyroid are caused by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it, or by damage that occurs as a result of\u00a0treatments for\u00a0thyroid cancer or an overactive thyroid.\nImmune system\nAn underactive thyroid often occurs when the immune system, which usually fights infection, attacks the thyroid gland. This damages the thyroid, which means it's not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine,\u00a0leading to the symptoms of an underactive thyroid.\nA condition called Hashimoto's disease is the most common type of autoimmune reaction\u00a0that\u00a0causes an underactive thyroid.\nIt's not clear what causes Hashimoto\u2019s disease, but it runs in families. It's also common in people with another immune system disorder, such as type 1 diabetes and vitiligo.\nPrevious thyroid treatment\nAn underactive thyroid can also occur as a side effect or complication of previous treatment to the thyroid gland, such as surgery or a treatment called radioactive iodine therapy.\nThese treatments are sometimes used for an overactive thyroid\u00a0(where the thyroid gland\u00a0produces too much hormone) or thyroid cancer.\nLess common causes\nWorldwide,\u00a0a\u00a0lack of dietary\u00a0iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. However, iodine deficiency is\u00a0uncommon in the UK.\nBabies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland doesn't develop properly in the womb. This is called congenital hypothyroidism and is\u00a0uncommon, affecting around 1 in 3,000 babies. It's\u00a0usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth.\nA problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid.\u00a0The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and\u00a0regulates the thyroid. Therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid.\nAn underactive thyroid has also been linked to\u00a0some viral infections or some\u00a0medications used to treat other conditions, such as:\n\nlithium \u2013 a medication sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, including depression\u00a0and\u00a0bipolar disorder\namiodarone \u2013 a medication sometimes used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)\ninterferons \u2013 a class of medication sometimes used to treat certain types of\u00a0cancer and hepatitis C\n\nSpeak to your GP or specialist if you're concerned that a medication you're taking may be affecting your thyroid hormone levels.\n\n\nIt's very important that an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is diagnosed as soon as possible.\nLow levels of thyroid-producing hormones, such as\u00a0triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), can change the way the body processes fat.\nThis can cause\u00a0high cholesterol and atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries), which can potentially lead to serious heart-related problems, such as\u00a0angina and heart attack.\nTherefore, you should see your GP and ask for a\u00a0blood test\u00a0if you repeatedly have symptoms of an underactive thyroid.\nThyroid function test\nA\u00a0blood test measuring your hormone levels is the only accurate way to find out whether\u00a0there's a problem.\nThe test, called a thyroid function test, looks at levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) in the blood.\nA\u00a0high level of TSH and a low level of\u00a0T4 in the blood\u00a0could mean you have\u00a0an underactive thyroid.\nIf your test results show raised TSH but normal\u00a0T4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future.\nYour GP may recommend that you have a repeat blood test every so often to see whether you eventually develop an underactive thyroid.\nBlood tests are also sometimes used for other measurements, such as checking the level of a hormone called\u00a0triiodothyronine (T3). However, this isn't routine, because T3 levels can often remain normal, even if you have a significantly underactive thyroid.\nThe\u00a0Lab Tests Online UK\u00a0website has more information about the different types of thyroid function tests.\nReferral\nYour GP may refer you to an endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone disorders) if you:\n\nare younger than 16\nare pregnant or trying to get pregnant\nhave just given birth\nhave another health condition, such as heart disease, which may complicate your medication\nare taking a medication known to cause a reduction in thyroid hormones, such as amiodarone or lithium\n\n\n\nAn underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine.\nLevothyroxine\u00a0replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid doesn't make enough of.\nYou'll initially have regular\u00a0blood tests until the correct dose\u00a0of levothyroxine is reached. This\u00a0can take a little while to get right.\nYou may start on a low dose of levothyroxine, which may be increased gradually, depending on how your body responds.\u00a0Some people start to feel better\u00a0soon after beginning treatment,\u00a0while others\u00a0don't notice an improvement in their symptoms for several months\nOnce you're taking the correct dose, you'll usually have a blood test once a year to monitor your hormone levels.\nIf\u00a0blood tests suggest you may have an underactive thyroid, but you don't have any symptoms or they're very mild, you may not need any treatment. In these cases, your GP will usually monitor your hormone levels every few months and prescribe levothyroxine if you develop symptoms.\nTaking levothyroxine\nIf you're prescribed levothyroxine, you should take one tablet at the same time every day.\u00a0It's usually recommended that you take the tablets in the morning, although some people prefer to take them at night.\nThe effectiveness of the\u00a0tablets can be altered by other medications, supplements or foods, so they should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach, and you should avoid eating for 30 minutes afterwards.\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, if this is within a few hours of your usual time. If you don't remember until later than this, skip the dose and take the next dose at the usual time, unless\u00a0advised otherwise by your doctor.\nAn underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, so you'll usually need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life.\nIf you're prescribed levothyroxine because you have an underactive thyroid, you're entitled to a medical exemption certificate. This means you don't have to pay for your prescriptions.\u00a0\nLevothyroxine doesn't usually have any side effects, because the tablets simply replace a missing hormone.\nSide effects usually only occur if you're taking too much levothyroxine. This can cause problems including\u00a0sweating, chest pain, headaches, diarrhoea and vomiting.\nTell your doctor if you develop new symptoms while taking levothyroxine. You should also let them know if your symptoms get worse or don't improve.\nCombination therapy\nIn the UK, combination therapy \u2013 using levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3) together \u2013 isn't routinely used because there's insufficient evidence to show it\u2019s better than using levothyroxine alone (monotherapy).\nIn most cases,\u00a0suppressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using high dose thyroid replacement therapy should be avoided because it carries a risk of causing adverse side effects, such as\u00a0atrial fibrillation (an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate), strokes, osteoporosis and fracture.\nHowever, this type of treatment may sometimes be recommended in cases where a person has a history of\u00a0thyroid cancer and there\u2019s a significant risk of it reoccurring.\n\n\nSeveral complications can occur if you have an underactive thyroid that isn't treated.\nHeart problems\nIf you have an untreated underactive thyroid, your risk of developing cardiovascular disease\u00a0is increased.\nThis is because having low levels of the hormone thyroxine can lead to increased levels of cholesterol in your blood.\u00a0High cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up in your arteries, restricting\u00a0the flow of blood.\nContact your doctor if you're being treated for an underactive thyroid and you develop chest pain, so that any problems can be\u00a0detected and treated, if necessary.\u00a0\nGoitre\nA\u00a0goitre\u00a0is an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland that causes a lump to form in the throat. Goitres can develop in people with an underactive thyroid\u00a0when the body tries to\u00a0stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones.\nPregnancy complications\nIf an underactive thyroid isn't treated during pregnancy, there's a risk of problems occurring. These\u00a0include:\n\npre-eclampsia \u2013 which can cause\u00a0high blood pressure and fluid retention\u00a0in the mother and growth problems in the baby\nanaemia\u00a0in the mother\nan underactive thyroid in the baby\nbirth defects\nbleeding after birth\nproblems with the baby's physical and mental development\npremature birth or a low birthweight\nstillbirth\u00a0or miscarriage\n\nThese problems can usually be avoided with treatment under the guidance of a specialist in hormone disorders (an endocrinologist). Therefore, tell your GP if you have an underactive thyroid and you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant.\nMyxoedema coma\nIn very rare cases, a severe underactive thyroid may lead to a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma. This is where the thyroid hormone levels become very low, causing symptoms such as confusion, hypothermia\u00a0and drowsiness.\nMyxoedema coma requires emergency treatment in hospital. It's usually treated with thyroid hormone replacement medication given directly into a vein. In some cases, other treatments such as breathing support,\u00a0antibiotics and steroid medication (corticosteroids) are also required.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Urinary incontinence is the unintentional passing of urine. It is a common problem and is thought to affect millions of people worldwide.\nIt's not clear exactly how many people are affected, but it's estimated that between 3 and 6 million people in the UK may have some degree of urinary incontinence.\nUrinary incontinence affects both men and women, but it tends to be more common in women overall.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe symptoms of urinary incontinence depend on the type you have.\nThere are several types of urinary incontinence, but the most common are:\n\nstress incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure, for example when you cough or laugh\nurge incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pass urine, or soon afterwards\n\nIt is also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence.\nRead more about the symptoms of urinary incontinence\nWhat causes urinary incontinence?\nThe causes of urinary incontinence depend on the type.\nStress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening or damaging of the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter.\nUrge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscle, which controls the bladder.\nCertain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including:\n\npregnancy and vaginal birth\nobesity\na family history of incontinence\nincreasing age \u2013 although incontinence is not an inevitable part of ageing\n\nRead more about the causes of urinary incontinence\nSeeking medical advice\nAlthough you may feel embarrassed talking to someone about your symptoms, it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence as this can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem.\nUrinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a pelvic examination (in women) or rectal examination (in men).\nYour GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate.\nRead more about diagnosing urinary incontinence\nHow urinary incontinence is treated\nInitially, your GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms. These may include:\n\nlifestyle changes, such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol\npelvic floor exercises (exercising your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them) taught by a specialist\nbladder training (where you learn ways to help you wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine) guided by a specialist\n\nYou may also benefit from the use of incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and hand-held urinals (urine collection bottles).\nIf you are still unable to manage your symptoms, medication may be recommended.\nSurgery may also be considered. The specific procedures suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have.\nSurgical treatments for stress incontinence, such as tape or sling procedures, are used to reduce pressure on the bladder, or strengthen the muscles that control urination.\nOperations to treat urge incontinence include enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles.\nRead more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence and surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence\nPreventing urinary incontinence\nIt is not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it developing, such as:\n\ncontrolling your weight\navoiding or cutting down on alcohol\nkeeping fit \u2013 in particular, ensuring that your pelvic floor muscles are strong\ntrying to keep your pelvic floor muscles strong\n\nRead more about preventing urinary incontinence\n\n\nHaving urinary incontinence means you pass urine unintentionally.\nWhen and how this happens varies depending on the type of urinary incontinence you have.\nAlthough you may feel embarrassed about seeking help, it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence.\nUrinary incontinence is a common problem and seeing your GP can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem.\nCommon types of urinary incontinence\nAround nine in every 10 people with urinary incontinence have either stress incontinence or urge incontinence.\nStress incontinence is when you leak urine when your bladder is put under extra sudden pressure, for example when you cough. It is not related to feeling stressed. Other activities that may cause urine to leak include:\n\nsneezing\nlaughing\nheavy lifting\nexercise\n\nThe amount of urine passed is usually small, but stress incontinence can sometimes cause you to pass larger amounts, particularly if your bladder is very full.\nUrge incontinence, or urgency incontinence, is when you feel a sudden and very intense need to pass urine and you are unable to delay going to the toilet. There is often only a few seconds between the need to urinate and the release of urine.\nYour need to pass urine may be triggered by a sudden change of position, or even by the sound of running water. You may also pass urine during sex, particularly when you reach orgasm.\nThis type of incontinence often occurs as part of group of symptoms called overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), which is where the bladder muscle is more active than usual.\nAs well as sometimes causing urge incontinence, OAB can also mean you need to pass urine very frequently and you may need to get up several times during the night to urinate.\nLess common types of urinary incontinence\nMixed incontinence is when you have symptoms of both stress and urge incontinence. For example, you may leak urine if you cough or sneeze, and also experience very intense urges to pass urine.\nOverflow incontinence, also called chronic urinary retention, occurs when the bladder cannot completely empty when you pass urine. This causes the bladder to swell above its usual size.\nIf you have overflow incontinence, you may pass small trickles of urine very often. It may also feel as though your bladder is never fully empty and you cannot empty it even when you try.\nUrinary incontinence that is severe and continuous is sometimes known as total incontinence.\nTotal incontinence may cause you to constantly pass large amounts of urine, even at night. Alternatively, you may pass large amounts of urine only occasionally, and leak small amounts in between.\n\n\nUrinary incontinence occurs when the normal process of storing and passing urine is disrupted.\nThis can happen for a number of reasons, and certain factors may also increase your chance of developing urinary incontinence.\nSome of the possible causes will lead to short-term urinary incontinence, while others may cause a long-term problem. If the cause can be treated, this may cure your incontinence.\nCauses of stress incontinence\nStress incontinence occurs when the pressure inside your bladder as it fills with urine becomes greater than the strength of your urethra to stay closed (the urethra is the tube through which urine passes out of your body).\nAny sudden extra pressure on your bladder, such as laughing or sneezing, can then cause urine to leak out of your urethra.\nYour urethra may not be able to stay closed if the muscles in your pelvis (pelvic floor muscles) are weak or damaged, or your urethral sphincter (the ring of muscle that keeps the urethra closed) is damaged.\nThese problems may be caused by:\n\ndamage during childbirth, particularly if the child was born vaginally rather than by caesarean section\nincreased pressure on your tummy, for example because you are pregnant or obese\ndamage to the bladder or nearby area during surgery, such as the removal of the womb (hysterectomy) in women or removal of the prostate gland in men\nneurological conditions, which affect the brain and spinal cord, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis\ncertain connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\ncertain medications (see below)\n\nCauses of urge incontinence\nThe urgent and frequent need to pass urine can be caused by a problem with the detrusor muscle\u00a0in the wall\u00a0of the bladder. The detrusor muscles relax to allow the bladder to fill with urine, then contract when you go to the toilet to let the urine out.\nSometimes the detrusor muscle\u00a0contract too often, creating an urgent need to go to the toilet. This is known as having an 'overactive bladder'. The reason your detrusor muscle contracts too often may not be clear, but possible causes include:\n\ndrinking too much alcohol or caffeine\npoor fluid intake \u2013 this can cause strong, concentrated urine to collect in your bladder, which can irritate your bladder and cause symptoms of overactivity\nconstipation\nconditions affecting the lower urinary tract (urethra and bladder), such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or tumours in the bladder\nneurological conditions\ncertain medications (see below)\n\nCauses of overflow incontinence\nOverflow incontinence, also called chronic urinary retention, is often caused by a blockage or obstruction to your bladder. Your bladder may fill up as usual, but as it is obstructed you will not be able to empty it completely, even when you try.\nAt the same time, pressure from the urine that is still in your bladder builds up behind the obstruction, causing frequent leaks.\nYour bladder can become obstructed as a result of:\n\nan enlarged prostate gland (in men)\nbladder stones\nconstipation\n\nOverflow incontinence may also be caused by your detrusor muscle\u00a0not fully contracting, which means that your bladder does not completely empty when you go to the toilet. As a result, the bladder becomes stretched. Your detrusor muscles may not fully contract if:\n\nthere is damage to your nerves, for example as a result of surgery to part of your bowel or a spinal cord injury\nyou are taking certain medications (see below)\n\nCauses of total incontinence\nTotal incontinence occurs when your bladder cannot store any urine at all. It can result in you either passing large amounts of urine constantly, or passing urine occasionally with frequent leaking.\nTotal incontinence can be caused by:\n\na problem with your bladder from birth\ninjury to your spinal cord, which can disrupt the nerve signals between your brain and your bladder\na bladder fistula, which is a small tunnel-like hole that can form between the bladder and a nearby area, such as the vagina, in women\n\nMedications that may cause incontinence\nSome medicines can disrupt the normal process of storing and passing urine, or increase the amount of urine you produce. These include:\n\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\ndiuretics\nsome antidepressants\nhormone replacement therapy (HRT)\nsedatives\n\nStopping these medications, if advised to do so by a doctor, may help resolve your incontinence.\nWho is most at risk?\nIn addition to the causes mentioned above, there are some things that can increase your risk of developing urinary incontinence without directly being the cause of the problem. These are known as risk factors.\nSome of the main risk factors for urinary incontinence include:\n\nfamily history \u2013 there may be a genetic link to urinary incontinence, so you may be more at risk if other people in your family have experienced the problem\nincreasing age \u2013 urinary incontinence becomes more common as you reach middle age and is particularly common in people over 80\nhaving lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) \u2013 a range of symptoms that affect the bladder and urethra (read about the symptoms of urinary incontinence for more information)\n\n\n\nIf you experience urinary incontinence, see your GP so they can determine the type of condition you have.\nTry not to be embarrassed to speak to your GP about your incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a common problem and it's likely your GP has seen many people with the condition.\nYour GP will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history, including:\n\nwhether the urinary incontinence occurs when you cough or laugh\nwhether you need the toilet frequently during the day or night\nwhether you have any difficulty passing urine when you go to the toilet\nwhether you are currently taking any medications\nhow much fluid, alcohol or caffeine you drink\n\nBladder diary\nYour GP may suggest that you keep a diary of your bladder habits for at least three days, so you can give them as much information as possible about your condition. This should include details such as:\n\nhow much fluid you drink\nthe types of fluid you drink\nhow often you need to pass urine\nthe amount of urine you pass\nhow many episodes of incontinence you experience\nhow many times you experience an urgent need to go to the toilet\n\nTests and examinations\nYou may also need to have some tests and examinations so that your GP can confirm or rule out things that may be causing your incontinence. Some of these are explained below.\nYour GP may examine you to assess the health of your urinary system.\nIf you are female, your GP will carry out a pelvic examination, which usually involves undressing from the waist down. You may be asked to cough to see if any urine leaks out.\nYour GP may also examine your vagina. In over half of women with stress incontinence, part of the bladder may bulge into the vagina.\nYour GP may place their finger inside your vagina and ask you to squeeze it with your pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles that surround your bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes out of the body). Damage to your pelvic floor muscles can lead to urinary incontinence.\nIf you are male, your GP may check whether your prostate gland is enlarged. The prostate gland is located between the penis and bladder, and surrounds the urethra. If it is enlarged, it can cause symptoms of urinary incontinence, such as a frequent need to urinate.\nYou may also need a digital rectal examination to check the health of your prostate gland. This will involve your GP inserting their finger into your bottom.\nIf your GP thinks your symptoms may be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI), a sample of your urine may be tested for bacteria. A small, chemically treated stick is dipped into your urine sample. It will change colour if bacteria are present. The dipstick test can also check the blood and protein levels in your urine.\nIf your GP thinks you may have overflow incontinence, they may suggest a test called residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you go for a wee.\nThis is usually done by carrying out an ultrasound scan of your bladder, although occasionally the amount of urine in your bladder may be measured after it has been drained using a catheter. This is a thin, flexible tube that is inserted into your urethra and passed through to your bladder.\nFurther tests\nSome further tests may be necessary if the cause of your urinary incontinence is not clear. Your GP will usually start treating you first and may suggest these tests if treatment is not effective.\nA cystoscopy involves using a flexible viewing tube, known as an endoscope, to look inside your bladder and urinary system. This test can identify abnormalities that may be causing incontinence.\nThese are a group of tests used to check the function of your bladder and urethra. This may include keeping a bladder diary for a few days (see above) and then attending an appointment at a hospital or clinic for tests such as:\n\nmeasuring the pressure in your bladder by inserting a catheter into your urethra\nmeasuring the pressure in your abdomen (tummy) by inserting a catheter into your bottom\nasking you to urinate into a special machine that measures the amount and flow of urine\n\n\n\nThe treatment you receive for urinary incontinence will depend on the type of incontinence you have and the severity of your symptoms.\nIf your incontinence is caused by an underlying condition, such as an enlarged prostate gland in men, you may receive treatment for this alongside your incontinence treatment.\nConservative treatments, which do not involve medication or surgery, are tried first. These include:\n\nlifestyle changes\npelvic floor muscle training ('Kegel exercises')\nbladder training\n\nAfter this, medication or surgery may be considered.\nThis page is about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence. There is a separate page on surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence.\nThe various non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence are outlined below.\nLifestyle changes\nYour GP may suggest you make simple changes to your lifestyle to improve your symptoms. These changes can help improve your condition, regardless of the type of urinary incontinence you have.\nFor example, your GP may recommend:\n\nreducing your caffeine intake \u2013 caffeine is found in tea, coffee and cola and can increase the amount of urine your body produces\naltering how much fluid you drink a day \u2013 drinking too much or too little can make incontinence worse\nlosing weight if you are overweight or obese \u2013 use the healthy weight calculator to find out if you are a healthy weight for your height\n\nPelvic floor muscle training\nYour pelvic floor muscles are the muscles you use to control the flow of urine as you urinate. They surround the bladder and urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body).\nWeak or damaged pelvic floor muscles can cause urinary incontinence, so exercising these muscles is often recommended.\nYour GP may refer you to a specialist to start a programme of pelvic floor muscle training.\nYour specialist will assess whether you are able to squeeze (contract) your pelvic floor muscles and by how much. If you can contract your pelvic floor muscles, you will be given an individual exercise programme based on your assessment.\nYour programme should include doing a minimum of eight muscle contractions at least three times a day and doing the recommended exercises for at least three months. If the exercises are helping after this time, you can keep on doing them.\nResearch suggests that women who complete pelvic floor muscle training experience fewer leaking episodes and report a better quality of life.\nIn men, some studies have shown that pelvic floor muscle training can reduce urinary incontinence \u2013 particularly after surgery to remove the prostate gland.\nFor more information:\n\nThe British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS):\u00a0\u00a0Pelvic floor exercises in women (PDF, 163kb)\nPelvic, Obstetric and Gynaecology Physiotherapy (POGP): The Pelvic Floor Mucles - a Guide for Women (PDF, 1202kb)\n\nIf you are unable to contract your pelvic floor muscles, using a device that measures and stimulates the electrical signals in the muscles may be recommended. This is called electrical stimulation.\nA small probe will be inserted into the vagina in women or the anus in men. An electrical current runs through the probe, which helps to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles while you exercise them.\nYou may find electrical stimulation difficult or unpleasant to use, but it may be beneficial if you are unable to complete pelvic floor muscle contractions without it.\nBiofeedback is a way to monitor how well you are doing the pelvic floor exercises by giving you feedback as you do them. There are several different methods of biofeedback:\n\na small probe could be inserted into the vagina in women or the anus in men \u2013 this senses when the muscles are squeezed and sends the information to a computer screen\nelectrodes (sticky electrical patches) could be attached to the skin of your abdomen or around the anus \u2013 these sense when the muscles are squeezed and send the information to a computer screen\n\nThere isn't much good evidence to suggest biofeedback offers a significant benefit to people using pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence, but the feedback may help motivate some people to carry out their exercises.\nSpeak to your specialist if you would like to try biofeedback.\nBladder training\nIf you have been diagnosed with urge incontinence, one of the first treatments you may be offered is bladder training. Bladder training may also be combined with pelvic floor muscle training if you have mixed urinary incontinence.\nBladder training involves learning techniques to increase the length of time between feeling the need to urinate and passing urine. The course will usually last for at least six weeks.\nIncontinence products\nWhile incontinence products are not a treatment for urinary incontinence, you might find them useful for managing your condition while you are waiting to be assessed or waiting for treatment to take effect.\nIncontinence products include:\n\nabsorbent products, such as incontinence pants or pads\nhand-held urinals (urine collection bottles)\na catheter, a thin tube that is inserted into your bladder to drain urine\ndevices that are placed into the vagina or urethra to prevent urine leakage, for example while you exercise\n\nMedication for stress incontinence\nIf stress incontinence does not significantly improve, surgery for urinary incontinence will often be recommended as the next step.\nHowever, if you are unsuitable for surgery or you want to avoid having an operation, you may benefit from a medication called duloxetine. This can help increase the muscle tone of the urethra, which should help keep it closed.\nYou will need to take duloxetine by mouth twice a day and will be assessed after two to four weeks to see if the medicine is beneficial or if it is causing any side effects.\nPossible side effects of duloxetine can include:\n\nnausea\ndry mouth\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nconstipation\n\nDo not suddenly stop taking duloxetine as this can also cause unpleasant effects. Your GP will reduce your dose gradually.\nDuloxetine is not suitable for everyone, however, so your GP will discuss any other medical conditions you have to determine if you can take it.\nMedication for urge incontinence\nIf bladder training is not an effective treatment for your urge incontinence, your GP may prescribe a type of medication called an antimuscarinic.\nAntimuscarinics may also be prescribed if you have overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), which is the frequent urge to urinate that can occur with or without urinary incontinence.\nA number of different antimuscarinic medications that can be used to treat urge incontinence, but common ones include oxybutynin, tolterodine and darifenacin.\nThese are usually taken by mouth two or three times a day, although an oxybutynin patch that you place on your skin twice a week is also available.\nYour GP will usually start you at a low dose to minimise any possible side effects. The dose can then be increased until the medicine is effective.\nPossible side effects of antimuscarinics include:\n\ndry mouth\nconstipation\nblurred vision\nfatigue\n\nIn rare cases, antimuscarinic medication can also lead to a type of glaucoma (a build-up of pressure within the eye) called angle-closure glaucoma.\nYou will be assessed after four weeks to see how you are getting on with the medication, and every six to 12 months thereafter if the medication continues to help.\nYour GP will discuss any other medical conditions you have to determine which antimuscarinics are suitable for you.\nIf antimuscarinics are unsuitable for you, or they have not helped your urge incontinence or have caused unpleasant side effects, you may be offered an alternative medication called mirabegron.\nMirabegron causes the bladder muscle to relax, which helps the bladder fill up with and store urine. It is usually taken by mouth once a day.\nSide effects of mirabegron can include:\n\nurinary tract infections (UTIs)\na fast or irregular heartbeat\npalpitations (suddenly noticeable heartbeats)\na rash\nitching\n\nYour GP will discuss any other medical conditions you have to determine whether mirabegron is suitable for you.\nMedication for nocturia\nA medication called desmopressin may be used to treat nocturia, which is the frequent need to get up during the night to urinate, by helping to reduce the amount of urine produced by the kidneys.\nAnother type of medication taken late in the afternoon, called a loop diuretic, may also prevent you from getting up in the night to pass urine. Diuretic medicine increases the production and flow of urine from your body. By removing excess fluid from your body in the afternoon, it may improve symptoms at night.\nDesmopressin is licensed to treat bedwetting but is not licensed to treat nocturia. Loop diuretics are also not licensed to treat nocturia.\nThis means that the medication may not have undergone clinical trials (a type of research that tests one treatment against another) to see if it's effective and safe in the treatment of nocturia.\nHowever, your GP or specialist may suggest an unlicensed medication if they think it's likely to be effective and the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risk.\nIf your GP is considering prescribing desmopressin or a loop diuretic, they should tell you that it is unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you.\n\n\nIf other treatments for urinary incontinence are unsuccessful or unsuitable, surgery or other procedures may be recommended.\nBefore making a decision, discuss the risks and benefits with a specialist, as well as any possible alternative treatments.\nIf you are a woman and plan to have children, this will affect your decision, because the physical strain of pregnancy and childbirth can sometimes cause surgical treatments to fail. Therefore, you may wish to wait until you no longer want to have any more children before having surgery.\nThe various surgical treatments for urinary incontinence are outlined below.\nSurgery and procedures for stress incontinence\nColposuspension involves making an incision in your lower abdomen, lifting up the neck of your bladder, and stitching it in this lifted position. This can help prevent involuntary leaks in women with stress incontinence.\nThere are two types of colposuspension:\n\nan open colposuspension \u2013 where surgery is carried out through a large incision\na laparoscopic ('keyhole') colposuspension \u2013 where surgery is carried out through one or more small incisions using special, small surgical instruments\n\nBoth types of colposuspension offer effective, long-term treatment for stress incontinence, although laparoscopic colposuspension needs to be carried out by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon.\nProblems that can occur after colposuspension include difficulty emptying the bladder fully when going to the toilet, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and discomfort during sex.\nSling procedures involve making an incision in your lower abdomen and vagina so a sling can be placed around the neck of the bladder to support it and prevent accidental urine leaks. The sling can be made of:\n\na synthetic material\ntissue taken from another part of your body (an autologous sling)\ntissue donated from another person (an allograft sling)\ntissue taken from an animal (a xenograft sling), such as cow or pig tissue\n\nIn many cases, an autologous sling will be used and will be made using part of the layer of tissue that covers the abdominal muscles (rectus fascia). These slings are generally preferred because more is known about their long-term safety and effectiveness.\nThe most commonly reported problem associated with the use of slings is difficulty emptying the bladder fully when going to the toilet. A small number of women who have the procedure also find that they develop urge incontinence afterwards.\nAn urethral bulking agent is a substance that can be injected into the walls of the urethra in women with stress incontinence. This increases the size of the urethral walls and allows the urethra to stay closed with more force.\nA number of different bulking agents are available and there is no evidence that one is more beneficial than another.\nThis is less invasive than other surgical treatments for stress incontinence in women as it does not usually require any incisions. Instead, the substances are normally injected through a cystoscope (thin viewing tube) inserted directly into the urethra.\nHowever, this procedure is generally less effective than the other options available. The effectiveness of the bulking agents will also reduce with time and you may need repeated injections.\nMany women experience a slight burning sensation or bleeding when they pass urine for a short period after the bulking agents are injected.\nThe urinary sphincter is a ring of muscle that stays closed to prevent urine flowing from the bladder into your urethra. In some cases, it may be suggested that you have an artificial urinary sphincter fitted to relieve your incontinence.\nThis tends to be used more often as a treatment for men with stress incontinence and is only rarely used in women.\nAn artificial sphincter consists of three parts:\n\na circular cuff that is placed around the urethra \u2013 this can be filled with fluid when necessary to compress the urethra and prevent urine passing through it\na small pump placed in the scrotum (when used in men) that contains the mechanism for controlling the flow of fluid to and from the cuff\na small fluid-filled reservoir in the abdomen \u2013 the fluid passes between this reservoir and the cuff as the device is activated and de-activated\n\nThe procedure to fit an artificial urinary sphincter often causes short-term bleeding and a burning sensation when you pass urine. In the long-term, it is not uncommon for the device to eventually stop working, in which case further surgery may be needed to remove it.\nSurgery and procedures for urge incontinence\nBotulinum toxin A (Botox) can be injected into the sides of your bladder to treat urge incontinence and overactive bladder syndrome (OAB).\nThis medication can sometimes help relieve these problems by relaxing your bladder. This effect can last for several months and the injections can be repeated if they help.\nAlthough the symptoms of incontinence may improve after the injections, you may find it difficult to fully empty your bladder. If this happens, you will need to be taught how to insert a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) into your urethra to drain the urine from your bladder.\nBotulinum toxin A is not currently licensed to treat urge incontinence or OAB, so you should be made aware of any risks before deciding to have the treatment. The long-term effects of this treatment are not yet known.\nThe sacral nerves are located at the bottom of your back. They carry signals from your brain to some of the muscles used when you go to the toilet, such as the detrusor muscle that surrounds the bladder.\nIf your urge incontinence is the result of your detrusor muscle\u00a0contracting too often, sacral nerve stimulation \u2013 also known as sacral neuromodulation \u2013 may be recommended.\nDuring this operation, a device is inserted near one of your sacral nerves, usually in one of your buttocks. An electrical current is sent from this device into the sacral nerve. This should improve the way signals are sent between your brain and your detrusor muscles, and so reduce your urges to urinate.\nSacral nerve stimulation can be painful and uncomfortable, but some people report a substantial improvement in their symptoms or the end of their incontinence completely.\nYour posterior tibial nerve runs down your leg to your ankle. It contains nerve fibres that start from the same place as nerves that run to your bladder and pelvic floor. It is thought that stimulating the tibial nerve will affect these other nerves and help control bladder symptoms, such as the urge to pass urine.\nDuring the procedure, a very thin needle is inserted through the skin of your ankle and a mild electric current is sent through it, causing a tingling feeling and causing your foot to move. You may need 12 sessions of stimulation, each lasting around half an hour, one week apart.\nSome studies have shown that this treatment can offer relief from OAB and urge incontinence for some people, although there is not yet enough evidence to recommend tibial nerve stimulation as a routine treatment.\nTibial nerve stimulation is only recommended in a few cases where urge incontinence has not improved with medication and you don't want to have botulinum toxin A injections or sacral nerve stimulation.\nIn rare cases, a procedure known as augmentation cystoplasty may be recommended to treat urge incontinence.\nThis procedure involves making your bladder bigger by adding a piece of tissue from your intestine (part of the digestive system) into the bladder wall.\nAfter the procedure, you may not be able to pass urine normally and you may need to use a catheter. Due to this, augmentation cystoplasty will only be considered if you are willing to use a catheter.\nThe difficulties passing urine can also mean that people who have augmentation cystoplasty can experience recurrent urinary tract infections.\nUrinary diversion is a procedure where the ureters (the tubes that lead from your kidneys to your bladder) are redirected to the outside of your body. The urine is then collected directly without it flowing into your bladder.\nUrinary diversion should only be carried out if other treatments have been unsuccessful or are not suitable.\nUrinary diversion can cause a number of complications, such as a bladder infection, and sometimes further surgery is needed to correct any problems that occur.\nCatheterisation for overflow incontinence\nClean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) is a technique that can be used to empty the bladder at regular intervals and so reduce overflow incontinence (also known as chronic urinary retention).\nA continence adviser will teach you how to place a catheter through your urethra and into the bladder. Your urine will flow out of your bladder, through the catheter and into the toilet.\nUsing a catheter can feel a bit painful or uncomfortable at first, but any discomfort should subside over time.\nHow often CIC will need to be carried out will depend on your individual circumstances. For example, you may only need CIC once a day, or you may need to use the technique several times a day.\nRegular use of a catheter increases the risk of developing UTIs.\nIf using a catheter every now and then is not enough to treat your overflow incontinence, you can have an indwelling catheter fitted instead. This is a catheter inserted in the same way as for CIC, but left in place. A bag is attached to the end of the catheter to collect the urine.\n\n\nIt is not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of the condition developing.\nHealthy weight\nBeing obese can increase your risk of developing urinary incontinence. You may therefore be able to lower your risk by maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and healthy eating.\nFind more information and advice about losing weight\nDrinking habits\nDepending on your particular bladder problem, your GP can advise you about the amount of fluids that you should drink.\nIf you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. These can cause your kidneys to produce more urine and irritate your bladder.\nThe recommended daily limits for alcohol consumption are:\n\nthree to four units a day for men\ntwo to three units a day for women\n\nA unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. Read more about drinking and alcohol.\nIf you have to urinate frequently during the night (nocturia), try drinking less in the hours before you go to bed. However, make sure you still drink enough fluids during the day.\nPelvic floor exercises\nBeing pregnant and giving birth can weaken the muscles that control the flow of urine from your bladder. If you are pregnant, strengthening your pelvic floor muscles may help prevent urinary incontinence. Read more about staying active during pregnancy. Men may also benefit from strengthening their pelvic floor muscles by doing pelvic floor exercises.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs)\u00a0in children are fairly common, but not usually serious.

If your child's had a UTI before, it's important that both of you watch\u00a0for the return of any associated symptoms.\nTell your GP about any symptoms\u00a0as soon as possible so a diagnosis can be confirmed and treatment can begin.\nIf\u00a0your child\u00a0has a problem that increases their risk of UTIs, such as faulty valves that allow urine to flow the wrong way,\u00a0they may be prescribed low-dose\u00a0antibiotics as a long-term measure to prevent further infections.\n\n\nUrinary\u00a0tract infections (UTIs) in children can usually be diagnosed by your GP. They'll carry out a physical examination, ask about your child's symptoms, and request a urine sample.\u00a0\nYou may be asked to collect the urine sample yourself, or a doctor or nurse at your GP surgery may help you.\nThese tests help\u00a0your GP identify what's causing the infection and determine whether it's in the lower or upper part of the urinary tract.\nIf your child is less than three months old, your GP may refer you straight to hospital to see a\u00a0specialist in caring for children (paediatrician) without asking for a urine sample.\nCollecting a urine sample\nCollecting a urine sample from a child can sometimes be difficult, especially in babies and young children.\nIf you're not sure what to do or need some help collecting the urine sample, ask a doctor or nurse for advice.\nIn young children who are toilet trained, you'll usually be asked to collect a urine sample using a sterile bottle provided by your GP surgery.\nCollect a sample by holding the bottle in the stream of urine while your child is urinating. Make sure nothing touches the open rim of the bottle, as this could affect the result.\nIf you're unable to collect a clean sample, it may be collected using a special absorbent pad that you put in your baby's nappy. A urine sample is then sucked out of the pad using a syringe.\nIf a urine sample is very difficult to collect at home or in a GP surgery, you may need to go to a hospital.\nIn such cases, a urine sample can be obtained by inserting a small plastic tube called a catheter\u00a0into your child's urethra.\nFurther tests\nIn most cases, treatment begins soon after a urine sample has been taken and your child won't need any further tests.\nHowever, there are some circumstances where further tests may be carried out, including if:\n\nyour child is less than six months old\nthere's no improvement in your child's symptoms within 24 to 48 hours of treatment\nyour child has any unusual symptoms,\u00a0such as reduced urine flow, high blood pressure (hypertension), or a noticeable lump or mass in their tummy (abdomen) or bladder\nyour child has repeated UTIs\n\nIn these cases, doctors may recommend carrying out some scans to look for any abnormalities.\nThere are many different scans that may be carried out to check for problems in your child's urinary tract, including:\n\nan ultrasound scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where sound waves emitted by a special probe move over your child's skin and are used to build up a picture of the inside of their body\na\u00a0dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where your child is injected with a slightly radioactive substance called DMSA that shows up on a special device called a gamma camera, which takes pictures of your child's kidneys; after the scan, the DMSA will pass harmlessly out of your child's body in their urine\na\u00a0micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG)\u00a0\u2013 where a\u00a0catheter is used to pass a special type of liquid (contrast agent) that shows up clearly on\u00a0X-rays\u00a0into your child's bladder while\u00a0a series of X-rays are taken; as with the\u00a0DMSA scan, the contrast agent will pass harmlessly\u00a0out of your child's body in their urine\n\nThe type of scans used and when they're carried out depends on your child's specific circumstances. In some cases, these\u00a0scans\u00a0may be carried out a few weeks or months after your child originally developed the infection.\n\n\nMost urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children can be effectively treated with antibiotic medication.\nThis medication can often be given at home, although there are some situations where it may be necessary for your child to stay in hospital for a few days.\nTreatment at home\nIf your child is\u00a0over three months old and not thought to be at risk of serious illness, they can usually be treated at home with\u00a0antibiotics.\nThe recommended length of treatment depends on whether your child has:\n\na lower UTI\u00a0\u2013 usually a 3-day course\nan upper UTI\u00a0\u2013\u00a0usually a 7- to 10-day course\n\nYour child may experience some side effects while taking antibiotics, but these are usually mild and should pass\u00a0once they stop taking the medication.\nCommon side effects of antibiotics include:\n\nfeeling sick\nvomiting\nan upset stomach\ndiarrhoea\nloss of appetite\n\nIf necessary, paracetamol can also be used to treat any fever or discomfort your child has.\nHowever, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0\u2013 such as ibuprofen \u2013 shouldn't be used if your child has a UTI, as they can harm the kidneys. Aspirin should never be given to children under the age of 16.\nIf your child is\u00a0unable to swallow tablets or capsules, they\u00a0can be given antibiotics and paracetamol in liquid form.\nYour child's condition will usually improve within 24 to 48 hours of treatment. However, it's very important they finish the whole prescribed course of antibiotics to prevent the infection recurring.\nTreatment in hospital\nIf your child is less than three months old or it's\u00a0thought their condition could get worse, they'll be referred to hospital for treatment.\nDoctors may feel\u00a0your\u00a0child is at risk of becoming more seriously ill without hospital treatment if:\n\nthey appear to be very unwell, or they are dehydrated or unable to\u00a0keep down oral medication because\u00a0they keep\u00a0vomiting\nthey display unusual symptoms, such as reduced urine flow,\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension),\u00a0or a noticeable lump or mass in their tummy (abdomen) or bladder\nthey were previously diagnosed with a condition that affects their urinary system\n\nIn these cases, your child usually needs to stay in hospital for a few days to receive\u00a0antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenous antibiotics). As with cases treated at home, your child should improve within 24 to 48 hours.\nFollow-up\nMost UTIs in children clear up within a day or two and won't cause any long-term problems.\u00a0Go back to your\u00a0GP if your child isn't showing any signs of improvement by this point.\nIn many cases, your child won't need to be seen again once they've recovered. However, doctors may recommend carrying out some scans to check for any problems in your child's urinary tract that could have contributed to the infection.\nSituations where further tests may be recommended include when:\n\nyour child is less than six months old\nthere's no improvement in your child's symptoms within 24 to 48 hours of treatment\nyour child has any unusual symptoms,\u00a0such as reduced urine flow, high blood pressure, or a noticeable lump or mass in their abdomen or bladder\nyour child has repeated UTIs\n\nRead our page on\u00a0diagnosing UTIs in children for more information about the scans your child may have.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Urticaria\u00a0\u2013\u00a0also known as hives, weals, welts or nettle rash\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is a raised, itchy rash that appears on the skin.\u00a0It may appear on one part of the body or be spread across large areas.\u00a0\nThe rash is\u00a0usually very itchy and ranges in size from a few millimetres to the size of a hand.\nAlthough the affected area may change in\u00a0appearance within 24 hours, the rash usually settles within a few days.\nTypes of urticaria\u00a0\nDoctors may refer to urticaria as either:\n\nacute urticaria\u00a0\u2013 if the rash clears completely within 6\u00a0weeks\nchronic urticaria\u00a0\u2013 in rarer cases, where the rash persists or comes and goes for more than 6\u00a0weeks, often over many years\n\nA much rarer type of urticaria, known as urticaria vasculitis, can cause blood vessels inside the skin to become inflamed.\u00a0In these cases, the weals last longer than 24 hours, are more painful, and can leave a bruise.\nIf you have a rash, complete our self-help guide to assess your symptoms and find out what to do next\nWho's affected by urticaria?\nAcute urticaria (also known as short-term urticaria) is a common condition, estimated to affect around 1in 5\u00a0people\u00a0at some point in their lives.\nChildren are often\u00a0affected by the condition, as well as women aged 30 to 60, and people with a history of allergies.\nWhat causes urticaria?\nUrticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin. These substances cause the blood vessels in the affected area of skin to open up (often resulting in\u00a0redness or pinkness) and become leaky. This extra fluid in the tissues causes swelling and itchiness.\nHistamine is released for many reasons, including:\n\nan\u00a0allergic reaction \u2013 like a food allergy\u00a0or a reaction to an\u00a0insect bite or sting\ncold or heat\u00a0exposure\u00a0\ninfection \u2013 such as a\u00a0cold\ncertain medications \u2013 like\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antibiotics\n\nHowever, in many cases of urticaria, no obvious cause can be found.\nSome cases of long-term urticaria may be\u00a0caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. However, this is difficult to diagnose and the treatment options are the same.\nCertain triggers may also make the symptoms worse. These include:\n\ndrinking\u00a0alcohol\u00a0\ndrinking caffeine\nemotional\u00a0stress\nwarm temperature\n\nRead more about the causes of urticaria.\nDiagnosing urticaria\nYour GP will usually be able to diagnose urticaria by examining the rash. They may also ask you questions to find out what triggered your symptoms.\nIf your GP thinks that it's caused by an allergic reaction, you may be referred to an allergy clinic for\u00a0an allergy test. However, if you've had urticaria most days for more than 6\u00a0weeks, it's unlikely to be the result of\u00a0an allergy.\nYou may also be referred for a number of tests, including a\u00a0full blood count (FBC),\u00a0to find out whether\u00a0there's an underlying cause of your symptoms.\nRead more about diagnosing urticaria.\nTreating urticaria\nIn many cases, treatment isn't needed for urticaria, because the rash often gets better within a few days.\nIf the itchiness is causing you discomfort, antihistamines can help. Antihistamines are available over the counter at pharmacies \u2013 speak to your pharmacist for advice.\nA short course of steroid tablets (oral corticosteroids) may occasionally be needed for more severe cases of urticaria.\nIf you have persistent urticaria, you\u00a0may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). Treatment usually involves medication to relieve the symptoms, while identifying and avoiding potential triggers.\nRead about treating urticaria.\nComplications of urticaria\nAround a quarter of people with acute urticaria and half of people with chronic urticaria also develop angioedema, which is a deeper swelling of tissues.\nChronic urticaria can also be upsetting and negatively impact a person's mood and quality of life.\nAngioedema is swelling in the deeper layers of a person's skin. It's often severe and is caused by a build-up of fluid.\u00a0The\u00a0symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but usually affect the:\n\neyes\nlips\ngenitals\nhands\nfeet\n\nMedication such as antihistamines and short courses of oral corticosteroids (tablets) can be used to relieve the swelling.\nRead more about treating angioedema.\nLiving with any long-term condition can be difficult. Chronic urticaria can have a considerable negative impact on a person's mood and quality of\u00a0life. Living with itchy skin can be particularly upsetting.\nOne study found that chronic urticaria can have the same negative impact as heart disease. It also found that 1\u00a0in 7\u00a0people with chronic urticaria had some sort of psychological or emotional problem, such as:\u00a0\n\nstress\nanxiety\ndepression\n\nSee your GP if your urticaria is getting you down. Effective treatments are available to improve your symptoms.\nTalking to friends and family can also improve feelings of isolation and help you cope better with your condition.\nAnaphylaxis\nUrticaria can be one of the first symptoms of a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis.\nAnaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency.\n\n\nUrticaria occurs when histamine and other chemicals are released from under the skin's surface, causing the tissues to swell.\nShort-term (acute) urticaria\u00a0\nThe triggers of acute urticaria are unknown in around half of all cases.\nRecognised triggers include:\n\na food\u00a0allergy\u2013 to foods like peanuts, shellfish, eggs and cheese\nan\u00a0allergic reaction \u2013 to environmental factors like pollen, dust mites or chemicals\nan allergic reaction to latex \u2013 which can be a common problem in healthcare workers\ninfections \u2013 which can range from relatively trivial, like a\u00a0cold, to very serious, such as HIV\ninsect bites and stings\nemotional stress\ncertain medications that can cause urticaria as a side effect \u2013 including\u00a0antibiotics,\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin\nphysical triggers \u2013\u00a0like pressure to the skin, changes in temperature, sunlight, exercise or water\n\nLong-term (chronic) urticaria\nChronic urticaria may occur when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. This is known as an autoimmune reaction.\nAbout a third to half of all chronic cases of urticaria are thought to be autoimmune related.\nIt's not known why autoimmune urticaria develops, although it can sometimes occur\u00a0in combination with other autoimmune conditions, like:\n\nrheumatoid arthritis \u2013 when the immune system attacks the joints\nlupus \u2013 when\u00a0the immune system attacks the joints and skin, and people usually feel tired all the time\n\nChronic urticaria can also be linked to other chronic illnesses and infections, such as:\n\nviral\u00a0hepatitis (liver infection)\nintestinal parasites\nan underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\nan\u00a0overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\n\nChronic urticaria tends to come and go. Many people find that certain things make it reappear or make existing symptoms worse. Triggers sometimes include:\n\nstress\nalcohol\ncaffeine\nwarm temperatures\nprolonged pressure on the skin \u2013 this can happen by wearing tight clothing\nmedications \u2013such as NSAIDs, and the painkiller codeine\ncertain food additives \u2013such as salicylates, which are found in tomatoes, orange juice and tea\ninsect bites and stings\nexposure to heat, cold, pressure or water\n\nACE inhibitors that are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) can be linked to deeper swellings of angioedema.\n\n\nUrticaria can usually be diagnosed by examining the distinctive red rash.\nIf you have\u00a0long-term (chronic) urticaria, a number of tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause.\nShort-term (acute) urticaria\nYour GP can usually diagnose acute urticaria by examining the rash.\nThey'll also ask you some questions to find out what triggered your symptoms, including:\n\nwhen and where the rash\u00a0began\nwhat you had to eat just before it began and details of your usual diet\nif you started taking any new medication just before your symptoms began\nif you live or work in an environment where you come into contact with possible triggers \u2013 such as pets, chemicals or latex gloves\nif you were stung or bitten by an insect just before your symptoms started\nyour current state of health and if you've had any recent infections\nif you've recently travelled to a foreign country and if so, where\nif there's a history of urticaria in your family\n\nIn around half of all cases of acute urticaria,\u00a0a cause can't be identified.\nIf your GP thinks your symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction, you may have to go to an allergy clinic.\nAllergy testing\u00a0may be needed to find out if you're allergic to suspected triggers for urticaria.\nLong-term\u00a0(chronic) urticaria\nIf your urticaria lasts for more than 6\u00a0weeks, it's very unlikely\u00a0to be caused by an allergy, so allergy tests aren't usually recommended.\nHowever, your GP should ask about anything that makes your urticaria worse, like:\n\nany medicines you're taking\nyour\u00a0alcohol and caffeine consumption\nyour stress levels\n\nYou may also be referred for a number of tests to find out if there's an underlying cause of your chronic urticaria. These tests may include:\n\na full blood count test (FBC) \u2013 which can identify anaemia\ntests to determine the levels of antibodies in your blood\na stool sample \u2013 which can identify intestinal parasites\nan erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test \u2013 which can help to identify problems with your immune system\nthyroid function tests \u2013 which can be used to check for\u00a0an\u00a0underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) or\u00a0an\u00a0overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)\nliver function tests \u2013 which can be used to check if you have any problems with your liver\n\n\n\nMost cases of urticaria don't need treatment, because the symptoms are usually mild and often get better within a few days.\nShort-term (acute) urticaria\nIf your symptoms are troublesome or persistent,\u00a0antihistamines are available over the counter from pharmacies.\nSee your GP or speak to your pharmacist if your symptoms get worse. If your symptoms are very severe, your GP may prescribe other medications,\u00a0such as a short course of corticosteroid tablets.\nGo back to your GP if your\u00a0symptoms get worse or if the treatment hasn't worked after 2\u00a0weeks.\nAntihistamines\u00a0block the effects of histamine, helping to stop the itchiness and reduce the rash. Examples of antihistamines include:\n\ncetirizine\u00a0\nfexofenadine\u00a0\nloratadine\u00a0\n\nFor most people, modern antihistamines don't cause drowsiness, although there are some exceptions. See how you react to the antihistamine before driving or operating heavy machinery. Antihistamines may also cause drowsiness if taken with alcohol. Always read the information leaflet that comes with the medication.\nAntihistamines aren't usually prescribed to pregnant women, as it's not known whether they're entirely safe. However, chlorphenamine may be recommended if it's believed that the benefits outweigh the risks. There's no evidence that\u00a0chlorphenamine harms unborn babies.\nYou may be prescribed a short course of high-dose corticosteroid tablets, such as prednisolone, if your symptoms are severe.\nCorticosteroids suppress your immune system, which lessens the symptoms of urticaria. A course of prednisolone lasting between 3\u00a0and 5\u00a0days is usually recommended.\nTaking steroid tablets on a long-term basis isn't usually recommended, because it can lead to a wide range of side effects and complications, such as:\u00a0\n\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nglaucoma\ncataracts\ndiabetes (or it can make existing diabetes worse)\n\nLong-term (chronic) urticaria\nTreatment for chronic urticaria involves trying to control your symptoms and avoiding any triggers that make them worse.\nIf you have chronic urticaria and angioedema, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). This is because angioedema is potentially more serious and can cause breathing difficulties.\nYou should also be referred to a\u00a0dermatologist if you just have chronic urticaria and the symptoms continue, despite treatment.\nChronic urticaria is treated with antihistamines. You may have to take them regularly for as long as your symptoms last.\nAn\u00a0increased dose may be recommended if your symptoms don't respond to treatment. Increasing the dose can often help to control symptoms that previously didn't respond to treatment. However, this should only be carried\u00a0out under the\u00a0instruction of\u00a0the doctor in charge of your care.\nMenthol cream can be used as an alternative or in addition to antihistamines because it helps to relieve itchiness. Your GP can prescribe this.\nOccasionally, more serious episodes of urticaria can be treated with short doses of corticosteroid tablets, such as prednisolone. Possible side effects of corticosteroid tablets include:\n\nincreased appetite\nweight gain\nmood change\ndifficulty sleeping (insomnia)\n\nLong-term use of corticosteroids for chronic urticaria isn't recommended for the reasons mentioned above.\nThe type of antihistamines you can get from the pharmacist are known as H1 antihistamines. However, there are several other types of antihistamines, including H2 antihistamines.\nH2 antihistamines can sometimes be useful for treating chronic urticaria, because they narrow blood vessels, which can reduce the skin's redness.\nH2 antihistamines can be used\u00a0as an alternative to\u00a0H1 antihistamines or in combination with them. Side effects of H2 antihistamines are uncommon, but include:\n\nheadache\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\ndizziness\u00a0\n\nLeukotriene receptor antagonists are a type of medication that can help to reduce redness and swelling of the skin.\nThey can be a useful long-term alternative to using corticosteroid tablets, because they don't carry the same risk of causing wide-ranging side effects.\nThe side effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists are rare\u00a0and relatively minor. They include\u00a0headaches and nausea (feeling sick).\nIn around two-thirds of cases, a powerful medication called ciclosporin has proved effective in treating urticaria.\nCiclosporin works in a similar way to\u00a0corticosteroids. It suppresses the harmful effects of the immune system and is available in capsule form or as a liquid.\nSide effects of ciclosporin include:\n\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nkidney problems\u00a0\nincreased levels of\u00a0blood cholesterol\u00a0\nheadaches\ninvoluntary shaking (tremors)\nincreased vulnerability to infection, particularly chest infections,\u00a0urinary tract infections (UTIs) and a type of viral infection known as\u00a0cytomegalovirus\n\nThere are also a number of other side effects that can occur when taking ciclosporin, and you should discuss these thoroughly with your doctor before starting.\u00a0\u00a0\nSide effects, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, are a particular cause for concern, because they can increase your risk of\u00a0heart disease and stroke.\nEven if you still respond to treatment, it may be recommended that the medication is withdrawn after a few months.\nFor urticaria that hasn't responded to antihistamines, there are newer medications becoming available, such as omalizumab.\u00a0Omalizumab is given by\u00a0injection and\u00a0is thought to reduce a type of antibody that can play a part in urticaria.\nThere's some\u00a0uncertainty over the role of diet in people with\u00a0long-term\u00a0urticaria. There are 2\u00a0groups of chemicals in foods that may trigger urticaria in some people \u2013vasoactive amines and salicylates.\nThe\u00a0Allergy UK website has more information on:\n\nvasoactive amines\nsalicylates\n\nAvoiding or cutting down on foods that contain these chemicals may improve your symptoms. You could also keep a food diary to see whether avoiding certain foods helps you.\nHowever, you should talk to a dietitian before restricting your diet. They can make sure you're not avoiding foods unnecessarily and that your diet is healthy.\nAvoiding urticaria triggers\nIf you know what triggers your urticaria or makes it worse, avoiding the trigger may keep your symptoms\u00a0under control.\nTriggers such as\u00a0alcohol and caffeine can be easily avoided. If you think that a certain\u00a0medication may be triggering your symptoms, contact the doctor who prescribed it, because alternatives may be available.\nAvoiding\u00a0stress can be more difficult, particularly if your symptoms negatively affect your quality of life.\nIf you have severe urticaria or urticaria that keeps coming back, you may find that relaxation techniques, such as meditation or hypnosis, reduce your stress levels and the severity of your symptoms.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Vaginal cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the vagina.\nCancer that begins in the vagina is called primary vaginal cancer. Cancer that begins in another part of the body \u2013 such as the cervix, womb or ovaries \u2013 and spreads to the vagina is known as secondary vaginal cancer.\nThis topic is about primary vaginal cancer. There are separate topics on cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and womb cancer.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe most common symptom of vaginal cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding. This includes:\n\nbleeding between your normal\u00a0periods, or after sex\nbleeding after the menopause (post-menopausal bleeding)\n\nOther symptoms can include:\n\nsmelly or bloody vaginal discharge\npain during sex\npain when urinating\nneeding to urinate more frequently than usual\nblood in your urine\npelvic pain\nan itch or lump in your vagina\n\nSpeak to your GP if you experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding, changes in your usual pattern of periods (such as irregular periods or heavier periods than usual), or problems urinating.\nWhile it's highly unlikely that these symptoms are caused by vaginal cancer, they should still be investigated by your GP. Read more about diagnosing vaginal cancer.\nWhat causes vaginal cancer?\nThe exact causes of vaginal cancer are unknown, but things that may increase your risk of developing it include:\n\nbeing infected with a particularly persistent type of the human papilloma virus (HPV), which can be spread during sex\nyour age \u2013 7\u00a0out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer affect women and anyone with a vagina over 60\na previous history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) \u2013 abnormal cells in the vagina or cervix that can sometimes become cancerous\n\nAs there is a possible link with HPV, it may be possible to reduce your risk of vaginal cancer by practising safe sex.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0HPV vaccination,\u00a0which is routinely offered to girls who are 12 to 13 years old, provides protection against 2\u00a0strains of HPV thought to be responsible for most cases of vaginal and cervical cancer.\nRead more about the causes of vaginal cancer.\nHow vaginal cancer is treated\nTreatment for vaginal cancer depends on which part of your vagina is affected and how far the cancer has spread (known as the 'stage').\nThe main treatments for vaginal cancer are:\n\nradiotherapy \u2013 radiation is used to destroy the cancerous cells\nsurgery to remove the cancerous cells\nchemotherapy \u2013 medication is used to kill the cancerous cells; this is often used in combination with radiotherapy\n\nThese treatments can cause both short- and long-term side effects that should be discussed with your care team before treatment begins.\nRead more about treating vaginal cancer\n\n\nCancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nThe exact\u00a0reason why this happens in cases\u00a0of vaginal cancer is unknown, but certain things can\u00a0increase your chances of developing the condition.\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV)\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a\u00a0group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. HPV is spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.\nThere are many different types of HPV and up to 8\u00a0out of every 10 people are infected with\u00a0the\u00a0virus\u00a0at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn't lead to vaginal cancer.\nHowever, HPV is present in\u00a0more than\u00a0two-thirds of people with vaginal cancer, which suggests that it may increase your risk of developing the condition.\u00a0\nHPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer. It's thought that the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vagina.\nAbnormal cells in the cervix or vagina\nYou're more likely to develop vaginal cancer if you've previously been found to have abnormal cells in your:\n\ncervix\u00a0\u2013 known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)\nvagina\u00a0\u2013 known as\u00a0vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN)\n\nCIN and VAIN are terms used to describe cells that are abnormal, but not different enough to be considered cancerous. Both are thought to be closely linked to having a persistent HPV infection.\nThe\u00a0abnormal cells\u00a0don't\u00a0usually cause any problems themselves and\u00a0may only be detected during cervical screening, but left untreated there is a small chance they could eventually become cancerous.\nIf you're found to have CIN or VAIN, a procedure to remove or destroy the abnormal cells may be recommended.\nDiethylstilbestrol\nA medicine called diethylstilbestrol is known to increase your risk of vaginal cancer. The medication\u00a0was widely prescribed during pregnancy between 1938\u00a0and 1971, because it was thought it\u00a0could help reduce the risk of miscarriage.\nHowever, in 1971, researchers discovered a link between diethylstilbestrol and cancer in the children of women given the medicine.\u00a0The use of diethylstilbestrol during pregnant was then banned.\nThe risk of vaginal cancer associated with\u00a0diethylstilbestrol is small and as it's now\u00a0over 40 years since it was last\u00a0used during pregnancies, cases of vaginal cancer linked to the medication are very rare.\nOther possible factors\nOther things that may increase your risk of vaginal cancer include:\n\nyour age \u2013 7\u00a0out of every 10 cases of vaginal cancer occur in women and anyone with a vagina over 60\nhaving a history of reproductive cancers, such as\u00a0cervical cancer or\u00a0vulval cancer\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you were treated\u00a0with\u00a0radiotherapy\nsmoking\nhaving HIV\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: risks and causes of vaginal cancer\n\n\n\nTo help diagnose vaginal cancer, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and may carry out a physical examination.\nThey may also refer you for\u00a0blood tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as infection.\nIf your GP cannot find an obvious cause of your symptoms, they will probably refer you to a gynaecologist for further testing. A gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.\nIf your GP refers you urgently because they think you have cancer, you have the right to be seen by a specialist within 2\u00a0weeks. Read more about NHS waiting times.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained mass in or at the entrance to their vagina.\nSeeing a gynaecologist\nIf you are referred to a gynaecologist, you may have:\n\nexternal and internal vaginal examinations to look for any unusual lumps or swellings\na\u00a0colposcopy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an examination where a special instrument (colposcope) that acts like a magnifying glass is used to study your vagina in greater detail\n\nIf your\u00a0gynaecologist thinks there may be abnormal tissue inside your vagina, a small sample of the tissue will be removed and checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. This is known as a biopsy.\nIf the results of the biopsy suggest you have cancer, you\u00a0may have further tests to see if the cancer has spread.\nThese tests may include a more\u00a0detailed internal vaginal examination carried out under\u00a0general anaesthetic, X-rays, computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\nStaging\nHealthcare professionals use a staging system to describe how far vaginal cancer has advanced.\n\nstage 1\u00a0\u2013 the cancer has started to grow into the wall of the vagina\nstage 2\u00a0\u2013 the cancer has begun to spread outside the vagina into the surrounding tissues\nstage 3\u00a0\u2013 the cancer has spread into your pelvis and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes\nstage 4a\u00a0\u2013 the cancer has spread beyond your vagina and into organs such as your bladder or back passage (rectum)\nstage 4b\u00a0\u2013 the cancer has spread into organs further away, such as the lungs\n\nThe stage of your cancer is important in determining which treatment is most appropriate and whether a cure is possible. Generally, the lower the stage when cancer is diagnosed, the better the chance of a cure.\nIf a cure is not possible, treatment can still help\u00a0relieve\u00a0any symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer. Read more about how vaginal cancer is treated.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: tests for vaginal cancer\nCancer Research UK: stages of vaginal cancer\n\n\n\nTreatment for vaginal cancer will depend on where the cancer is in your vagina and how far it has spread. Possible treatments include radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.\nWhen you are diagnosed with cancer, you will be cared for by a group of different healthcare professionals, known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT).\nYour MDT will include a range of specialists, including surgeons, clinical oncologists (specialists in the non-surgical treatment of cancer), and\u00a0specialist cancer nurses.\nYour MDT will recommend a treatment plan they feel is most suitable for you, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy\u00a0is the main treatment for vaginal cancer. It can be used:\n\nas an initial treatment to cure the cancer\nin combination with chemotherapy (chemoradiation)\nafter surgery to prevent the cancer from returning\nto control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative radiotherapy)\n\nThere are 2\u00a0main ways that radiotherapy for vaginal cancer can be given:\n\nexternal radiotherapy \u2013\u00a0a machine beams high-energy rays at your vagina and pelvis\ninternal radiotherapy \u2013 a small radioactive device, which looks like a tampon, is inserted into your vagina\n\nThe type of radiotherapy you receive depends on where the cancer is in your body. For example, internal radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is in the lining of your vagina, and external radiotherapy may be used if the cancer is deeper in the tissues of the vagina. You can\u00a0receive a combination of internal and external radiotherapy.\nExternal radiotherapy is usually given for around 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks in short daily sessions, from Monday to Friday. You return home between treatments and have a break\u00a0at the weekends.\nInternal radiotherapy may involve either a long treatment session where you need to stay in hospital for 24 hours, or several short day-case treatments.\nRead more about how radiotherapy is performed.\nFollowing radiotherapy, it's likely you will have some side effects. These occur because radiotherapy temporarily damages some healthy cells as well as destroying cancerous ones.\nPossible side effects of radiotherapy for vaginal cancer include:\n\nsore, red skin\u00a0\u2013 similar to\u00a0sunburn\nvaginal discharge\npain while passing urine\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\nfeeling sick\u00a0\nnarrowing of the vagina (see below)\nearly menopause and infertility (see below)\n\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy.\nRadiotherapy may cause you to lose interest in sex, particularly if you have side effects such as tiredness or nausea, or you are anxious about your condition or treatment.\nRadiotherapy can also cause scar tissue to form in your vagina, which can make it narrower and means having sex is difficult or uncomfortable.\nIf you feel up to it, your care team may suggest having sex regularly during treatment to help stop this happening. Devices called dilators, which are inserted into the vagina, can also be used after treatment stops to help\u00a0stop your vagina getting narrower.\nYou may also experience some\u00a0vaginal dryness or pain when having sex. If this happens, you can try using lubricants or asking your\u00a0care team about\u00a0possible treatments.\nIf you have external radiotherapy to your pelvis, you may experience an early\u00a0menopause (if you have not had the menopause already).\nThis means you will no longer be able to have children (infertility). Before your treatment, your\u00a0care team will explain whether this is a risk and discuss the options and support\u00a0available.\nSurgery\nThere are 4\u00a0main types of surgery used to treat vaginal cancer:\n\npartial vaginectomy \u2013 removing the upper section of your vagina\nradical vaginectomy \u2013\u00a0removing all of your vagina and pelvic lymph nodes\nradical vaginectomy and radical hysterectomy \u2013\u00a0removing all of your vagina, womb, ovaries, fallopian tubes and pelvic lymph nodes\npelvic exenteration \u2013 removing all of your vagina and surrounding tissue, including the bladder and/or rectum (back passage)\n\nA partial vaginectomy can be used to treat\u00a0stage 1\u00a0vaginal cancer, when radiotherapy has failed to remove the cancer or where a woman prefers to have surgery rather than radiotherapy because she still wants to have children.\nYour surgeon will remove the cancerous section of the vagina, as well as\u00a0some surrounding healthy tissue, just in case a small number of cancerous cells have spread.\nYour surgeon will repair the defect in the vaginal wall, which means you will be able to have sex after you have recovered from the operation.\nA radical vaginectomy\u00a0may be\u00a0used to treat cases of advanced stage 1 and stage 2 vaginal cancer. The surgeon will remove most, or all, of your vagina.\nA plastic surgeon may be able to make a new vagina using skin, muscle and tissue taken from another part of your body \u2013 usually one of your thighs or buttocks.\nYou will still be able to have sex after a vaginal reconstruction, although you will need to use lubricant, because\u00a0the lining of the new vagina cannot make the mucus it would naturally make.\nA radical hysterectomy is often\u00a0performed at the same time as a radical vaginectomy.\nDuring a radical hysterectomy, all of the reproductive system is removed, including the womb, fallopian tubes, ovaries and nearby lymph nodes.\nPelvic exenteration is used in a few cases to treat recurrent or advanced cases of vaginal cancer.\nIf\u00a0you no longer have a bladder, you will need another way to pass urine. One solution is for your surgeon to make a hole (stoma) in your tummy. A bag is then attached to the stoma so that urine can be passed into it. The bag is known as a urostomy bag.\nSimilarly, as you\u00a0may no longer have a rectum, you will need a way to pass stools (faeces) out of your digestive system. Another stoma can be made and attached to a collection bag, known as a colostomy bag.\nRead more about colostomies.\nA vaginal reconstruction can be carried out after\u00a0a pelvic exenteration. It\u00a0may also be possible to reconstruct your rectum and attach it to the remaining section of your bowel once this has healed. In this case, you will only need a temporary colostomy.\nAs pelvic exenteration is major surgery, it may take you several months to fully recover from the operation.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy\u00a0is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible (palliative chemotherapy). It's usually given by injection (intravenous chemotherapy).\nLike radiotherapy, the powerful cancer-killing medicines used in chemotherapy can also damage healthy tissue and cause a range of side effects. Side effects of chemotherapy for vaginal cancer can include:\n\ntiredness\nfeeling sick\nincreased risk of infections\ndiarrhoea\nhair loss\n\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\nCoping with treatment\nTreatment for vaginal cancer can have a significant emotional impact, particularly for young women who experience an early menopause as a result of treatment.\nThe removal of some or all of the vagina can be traumatic for pre- and post-menopausal women alike, and\u00a0some women feel less 'womanly' than they did before. It's not uncommon to feel a sense of loss and bereavement after treatment. In some women, this may lead to depression.\nYou may find it helpful to talk to other women who have had similar treatment. Your GP or hospital staff may be able to recommend a suitable local support group. Charities can also help:\n\nMacmillan Cancer Support\u00a0has information\u00a0on\u00a0groups you can join and a support line that you can call for free on 0808 808 00 00 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm)\nCancer Research UK\u00a0provides a free phone number that you can call on 0808 800 40 40 (Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm)\n\nIf feelings of depression persist,\u00a0speak to your\u00a0GP about the treatment and support available.\nClinical trials\nAs vaginal cancer is rare, you may be asked to take part in a\u00a0clinical trial. Clinical trials are an important way for healthcare professionals to learn more about the best way to treat specific conditions.\nMost clinical trials involve comparing a new treatment with an existing treatment to determine whether the new treatment is more or less effective. If you do receive a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing one.\nYou can find out whether there are currently any\u00a0clinical trials for vaginal cancer, or ask your care team if there are clinical trials in your area. Your care team can explain the advantages and disadvantages of taking part.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: treating vaginal cancer\nMacmillan: treatment\u00a0of vaginal cancer\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Varicose eczema is a long-term skin condition that affects the lower legs and is common in people with varicose veins.\nIt\u00a0is\u00a0also known as venous eczema, gravitational eczema and\u00a0stasis eczema.\nSigns and symptoms\nLike all types of eczema,\u00a0the affected skin becomes:\n\nitchy\nred and\u00a0swollen\ndry and\u00a0flaky\u00a0\nscaly or crusty\n\nThere may be periods\u00a0when these symptoms\u00a0improve and periods when they become more severe.\nYour legs may become swollen, especially towards the end of the day or after long periods of standing.

It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid.\nVaricose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins aren\u2019t working properly.\nRead more about the causes of varicose eczema.\nHow varicose eczema is treated\nVaricose eczema tends to be a long-term\u00a0problem. However, treatments are available to help keep\u00a0it under control.\nFor most people, treatment involves a combination of:\n\nself-help measures \u2013 including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs\nemollients \u2013 moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry)\ntopical corticosteroids \u2013 ointments and creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms\ncompression stockings \u2013 specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that steadily squeeze your legs and help to improve your circulation\n\nIf these treatments don\u2019t help, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) in case there is another cause for your symptoms or if they are concerned you may also have a type of eczema called contact dermatitis.\nIf you also have varicose veins, you may be referred to a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) who can talk to you about the treatment options for varicose veins.\nRead\u00a0more about\u00a0treating varicose eczema.\n\n\nVaricose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in your leg veins.\nInside your veins there are\u00a0valves that let the blood through in one direction and prevent it flowing backwards.\nSometimes, the walls of the veins can become stretched and lose their elasticity, causing the valves to become weakened. If the valves do not function properly,\u00a0blood may leak backwards.\nThis\u00a0increases the pressure in your veins, which may cause fluid to leak into surrounding tissues. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of your immune system reacting to these fluids in the tissues under your skin.\nThis increase in pressure can also cause blood to collect in your veins, which become swollen and enlarged (varicose veins).\nWho's\u00a0most at risk?\nIt is not fully understood why the walls of the veins stretch and the valves weaken.\u00a0Some\u00a0people develop the condition\u00a0for no obvious reason, although there are certain\u00a0factors that increase the chances of this happening, including:\n\ngender \u2013 varicose eczema is more common in women\nobesity \u2013 this can increase the pressure in your leg veins\npregnancy\u00a0\u2013 this can also\u00a0increase the pressure in your\u00a0leg veins\nnot being able to move for a long period of time \u2013 this can affect the circulation in\u00a0your leg veins\nhaving previously had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013\u00a0blood clots that develop in\u00a0leg veins, which can damage the\u00a0valves in your veins\nincreasing age \u2013 people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation\n\n\n\nSee your GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. They can usually make a diagnosis by simply looking at the affected areas.\nYour GP will also ask you questions to determine whether you have a problem with the flow of blood in your leg veins, as this is the main cause of varicose eczema.\nTo help make a diagnosis, your GP may want to know if you have a history of:\n\nvaricose veins\u00a0\u2013 swollen and enlarged veins\ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013\u00a0a blood clot in one of the deep veins of your legs\nleg ulcers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal\ncellulitis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue\nsurgery or injury to your legs\n\nYour GP may also check the pulse in your feet and they may carry out an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you. See the section on\u00a0treating varicose eczema for more information about these.\nThe ABPI test involves comparing blood pressure readings taken from your ankles and upper arms. A significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries\u00a0\u2013 in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use.\nReferral to a specialist\nYou may be referred to a specialist in a local hospital for further tests. This might be\u00a0a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon\u00a0specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) or a dermatologist (a specialist in skin conditions) if:\n\nyou have varicose veins and changes to your skin, such as varicose eczema, lipodermatosclerosis (hard, tightened skin) or a history of\u00a0leg ulcers\nyou have very poor blood flow in the blood vessels in your legs\u00a0\nyour symptoms don't get better, despite treatment\u00a0\nit is possible that you may have\u00a0contact dermatitis\n\n\n\nTreatment for varicose eczema aims to improve the condition of your skin, treat your symptoms and help improve your circulation (blood flow).\nFor many people, this will involve long-term treatment with a combination of:\n\nemollients (moisturisers)\u00a0\ntopical corticosteroids\ncompression stockings\n\nThere are also some self-help techniques that you can try. These treatment options are described in more detail below.\nLipodermatosclerosis (hardened,\u00a0tight skin) is treated in a similar way to varicose eczema. If you have a venous leg ulcer, you can also\u00a0read about treating venous leg ulcers.\nSelf-help\nThere are some steps you can take to reduce the symptoms of varicose eczema and help prevent further problems, such as:\n\ntry to avoid injuring your skin \u2013\u00a0injuries to your skin could lead to an ulcer\u00a0developing\nraise your legs when you are resting \u2013\u00a0for example, by propping up your feet on some pillows\u00a0(ideally so that they are above the level of your heart), as this can help reduce swelling\u00a0\nkeep physically active\u00a0\u2013 this will improve your circulation and\u00a0help you maintain a healthy weight\n\nFluid\u00a0can build up\u00a0in the lower legs if you sit or stand for too long, so it is important to keep moving. Walking will get your muscles working and help to push the blood through the veins to your heart.\nThe\u00a0National Eczema Society also recommends regularly flexing your feet and rising up onto your toes or bending down at the knees.\nEmollients\nEmollients are\u00a0moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film.\u00a0They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema.\nA\u00a0number of different emollients are available. Some can be bought over the counter without a prescription, but if you have varicose eczema it may be helpful to ask your GP\u00a0to recommend a suitable product.\nYou may need to try several different emollients to find one that works for you. You may also be prescribed a mixture of emollients, for example:\n\nan ointment for very dry skin\u00a0\na cream or lotion for less dry skin\nan emollient to use instead of soap\u00a0\nan emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower\n\nThe difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil that\u00a0they contain. Ointments contain the most oil, so they can be quite greasy, but\u00a0are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of\u00a0oil, so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between.\nIf you have varicose eczema, you should use\u00a0an emollient at least twice a day, even if you do not have any symptoms.\nTo apply the emollient:\n\nuse a large amount\u00a0\u2013 you should aim to cover all of the skin on your lower leg, not just the obviously affected areas\ndon't rub it in\u00a0\u2013\u00a0instead, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows\napply\u00a0every 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0hours for very dry skin\u00a0\nafter a bath or shower, gently dry the skin, then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist\u00a0\ndo not share emollients with other people\n\nIt is very important to keep using emollients during a flare-up of varicose eczema, because this is when the skin needs the most moisture.\u00a0Apply emollients frequently and in generous amounts during a flare-up.\nIt\u2019s unusual for emollients to cause side effects, but they can occasionally cause a rash, and greasy emollients may sometimes cause folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles). If you experience any side effects from your emollient, speak to your GP, who can prescribe an alternative product.\nEmollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.\u00a0\u00a0\nTopical corticosteroids\nIf your skin is inflamed from a flare-up of varicose eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin in the form of a cream or ointment) to quickly reduce the inflammation. They are also commonly known as topical steroids.\nDifferent strength topical corticosteroids can be prescribed, depending on the severity of your varicose eczema. If you have flare-ups of lipodermatosclerosis, you may need a very strong topical corticosteroid.\nWhen using corticosteroids, only apply the treatment to the affected areas. Your doctor can advise you\u00a0on how much to apply and how often. You can also check the advice in the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication.\nMost people only have to apply a topical corticosteroid once a day. When applying the medication, you should:\n\napply your emollient first and wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid (until the emollient has soaked into your skin)\napply it only to the affected area\nuse the topical corticosteroid for\u00a07 to 14 days and continue to apply the treatment for 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared\n\nIf your varicose eczema is moderate to severe, you may need to apply topical corticosteroids both between flare-ups and during them.\nIf you need to use topical corticosteroids on a long-term basis, you should apply them less frequently. Your GP will advise you\u00a0on how often you should be applying them.\nYou should also speak to your GP if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved.\nTopical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them, particularly if using a cream.\nGenerally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for prolonged periods will increase your risk of getting more serious side effects, such as thinning of the skin. Your doctor will advise you as to the strength of the medication you require and when you should use it.\nCompression stockings\nMedical compression stockings are specially designed to steadily squeeze your legs to help improve your circulation. They are tightest at the ankle and get gradually looser as they go further up your leg. This encourages blood to flow upwards towards your heart.\nMedical compression stockings are used to treat varicose eczema and lipodermatosclerosis by improving the flow of blood through your leg veins and reducing the pressure in the veins.\nCompression stockings are available in a variety of different sizes and pressures. They are also available in:\n\ndifferent colours\ndifferent lengths \u2013 some come up to the knee and others also cover the thigh (you should only need knee-high stockings for varicose eczema)\ndifferent foot styles \u2013 some cover the whole foot and some stop before the toes\n\nSupport stockings or tights that lightly compress the legs can be bought from pharmacies. Compression stockings that compress the legs more are available on prescription and will require you to be measured by a nurse first.\nIn some cases, if you find it difficult to put on your stockings, you may be advised to use a tubular bandage instead.\nYou will usually need to put your compression stockings on as soon as you get up in the morning and take them off when you go to bed. Wearing compression stockings can be uncomfortable, particularly during hot weather, but it is important to wear them correctly to get the most benefit from them.\nPull them all the way up so that the correct level of compression is applied to each part of your leg. Do not let the stocking roll down, or it may dig into your skin in a tight band around your leg. Speak to your GP if the stockings are uncomfortable, they do not seem to fit, or you have difficulty putting them on. It may be possible to get custom-made stockings that will fit you exactly.\nTake care when\u00a0putting compression stockings on and taking them off,\u00a0as this\u00a0can damage fragile skin. If you have a leg ulcer, it ideally needs to heal before you start wearing compression stockings.\u00a0\u00a0\nCompression stockings usually have to be replaced every 3\u00a0to 6\u00a0months. Speak to your GP if your stockings become damaged, as they may no longer be effective.\u00a0  \u00a0 You should be prescribed 2\u00a0stockings (or 2\u00a0sets of stockings if you are wearing 1\u00a0on each leg) so that 1\u00a0stocking can be worn while the other is being washed and dried. Compression stockings should be hand-washed in warm water and dried away from direct heat.\nTreating varicose veins\nIf you have varicose veins,\u00a0as well as\u00a0varicose eczema, treating these may sometimes be helpful.\nIf your GP thinks treatment may be beneficial, they can refer you to a vascular surgeon, who can arrange for an ultrasound scan of your leg to find the faulty blood vessels. Treatment of your varicose veins can then be planned.\nThere are a number of treatments available that can improve the symptoms and appearance of varicose veins, including:\n\nendothermal ablation \u2013\u00a0where energy from either high-frequency radio waves or lasers is used\u00a0to seal the affected veins\nsclerotherapy \u2013 where a\u00a0special foam is injected\u00a0into your veins to seal them\nligation and stripping \u2013 where affected veins are tied off and surgically removed\n\nThese procedures are usually performed in the day surgery department of a hospital.\nRead more about\u00a0treating varicose veins.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "A leg ulcer is a long-lasting (chronic) sore that takes more than 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks to heal. They usually develop on the inside of the leg, just above the ankle.\nThe\u00a0symptoms of a venous leg ulcer include pain, itching and swelling in the affected leg. There may also be discoloured or hardened skin around the ulcer, and the sore may produce a foul-smelling discharge.\nSee your GP if you think you have a leg ulcer, as it will need specialist treatment to help it heal.\nYour GP will examine your leg and may carry out additional tests to rule out other conditions.\nRead more about how a venous leg ulcer is diagnosed.\nWhat causes venous leg ulcers?\nA venous leg ulcer is the most common type of leg ulcer, accounting for over 90% of all cases.\nVenous leg ulcers can develop after a minor injury, where persistently high pressure in the veins of the legs has damaged the skin.\nRead more about the causes of venous leg ulcers.\nWho's affected?\nVenous leg ulcers are estimated to affect around 1 in 500 people in the UK, although they become much more common with age. It's estimated that around 1 in 50 people over the age of 80 has one.\nYou're more at risk of developing one if you've previously had\u00a0deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or\u00a0find it difficult to\u00a0walk because of a problem such as:\n\nosteoarthritis\na leg injury\nobesity\nparalysis\n\nYou're also more at risk if\u00a0you've recently had an operation on your leg, such as a hip replacement\u00a0or knee replacement.\nPeople with\u00a0varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) also have a higher risk of developing venous leg ulcers.\nHow venous leg ulcers are treated\nMost venous leg ulcers heal within 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0months if they're treated by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers. However, some ulcers may take longer to heal, and a very small number never heal.\nTreatment usually involves:\n\ncleaning and dressing the wound\nusing compression, such as bandages or stockings, to improve the flow of blood in the legs\n\nAntibiotics\u00a0may also be used if the ulcer becomes infected, but they don't help ulcers to heal.\nHowever, unless the underlying cause of the ulcer is addressed, there's a high risk of a venous leg ulcer recurring after treatment. Underlying causes could include immobility, obesity, previous DVT, or varicose veins.\nRead more about treating venous leg ulcers.\nCan venous leg ulcers be prevented?\nThere are several ways to help prevent a venous leg ulcer in people at risk, such as:\u00a0\n\nwearing compression stockings\nlosing weight if you're overweight\nexercising regularly\nelevating your leg when possible\n\nThis is particularly important if you've previously had a leg ulcer \u2013 once a leg has suffered a venous ulcer, you're at risk of further ulcers developing within months or years.\nRead more about preventing venous leg ulcers.\n\n\nVenous leg ulcers are open, often painful, sores in the skin that take more than a month to heal.

If this happens, pressure inside the veins increases.\nThis constant high pressure can gradually damage the tiny blood vessels in your skin and make it fragile. As a result, your skin can easily break and form an ulcer after a knock or scratch.\nUnless you have treatment to improve the circulation in your legs, the ulcer\u00a0may not\u00a0heal.\nRead more about treating venous leg ulcers.\nWho's most at risk?\nA\u00a0number of factors can increase your risk of developing a venous leg ulcer, including:\n\nobesity\u00a0or being overweight \u2013\u00a0this increases the pressure in the leg veins\nif you have difficulty walking \u2013\u00a0this can weaken the calf muscles, which can affect circulation in the leg veins\nprevious deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \u2013\u00a0blood clots that develop in the leg can damage valves in\u00a0the veins\nvaricose veins\u00a0\u2013\u00a0swollen and enlarged veins caused by malfunctioning valves\nprevious injury to the leg, such as a broken or fractured bone, which may cause DVT or impair walking\nprevious surgery to the leg, such as a hip replacement or knee replacement, which can prevent you from moving about\nincreasing age \u2013 people find it harder to move around as they get older, particularly if they suffer from arthritis\n\n\n\nSee your GP if you think you have a venous leg ulcer. The ulcer is unlikely to heal without specialist treatment.\nDiagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and examination of your affected leg, although additional tests may be required.\nMedical history and examination\nYour GP or practice nurse will ask whether you have any other symptoms associated with venous leg ulcers, such as:\n\nswelling in your ankles\ndiscoloured or hard skin\n\nThey'll try to determine the cause of the ulcer by asking about underlying conditions or previous injuries, such as:\n\ndiabetes\ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT)\ninjury or surgery in the affected leg\na previous leg ulcer\n\nThey'll also examine your leg, both when you're standing up and lying down.\u00a0Varicose veins will be more obvious when you're standing up, and it will be easier to look at the ulcer when you're lying down.\nThey'll also feel your pulse at your ankles to make sure the arteries in your leg are working properly.\nDoppler study\nTo rule out\u00a0peripheral arterial disease\u00a0(a\u00a0condition affecting the arteries) as a\u00a0possible cause of your symptoms, your GP or nurse will carry out a test known as a Doppler study.\nThis involves measuring the blood pressure in the arteries at your ankles and comparing it\u00a0to the pressure in your arms.\u00a0If you have peripheral arterial disease, the blood pressure in your ankles will be lower than your arms.\nIt's important to carry out this check as the main treatment for venous ulcers is compression bandages or stockings to improve the\u00a0vein circulation in your legs. It's not safe to apply compression if the ankle artery pressures are low.\nRead more about how venous leg ulcers are treated.\nReferral to a specialist\nIn some cases, your GP or nurse may decide to refer you to\u00a0a specialist in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist).\nFor example, you may be referred to a vascular specialist if your GP or nurse is unsure about your diagnosis, or if they suspect your ulcer may be caused by artery diseases, diabetes\u00a0or rheumatoid arthritis.\nAfter taking your medical history and examining you, the vascular specialist may need to arrange further investigations to plan your treatment.\n\n\nWith appropriate treatment, most venous leg ulcers heal within 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0months.\nTreatment should always be carried out by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers. Usually, this will be a practice or district nurse.\nCleaning and dressing the ulcer\nThe first step is to remove any debris or dead tissue from the ulcer and apply an appropriate dressing. This provides the best conditions for the ulcer to heal.\nA simple, non-sticky dressing will be used to dress your ulcer. This usually needs to be changed once a week. Many people find they can manage cleaning and dressing their own ulcer under the supervision of a nurse.\nCompression\nTo improve vein circulation in your legs and treat swelling, your nurse will apply a firm compression bandage over the affected leg. These bandages are designed to squeeze your legs and encourage blood to flow upwards, towards your heart.\nThere are many different types of bandage\u00a0or elastic stockings used to treat venous leg ulcers, which\u00a0may be made\u00a0in 2, 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0different layers. The application of a compression bandage is a skilled procedure and they should only be applied by trained healthcare staff.\nThe bandage is changed once a week, when the dressing is changed.\nWhen compression bandages are first applied to an unhealthy ulcer, it's usually painful.\u00a0Ideally, you should have\u00a0paracetamol or an alternative painkiller prescribed by your GP.\u00a0The pain will lessen once the ulcer starts to heal, but this can take up to 10-12 days.\nIt's important to wear your compression bandage exactly as instructed. If you have any problems, it's usually best to contact your nurse, instead of trying to remove it yourself. If the compression bandage feels a little too tight and is uncomfortable in bed at night, getting up for a short walk will usually help.\nHowever,\u00a0you'll need to cut the bandage off if:\n\nyou get severe pain at the front of your ankle\nyou get severe pain on the top of your foot\nyour toes become blue and swollen\n\nOnce you remove the bandage,\u00a0make sure you keep your leg highly elevated and contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.\nIn some clinics, specialist teams are using new alternatives to compression bandages, such as special stockings or other compressive devices. These may not be available in every clinic but\u00a0could change the way ulcers are treated in future. Your specialist will be able to advise you whether a different approach may help you.\nTreating associated symptoms\nVenous leg ulcers are often accompanied by swelling of your feet and ankles (oedema), which is caused by fluid. This can be controlled by compression bandages.\nKeeping your leg elevated whenever possible, ideally with your toes at the same level as your eyes, will also help ease swelling. You should put a suitcase, sofa cushion or foam wedge under the bottom of your mattress, to help keep your legs raised while you sleep.\nYou should also keep as active as possible and aim to continue with your normal activities. Regular exercise, such as a daily walk, will help reduce leg swelling. However, you should avoid standing or sitting still with your feet down. You should elevate your feet at least every hour.\nSome people with venous leg ulcers develop rashes with scaly and itchy skin.\nThis is\u00a0often due to\u00a0varicose eczema, which can be treated with a moisturiser (emollient) and occasionally a mild corticosteroid cream or ointment. In\u00a0rare cases,\u00a0you may need to be referred to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for treatment.\nItchy skin can also sometimes be caused by an allergic reaction to the dressings or creams applied by your nurse. If this happens, you may need to be tested for allergies.\nIt's important to avoid scratching your legs if they feel itchy, because this damages the skin and may lead to further ulcers.\nLooking after yourself during\u00a0treatment\nTo help your ulcer heal more quickly, follow the advice below:\n\nTry to keep active by walking regularly. Sitting and standing still without elevating your legs can make venous leg ulcers and swelling worse\nWhenever you're sitting or lying down, keep your affected leg elevated \u2013 with\u00a0your\u00a0toes level with your eyes\nRegularly exercise your legs by moving your feet up and down, and rotating them at the ankles. This can help encourage better circulation\nIf you're overweight, try to reduce your weight with\u00a0a healthy diet and regular exercise\nStop smoking\u00a0\nModerate your alcohol consumption\nBe careful not to injure your affected leg, and wear comfortable, well-fitting footwear\n\nYou may also find it helpful to attend a local healthy leg club, such as those provided by the\u00a0Lindsay Leg Club Foundation, for support and advice.\nTreating an infected ulcer\nAn ulcer sometimes produces a large amount of discharge and becomes more painful. There may also be redness around the ulcer. These symptoms\u00a0and feeling unwell are signs of infection.\nIf your ulcer becomes infected, it should be cleaned and dressed as usual.\nYou should also elevate your leg most of the time and you'll be prescribed a 7-day course of\u00a0antibiotics.\nThe aim of antibiotic treatment is to\u00a0clear the infection. However, antibiotics don't heal ulcers and should only be used in short courses to treat\u00a0infected ulcers.\nFollow-up\nYou should visit your nurse once a week to have your dressings and compression bandages changed. They'll also monitor the ulcer to see how well it's healing. Once your ulcer is healing well, your nurse will see you less often.\nAfter the ulcer has healed\nOnce you've had a venous leg ulcer, another ulcer could develop within months or years.\nThe most effective method of preventing this is to wear compression stockings at all times when you're out of bed. Your nurse will help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself.\nVarious accessories are available to help you put them on and take them off.\nRead more about preventing venous leg ulcers.\n\n\nYou can help reduce your risk of developing a venous leg ulcer in several ways, such as wearing a compression stocking, losing weight and taking care of your skin.\nPeople most at risk of developing a venous leg ulcer are those who have previously had a leg ulcer.\nCompression stockings\nIf you've previously had a venous leg ulcer, or you're at risk of developing one,\u00a0treatment with\u00a0compression stockings may be recommended by your GP.\nThese stockings\u00a0are specially designed to squeeze your legs, improving your circulation. They're\u00a0usually tightest at the ankle and less tight further up your leg \u2013 this encourages blood to flow upwards, towards your heart.\nTo be most effective, these stockings should be put on as soon as you get up and only taken off at night.\nCompression stockings are available in a variety of sizes, colours, styles and pressures. A nurse can help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself. There are various accessories you can buy to help get the stockings on and off.\nLosing weight\nIf you're obese\u00a0or overweight, losing weight can help treat and prevent venous leg ulcers. Excess weight leads to high pressure in the veins in your legs, which can damage your skin. Venous ulcers are much more common among people who are overweight.\nTo help you lose weight, regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet are recommended. You should also avoid sitting or standing for long periods.\u00a0Elevating your legs whenever possible can also help.\nRead more\u00a0about:\n\nlosing weight\u00a0\nhealth and fitness\nhealthy eating\n\nTreating underlying problems\nTreating severe varicose veins\u00a0may help prevent leg swelling or ulcers. This may involve a procedure where a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is inserted into the affected veins with\u00a0high-frequency radio waves or lasers used to seal them.\nAlternatively, you may need surgery to repair the damage to your leg veins, or to remove the affected veins altogether.\nRead more about treating varicose veins.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself.

Your GP or the specialist treating you may advise you to:\n\ndo simple exercises to correct your symptoms\nsleep with your head slightly raised on two or more pillows\nget up slowly when getting out of bed and sit on the edge of the bed for a minute or so before standing\navoid bending down to pick up items\navoid extending your neck \u2013 for example, while reaching up to a high shelf\nmove your head carefully and slowly during daily activities\ndo exercises that trigger your vertigo, so your brain gets used to it and reduces the symptoms (do these only after making sure you won't fall, and have support if needed)\n\nFear of heights\nThe term vertigo is often incorrectly used to describe a fear of heights. The medical term for a fear of heights and the dizzy feeling associated with looking down from a high place is \"acrophobia\".\nRead more about phobias for advice and information.\n\n\nVertigo is a symptom of several different conditions. There are two types of vertigo, known as peripheral and central, depending on the cause.\nPeripheral vertigo\nPeripheral vertigo is the most common type,\u00a0often caused by a problem with the balance mechanisms of the inner ear. The most common causes include:\n\nbenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)\nhead injury\nlabyrinthitis\nvestibular neuronitis\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\ntaking\u00a0certain types of medication\n\nThese\u00a0causes\u00a0are explained in more detail below.\nThis is one of the most common causes of vertigo.\u00a0It can\u00a0occur during specific head movements, while standing up or bending over, crossing the road, or turning in bed.\nBPPV involves short, intense, recurrent attacks of vertigo (usually lasting a few seconds to a few minutes). It is often accompanied by nausea, although vomiting is rare.\u00a0You may\u00a0also\u00a0experience your eyes briefly moving\u00a0uncontrollably (nystagmus).\u00a0\nLightheadedness and a loss of balance can last for several minutes or hours after the attack.\nBPPV is thought to be caused by small fragments of debris (calcium carbonate crystals), which break off from the lining of the channels in your inner ear. The fragments don't usually cause a problem, unless they get into one of the ear's fluid-filled canals.\nWhen your head is still, the fragments sit at the bottom of the canal. However, certain head movements cause them to be swept along the fluid-filled canal, which sends confusing messages to your brain, causing vertigo.\nBPPV usually affects older people, with most cases occurring in people older than 50 years of age.\nBPPV may occur for no apparent reason, or it may develop after:\n\nan ear infection\near surgery\na head injury\nprolonged bed rest \u2013 for example, while recovering from an illness\n\nVertigo can sometimes develop after a head injury. If you have symptoms of\u00a0dizziness or vertigo following a head injury, seek medical attention.\nRead more about severe head injuries and minor head injuries\nLabyrinthitis\u00a0is an inner ear infection that causes a structure deep inside your ear (the labyrinth) to become inflamed. The labyrinth is a maze of fluid-filled channels that control hearing and balance.\nWhen the labyrinth becomes inflamed, the information it sends to your brain is different from the information sent from your unaffected ear and your eyes. These conflicting signals cause vertigo and dizziness.\nLabyrinthitis is usually caused by a viral infection, such as the\u00a0common cold or flu, which spreads to the labyrinth. Less commonly, it's caused by a bacterial infection.\nVertigo\u00a0caused by labyrinthitis may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting,\u00a0hearing loss, tinnitus and sometimes\u00a0a high temperature and ear pain.\nVestibular neuronitis, also known as vestibular neuritis, is an inner ear condition that causes inflammation of the nerve connecting the labyrinth to the brain. In some cases, the labyrinth itself can also be inflamed.\nThe condition\u00a0is usually caused by a viral infection. It usually comes on suddenly and can cause other symptoms, such as unsteadiness, nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting (being sick). You won't normally have any hearing problems.\nIt usually lasts a few hours or days, but it may take\u00a0three to\u00a0six weeks to settle completely.\nSevere vertigo is sometimes caused by a rare condition that affects the inner ear, called M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\u00a0This\u00a0can cause vertigo, as well as hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness (a feeling of pressure in your ear).\nIf you have M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, you may experience sudden attacks of vertigo that last\u00a0for hours or days. The attacks often cause nausea and vomiting.\nThe cause is unknown, but\u00a0symptoms can be controlled by diet and medication. Rarely, you may need further treatment in the form of surgery.\u00a0\nVertigo may occur as a side effect of some types of medication. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if vertigo is listed as a possible side effect.\nDon't stop taking prescribed medication without your doctor's advice, but speak to your GP if you're worried about the side effects. They may be able to prescribe an alternative medication.\nCentral vertigo\nCentral vertigo is caused by problems in part of your brain, such as the cerebellum (located at the bottom of the brain) or the brainstem (the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord). Causes of central vertigo include:\n\nmigraines \u2013 a severe headache that's usually felt as a throbbing pain at the front or on one side of your head, which is especially common in younger people\nmultiple sclerosis \u2013 a condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)\nacoustic neuroma \u2013 a rare, non-cancerous (benign) brain tumour that grows on the acoustic nerve, which is the nerve that helps to control hearing and balance\na brain tumour in the cerebellum, located at the bottom of the brain\na transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or a stroke \u2013 where part of the blood supply to the brain is cut off\ntaking certain types of medication\n\n\n\nYour GP will ask about your symptoms and carry out some simple tests to help them make an accurate diagnosis.\nIn some cases, you may be referred for some further tests.\nImportant questions\nYour GP will first want to know:\n\ndetails of the first episode of your symptoms and what they were\u00a0\u2013 for example, whether you felt lightheaded or if your surroundings were spinning\nif you also experience other symptoms\u00a0\u2013 such as hearing loss, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting or fullness in the ear\nhow often your symptoms occur and how long they last for\nif your symptoms are affecting your daily activities \u2013 for example, whether you're unable to walk during an episode of vertigo\nwhether anything triggers your symptoms or makes them worse, such as moving your head in a particular direction\nwhat makes your symptoms better\u00a0\n\nPhysical examination\nYour GP may also carry out a physical examination to check for signs of conditions that may be causing your vertigo. This could include looking inside your ears and checking your eyes for signs of uncontrollable movement (nystagmus).\nYour GP may check your balance or try to recreate your symptoms by asking you to move quickly from a sitting to a lying position.\nFurther tests\nDepending on your symptoms, your GP\u00a0may refer you\u00a0to a hospital or specialist for further tests.\nIf you have\u00a0tinnitus (ringing in your ears) or hearing loss, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, who can carry out\u00a0some hearing tests.\nThese\u00a0may include:\n\nan audiometry test \u2013 a machine called an audiometer produces sounds of different volume and pitch. You listen to the sounds through headphones and signal when you hear a sound, either by raising your hand or pressing a button.\ntuning fork test \u2013 a tuning fork produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it's gently tapped. The tester will tap the tuning fork before holding it at each side of your head.\n\nRead more\u00a0about how hearing tests are carried out.\nVideonystagmography (VNG)\u00a0is sometimes\u00a0used to check for signs of nystagmus in more detail. Nystagmus can\u00a0indicate\u00a0a problem with\u00a0the organs that help you to balance.\nDuring this test, special goggles are placed over your eyes and you'll be asked to look at various still and moving targets. The goggles are fitted with a video camera to record the movements of your eyes.\nElectronystagmography may also be used, where electrodes are placed around the eye instead of goggles.\nA\u00a0caloric test\u00a0involves running warm or cool water or air into your ear for about 30 seconds.\u00a0The change in temperature stimulates the balance organ in the ear,\u00a0allowing the specialist to check how well it's working.\nThis test isn't painful, although it's normal to\u00a0feel dizzy during the test. This can sometimes continue for a\u00a0few\u00a0minutes afterwards.\nA machine to test your balance may be used to give valuable information about how you are using your vision, proprioception (sensations from your feet and joints) and\u00a0the input from your ear to maintain balance. This may help to plan your rehabilitation and\u00a0monitor your treatment.\nIn some cases, a scan of your head may be used to look for the cause of your vertigo, such as an acoustic neuroma (a non-cancerous brain tumour).\nUsually, either\u00a0a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or\u00a0a computerised tomography (CT) scan is used. An MRI scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of your head, whereas\u00a0a CT scan uses a series of\u00a0detailed X-rays to create an image.\n\n\nTreatment for vertigo depends on the cause and severity of your symptoms.\nDuring a vertigo attack, lying still in a quiet, darkened room may help to ease any symptoms of nausea and reduce the sensation of spinning. You may be advised to take medication.\nYou should also try to avoid stressful situations, as anxiety can make the symptoms of vertigo worse.\nRead more about\u00a0what to do if you're struggling with stress\nLabyrinthitis\nLabyrinthitis is an inner ear infection that causes the labyrinth (a delicate structure deep inside your ear) to become inflamed. It's usually caused by a viral infection and clears up on its own without treatment. In rare cases, where labyrinthitis is caused by a bacterial infection,\u00a0antibiotics may be prescribed.\nIf you've experienced any hearing loss, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiovestibular physician. This is a doctor who specialises in hearing and balance disorders. You may need emergency treatment to restore your hearing.\nLabyrinthitis may also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation\u00a0\u2013 also called vestibular rehabilitation training or VRT (see below).\nSee treating labyrinthitis for more information\nVestibular neuronitis\nVestibular neuronitis, also known as vestibular neuritis, is inflammation of the vestibular nerve (one of the nerves in your ear that's used for balance). It's usually caused by a viral infection.\nThe symptoms of vestibular neuronitis\u00a0often get better without treatment\u00a0over several weeks. However, you may need to rest in bed if your symptoms are severe. See your GP if your symptoms get worse or don't start to improve after a week.\nYou may find your balance is particularly affected if you:\n\ndrink alcohol\nare tired\nhave another illness\n\nAvoiding these can help to improve your condition.\nVestibular neuronitis can also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation and medication.\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)\nLike vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) often clears up without treatment after several weeks or months. It's thought that the small fragments of debris in the ear canal that cause vertigo either dissolve or become lodged in a place where they\u00a0no longer\u00a0cause symptoms.\u00a0BPPV can sometimes return.\nUntil the symptoms disappear or the condition is treated, you should:\n\nget out of bed slowly\navoid activities that involve looking upwards, such as painting and decorating or looking for something on a high shelf\n\nBPPV can be treated using a procedure called the Epley manoeuvre.\nThe Epley manoeuvre involves performing four separate head movements to move the fragments that cause vertigo\u00a0to a place where they no longer\u00a0cause symptoms. Each head position is held for at least 30 seconds. You may experience some vertigo during the movements.\nYour symptoms should improve shortly after the Epley manoeuvre is performed, although it may take up to two weeks for a complete recovery. Return to your GP if your symptoms haven't improved after four weeks. The Epley manoeuvre isn't usually a long-term cure and may need to\u00a0be repeated.\nIf the Epley manoeuvre doesn't work, or if it's not suitable \u2013 for example, because you have neck or back problems\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you can also\u00a0try Brandt-Daroff exercises. These are a series of movements\u00a0you can do unsupervised at home.\nYour GP will need to teach you how to do the exercises. You repeat them three or four times a day for two days in a row. Your symptoms may improve for up to two weeks.\nYour GP may refer you to a specialist, such as an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if:\n\nthe Epley manoeuvre doesn't work or can't be performed\nyou still have symptoms after four weeks\nyou have unusual signs or symptoms\n\nIn rare cases, where the symptoms of vertigo last for months or years, surgery may be recommended. This may involve blocking one of the fluid-filled canals in your ear. Your ENT specialist\u00a0can give more advice on this.\nM\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\nIf your vertigo is caused by M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, there are a number of treatment options\u00a0for both the vertigo and other symptoms caused by the condition.\nPossible treatments for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease include:\n\ndietary advice\u00a0\u2013 particularly a low-salt diet\nmedication to treat attacks of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\nmedication to prevent attacks of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\ntreatment for\u00a0tinnitus (ringing in your ears)\u00a0\u2013 such as sound therapy,\u00a0which works by reducing the difference between tinnitus sounds and background sounds, to make the tinnitus sounds less intrusive\ntreatment for hearing loss\u00a0\u2013 such as using hearing aids\nphysiotherapy to deal with balance problems\ntreatment for the secondary symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\u00a0\u2013 such as stress, anxiety and depression\n\nSee treating M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease for more information\nCentral vertigo\nCentral vertigo is caused by problems in part of your brain, such as the cerebellum (which is located at the bottom of the brain) or the brainstem (the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord).\nCauses of central vertigo include\u00a0migraines and, less commonly,\u00a0brain tumours.\nIf your GP suspects\u00a0you have central vertigo, they may organise a\u00a0scan or refer you to a hospital specialist,\u00a0such as a neurologist or an ENT (ear, nose and throat specialist) or audiovestibular physician.\nTreating your migraine should relieve your vertigo if it's caused by a migraine.\nVertigo with an unknown cause\nIf the cause of your vertigo is unknown, you may be admitted to hospital if:\n\nyou have severe nausea and vomiting, and can't keep fluids down\nyour vertigo comes on suddenly and wasn't caused by you changing position\nyou possibly have central vertigo\nyou have sudden hearing loss, but it's not thought to be M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\n\nAlternatively, you may be referred to a specialist, such as:\n\na neurologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the nervous system\nan ENT specialist \u2013 a specialist in conditions that affect the ear, nose or throat\nan audiovestibular physician \u2013 a specialist in hearing and balance disorders\n\nWhile waiting to see a specialist, you may be treated with medication.\u00a0\nVestibular rehabilitation\nVestibular rehabilitation, also called vestibular rehabilitation training or VRT, is a form of \"brain retraining\". It involves carrying out a special programme of exercises that encourage your brain to adapt to the abnormal messages sent from your ears.\nDuring VRT, you keep moving despite feelings of dizziness and vertigo. Your brain should eventually learn to rely on the signals coming from the rest of your body, such as your eyes and legs, rather than the confusing signals coming from your inner ear. By relying on other signals, your brain minimises any dizziness and helps you to maintain your balance.\nAn audiologist (hearing specialist) or a physiotherapist\u00a0may provide VRT. Your GP may be able to refer you for VRT, although it depends on availability in your\u00a0area.\nIn some cases,\u00a0it\u00a0may be possible to\u00a0use VRT without specialist help. Research has shown that\u00a0people with some types of vertigo can improve their symptoms using a self-help\u00a0VRT booklet. However, you should discuss this with your doctor first.\nMedicines\nMedication can be used to treat\u00a0episodes of vertigo caused by vestibular neuronitis\u00a0or\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. It may also be used for central vertigo or vertigo with an unknown cause.\nThe medicines are usually prescribed for\u00a03\u00a0to 14 days, depending on which condition they're for. The two medicines that are usually prescribed are:\n\nprochlorperazine\nantihistamines\n\nIf these medicines are successful in treating your symptoms, you may be given a supply to keep at home, so you can take them the next time you have an episode of vertigo.\nIn some cases you may be advised to take long-term medication, such as betahistine, for conditions like M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\nProchlorperazine can help relieve\u00a0severe nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo. It works by blocking the effect of a chemical in the brain called dopamine.\nProchlorperazine can cause side effects, including tremors (shaking) and abnormal or involuntary body and facial movements.\nIt can also make some people feel sleepy. For the full list of possible side effects, check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine.\nAntihistamines can be used to help relieve less severe nausea, vomiting and vertigo symptoms. They work by blocking the effects of a\u00a0chemical called histamine.\nPossible antihistamines that may be prescribed include:\n\ncinnarizine\ncyclizine\npromethazine teoclate\n\nLike prochlorperazine, antihistamines can also make you feel sleepy. Headaches and an upset stomach are also possible side effects. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects.\nA medication called betahistine works in a similar way to antihistamines. It has been used to treat M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and may also be used for other balance problems. It may have to be taken for a long period of time. The beneficial effects vary from person to person.\nIf you have vertigo, there are some safety issues\u00a0to consider. For example:\n\nyou should inform your employer if your job involves operating machinery or climbing ladders\nyou may be at increased risk of falls \u2013 see preventing falls for advice\u00a0on making your home safer and reducing your risk\n\nVertigo could also affect your ability to drive. You should avoid driving if you've recently had episodes of vertigo and there's a chance you may have another episode while you're driving.\nIt's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could affect your driving ability. Visit the GOV.UK website for more information on driving with a disability.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Vitamin B12 or B9 (commonly called folate) deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of vitamin B12 or folate causes the body to produce abnormally large red blood cells that can't function properly.\nRed blood cells carry oxygen around the body using a substance called haemoglobin.\nAnaemia is the general term\u00a0for having either fewer red blood cells than normal or having an abnormally low amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell.\nThere are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. For example, iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs\u00a0when the body doesn't contain enough iron.\nSymptoms of vitamin B12\u00a0or folate deficiency\nVitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy.\nA deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including:\n\nextreme tiredness\na lack of energy\npins and needles (paraesthesia)\na sore and red tongue\nmouth ulcers\nmuscle weakness\ndisturbed vision\npsychological problems, which may include depression\u00a0and\u00a0confusion\u00a0\nproblems with\u00a0memory, understanding and judgement\n\nSome of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don't have anaemia.\nRead about the symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a\u00a0blood test.\nIt's important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible because, although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible.\nRead about\u00a0diagnosing vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nCauses of a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency\nThere are a number of problems that can lead to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, including:\n\npernicious anaemia \u2013 where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach, preventing your body from absorbing vitamin B12 from the food you eat; this\u00a0is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK\na lack of these vitamins in your diet \u2013 this is uncommon, but can occur if you have a vegan diet, follow a fad diet or have a generally poor diet for a long time\nmedication \u2013 certain medications, including anticonvulsants and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can affect how much of these vitamins your body absorbs\u00a0\n\nBoth vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency are more common in older people, affecting around 1 in 10 people aged 75 or over, and 1 in 20 people aged 65 to 74.\nRead about the causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nTreating vitamin B12 or folate\u00a0deficiency anaemia\nMost cases of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency can be\u00a0easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the\u00a0missing vitamins.\nVitamin B12 supplements are usually given by injection at first. Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you'll either require B12 tablets between meals\u00a0or regular injections. These treatments may be needed for the rest of your life.\nFolic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for four months.\nIn some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it recurring. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs,\u00a0dairy products, yeast extract (such as Marmite) and specially fortified foods. The best sources of folate include green vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts and peas.\nRead about treating vitamin B12 or folate deficiency\nComplications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nAlthough it's uncommon, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (with or without anaemia) can lead to complications, particularly if you've been deficient in vitamin B12 or folate for some time.\nPotential complications can include:\n\nproblems with the nervous system\ntemporary infertility\nheart conditions\npregnancy complications and birth defects\n\nAdults with severe anaemia are also at risk of developing heart failure.\nSome\u00a0complications improve with appropriate treatment, but others \u2013 such as problems with the nervous system \u2013 can be permanent.\u00a0\nRead about the complications of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\n\n\nVitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can cause a wide range of symptoms. These usually develop gradually but can worsen if the condition goes untreated.\nAnaemia is where\u00a0you have fewer red blood cells than normal or\u00a0you have\u00a0an abnormally low amount\u00a0of a substance called haemoglobin in each red blood cell. General symptoms of anaemia may include:\n\nextreme tiredness (fatigue)\nlack of energy (lethargy)\nbreathlessness\nfeeling faint\nheadaches\npale skin\nnoticeable heartbeats (palpitations)\nhearing sounds\u00a0coming from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus)\nloss of appetite and weight loss\n\nSymptoms of vitamin B12\u00a0deficiency\nIf you have anaemia caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you may have other\u00a0symptoms in addition to those listed above, such as:\n\na pale yellow tinge to your skin\na sore and red tongue (glossitis)\nmouth ulcers\npins and needles (paraesthesia)\nchanges in the way that you walk and move around\ndisturbed vision\nirritability\ndepression\nchanges in the\u00a0way you think, feel and behave\na decline in your mental abilities, such as\u00a0memory, understanding and judgement (dementia)\n\nSome of these symptoms can also occur in people who have a vitamin B12 deficiency, but have not developed anaemia.\nSymptoms of folate deficiency\nAdditional symptoms in people with\u00a0anaemia caused by a folate deficiency can include:\n\nsymptoms related to anaemia\nreduced sense of taste\ndiarrhoea\nnumbness and tingling in the feet and hands\nmuscle weakness\ndepression\n\nWhen to see your GP\nSee your GP if you're experiencing symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia.\u00a0These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test.\nRead more about diagnosing\u00a0vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia\nIt's important for\u00a0vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible if left untreated. The longer the condition goes untreated, the higher the chance of permanent damage.\n\n\nVitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of either of these vitamins affects the body's ability to produce fully functioning red blood cells.\nRed blood cells carry oxygen around the body. Most people with\u00a0vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia have underdeveloped red blood cells that are\u00a0larger than normal. The medical term for this is \"megaloblastic anaemia\".\nA vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can be the result of a variety of problems, some of which are described below.\nCauses of vitamin B12 deficiency\nPernicious anaemia is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.\nPernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition that affects your stomach. An autoimmune condition means\u00a0your\u00a0immune system (the body's natural defence system that protects against illness and infection) attacks your body's healthy cells.\nIn your stomach, vitamin B12\u00a0is combined with\u00a0a\u00a0protein called intrinsic factor. This mix of vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor is then absorbed into the body in part of the gut called the distal ileum.\nPernicious anaemia causes your immune system to attack the cells in your stomach that produce the intrinsic factor, which means\u00a0your body is unable to absorb vitamin B12.\nThe exact cause\u00a0of pernicious anaemia is unknown, but the condition is more common in\u00a0women around 60 years of age, people with a family history of the condition and those with another autoimmune condition, such as\u00a0Addison's disease or\u00a0vitiligo.\nSome people can develop a vitamin B12 deficiency as a result of not getting enough vitamin B12 from their diet.\nA diet that includes meat, fish and dairy products usually provides enough vitamin B12, but people who don't regularly eat these foods \u2013 such as those following a\u00a0vegan diet or who have\u00a0a generally\u00a0very poor diet \u2013 can become deficient.\nStores of vitamin B12 in the body can\u00a0last\u00a0around two to four years without being replenished, so it can take a long time for\u00a0any problems to develop after a dietary change.\nSome stomach conditions or stomach operations can prevent the absorption of\u00a0enough vitamin B12.\nFor example, a\u00a0gastrectomy (a surgical procedure where part of your stomach is removed) increases your risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency.\nSome conditions that affect your intestines\u00a0can also\u00a0stop you from absorbing the necessary amount of vitamin B12.\nFor example, Crohn's disease\u00a0(a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes mean your body doesn't\u00a0get enough vitamin B12.\nSome types of medicine can lead to a reduction in\u00a0the amount of vitamin B12 in your body.\nFor example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \u2013 a medication sometimes used to\u00a0treat indigestion \u2013 can make a vitamin B12 deficiency worse. PPIs inhibit the production of stomach acid, which is needed to release vitamin B12 from the food you eat.\nYour GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your vitamin B12 levels and will monitor you if necessary.\nSome people can experience problems related to a vitamin B12 deficiency, despite appearing to have normal levels of vitamin B12 in their blood.\nThis can occur due to a problem known as functional vitamin B12 deficiency \u2013 where there's a problem with the proteins that help transport vitamin B12 between cells. This results in\u00a0neurological complications involving the spinal cord.\nCauses of folate deficiency\nFolate dissolves in water, which means your body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Your body's store of folate is usually enough to last four months. This means you need folate in your daily diet to ensure your body has sufficient stores of the vitamin.\nLike vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia, folate deficiency anaemia can develop for a number of reasons. Some are described below.\nGood\u00a0sources of folate include\u00a0broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chickpeas and brown rice. If you don't regularly eat these types of foods, you may develop a folate deficiency.\nFolate deficiency caused by a lack of dietary folate is more common in people who have a generally unbalanced and unhealthy diet, people who regularly misuse alcohol and people following a fad diet that doesn't involve eating good sources of folate.\nSometimes your body may be unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually due to an underlying condition affecting your digestive system, such as\u00a0coeliac disease.\nYou may lose folate from your body if you urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of your organs, such as:\n\ncongestive heart failure \u2013 where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body\nacute liver damage \u2013 often caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\nlong-term\u00a0dialysis \u2013 where a machine that replicates the kidney function is used to filter waste products from the blood\n\nSome types of medicine reduce the amount of folate in your body, or make the folate harder to absorb.\nThese include some\u00a0anticonvulsants (medication used to treat epilepsy), colestyramine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate.\nYour GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your folate levels and will monitor you if necessary.\nYour body sometimes requires more folate than normal. This can cause folate deficiency\u00a0if you can't meet your body's demands for the vitamin.\nYour body may need more folate than usual if you:\n\nare pregnant (see below)\nhave cancer\nhave a blood disorder \u2013 such as\u00a0sickle cell anaemia (an inherited blood disorder which causes red blood cells to develop abnormally)\nare fighting an infection or health condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling)\n\nPremature babies (born before the 37th week\u00a0of pregnancy) are also more\u00a0likely to develop a folate deficiency, because their developing bodies require higher amounts of folate than normal.\nIf you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, it's recommended that you take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day until you're 12 weeks pregnant. This will ensure that both you and your baby have enough folate and help your baby grow and develop.\nFolic acid tablets are available with a prescription from your GP, or you can buy them over the counter from pharmacies, large supermarkets and health food stores.\nIf you're pregnant and have another condition that may increase your body's need for folate, such as those mentioned above, your GP will monitor you closely to prevent you from becoming anaemic.\nIn some cases, you may need a higher dose of folic acid. For example, if you have diabetes, you should take a 5 milligrams (5mg) supplement of folic acid instead of the standard 400 micrograms.\nRead more about vitamins and minerals in pregnancy\n\n\nA diagnosis of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can often be made by your GP based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests.\nBlood tests\nDifferent types of\u00a0blood tests can be carried out to\u00a0help identify people with a possible\u00a0vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These tests check:\n\nwhether you have a lower level of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen)\u00a0than normal\nwhether your red blood cells are larger than normal\nthe level of vitamin B12 in your blood\nthe level\u00a0of\u00a0folate in your blood\n\nHowever, some people can have problems with their normal levels of these vitamins\u00a0or may\u00a0have low levels despite having no symptoms.\u00a0This is why it's important for your symptoms to be taken into account when a diagnosis is made.\nA particular drawback of testing vitamin B12 levels is that the current widely-used blood test only measures the total amount of vitamin B12 in your blood.\nThis means\u00a0it measures\u00a0forms of vitamin B12 that are \"active\" and can be used by your body, as well as the \"inactive\" forms, which can't. If a significant amount of the vitamin B12 in your blood is \"inactive\", a blood test may show that you have normal B12 levels,\u00a0even though your body can't use much of it.\nThere are some types of blood test that\u00a0may help determine if the vitamin B12 in your blood can be used by your body, but these aren't yet widely available.\nIdentifying the cause\nIf your symptoms and blood test results suggest a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, your GP may arrange further tests. If the cause can be identified,\u00a0it will\u00a0help\u00a0to determine the most appropriate treatment.\nFor example,\u00a0you may have additional blood tests to check for a condition called pernicious anaemia. This is an autoimmune condition (where your immune system produces antibodies to attack healthy cells), which means you're unable to absorb vitamin B12 from the food you eat.\nTests for pernicious anaemia aren't always conclusive, but they can often\u00a0give your GP a good idea of whether you have the condition.\nReferral to a specialist\nYou may be referred to a specialist for further tests or treatment. This may include:\n\na\u00a0haematologist (specialist in treating blood conditions) \u2013\u00a0if you have vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia and your GP is uncertain of the cause, you're pregnant or symptoms suggest your nervous system has been affected\na\u00a0gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions that affect the digestive system) \u2013\u00a0if your GP suspects you don't have enough vitamin B12 or folate because your digestive system isn't absorbing it properly\na\u00a0dietitian (specialist in nutrition) \u2013 if your GP suspects you\u00a0have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency caused by a poor diet\n\nA\u00a0dietitian can devise a personalised eating plan for you to increase the amount of vitamin B12 or folate in your diet.\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe treatment for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia depends on what's causing the condition. Most people can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins.\nTreating vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia\nVitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is usually treated with injections of vitamin B12, in a form called hydroxocobalamin.\nAt first, you'll have these injections every other day for two weeks, or until your symptoms have stopped improving. Your GP or nurse will give the injections.\nAfter this initial\u00a0period, your\u00a0treatment will depend on whether the cause of your vitamin B12 deficiency is related to your diet. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK is pernicious anaemia, which isn't related to your diet.\nRead more about the causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency\nIf your vitamin B12 deficiency is caused by a lack of the vitamin in your diet, you may be prescribed vitamin B12 tablets to take every day between meals. Alternatively, you may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year.\nPeople who find it difficult to get enough vitamin B12 in their diets, such as\u00a0those following a vegan diet, may need vitamin B12 tablets for life.\nAlthough it's less common, people\u00a0with vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a prolonged poor diet may be advised\u00a0to stop taking the tablets once their vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal and\u00a0their diet has improved.\nGood sources of vitamin B12 include:\n\nmeat\nsalmon and cod\nmilk and other dairy products\neggs\n\nIf you're a vegetarian and vegan, or\u00a0are looking for alternatives to meat and dairy products, there are other foods that contain vitamin B12, such as yeast extract (including Marmite), as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and soy products.\nCheck the nutrition labels while food shopping to see how much vitamin B12\u00a0different foods contain.\nIf your vitamin B12 deficiency isn't caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in your diet, you'll usually need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every three months for the rest of your life.\nIf you've had neurological symptoms (symptoms that affect your nervous system, such as numbness\u00a0or tingling in your hands and feet) caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you'll be referred to a haematologist, and you may need to have injections every two months. Your haematologist will advise\u00a0on\u00a0how long you need to keep taking the injections.\nFor\u00a0injections of vitamin B12 given in the UK, hydroxocobalamin is preferred to an alternative called cyanocobalamin. This is because hydroxocobalamin stays in the body for longer.\nIf you need regular injections of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin\u00a0would need to be given once a month, whereas hydroxocobalamin can be given every three months.\nCyanocobalamin injections aren't routinely available on the NHS. However, if you need replacement tablets of vitamin B12, these will be cyanocobalamin.\nTreating folate deficiency anaemia\nTo treat folate deficiency anaemia, your GP will usually prescribe daily folic acid\u00a0tablets to build up your folate levels. They may also give you\u00a0dietary advice so you can increase your folate intake.\nGood sources of folate include:\n\nbroccoli\nBrussels sprouts\nasparagus\npeas\nchickpeas\nbrown rice\n\nMost people need to take folic acid tablets for about four months. However, if the underlying cause of your folate deficiency anaemia continues, you may have to take folic acid tablets for longer \u2013 possibly for life.\nBefore you start taking folic acid, your GP will check your vitamin B12 levels to make sure they're normal. This is because folic acid treatment can sometimes improve your symptoms so much that it masks an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency.\nIf a vitamin B12 deficiency isn't detected and treated, it could affect your nervous system.\nMonitoring your condition\nTo ensure your treatment is working, you may need to have further\u00a0blood tests.\nA\u00a0blood test is often carried out around 10-14 days after starting treatment to assess whether treatment is working. This\u00a0is to check your haemoglobin level and the number of the immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in your blood.\nAnother blood test may also be carried out after approximately eight weeks to confirm your treatment has been successful.\nIf you've been taking folic acid tablets, you may be tested again once the treatment has finished (usually after four months).\nMost people who have had a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency won't need further monitoring unless their symptoms return, or their treatment is ineffective. If your GP feels\u00a0it's necessary, you may have to return for an annual blood test to see whether your condition has returned.\n\n\nAs most cases of vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency can be easily and effectively treated, complications are rare.\nHowever, complications can occasionally develop, particularly if you've been deficient\u00a0in either vitamin\u00a0for some time.\nAnaemia complications\nAll types of anaemia, regardless of the cause, can lead to heart and lung complications as the heart struggles to pump oxygen to the vital organs.\nAdults with severe anaemia are at risk of developing:\n\nan abnormally fast heart beat\u00a0(tachycardia)\nheart failure \u2013 where the heart fails to pump enough blood around the body at the right pressure\n\nA lack of vitamin B12 (with or without anaemia) can cause the following complications:\nA lack of vitamin B12 can cause neurological problems (issues affecting your nervous system), such as:\n\nvision problems\nmemory loss\npins and needles (paraesthesia)\nloss of physical coordination (ataxia), which can affect your whole body and cause difficulty speaking or walking\ndamage to parts of the nervous system (peripheral neuropathy), particularly in the legs\n\nIf neurological problems do develop, they may be irreversible.\nVitamin B12 deficiency can sometimes\u00a0lead to temporary infertility (an inability to conceive). This\u00a0usually improves with appropriate vitamin B12 treatment.\nIf you have a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anaemia (a condition where your immune system attacks healthy cells in your stomach), your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased.\nIf you're pregnant, not having enough vitamin B12 can increase the risk of your baby developing a serious birth defect known as a\u00a0neural tube defect. The neural tube is a narrow channel that eventually\u00a0forms the brain and spinal cord.\u00a0\nExamples of neural tube defects include:\n\nspina bifida \u2013 where the baby's spine doesn't develop properly\nanencephaly \u2013 where\u00a0a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull\nencephalocele \u2013 where a membrane or skin-covered sac containing part of the brain pushes out of a hole in the skull\n\nComplications of folate deficiency\nA lack of folate (with or without anaemia) can also cause complications, some of which are outlined below.\nAs with a lack of vitamin B12, a folate deficiency can also affect your fertility. However,\u00a0this is only temporary and can usually be reversed\u00a0with folate supplements.\nResearch has shown\u00a0a lack of folate in your body may increase your risk of\u00a0cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nCVD is a general term that describes a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as\u00a0coronary heart disease (CHD).\nResearch has shown that folate deficiency can increase your risk of some cancers, such as\u00a0colon cancer.\nA\u00a0lack of folate during pregnancy may increase the risk of the baby being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or having a low birthweight.\nThe risk of\u00a0placental abruption may also be increased. This\u00a0is a serious condition where the placenta starts to come away from the inside of the womb wall, causing\u00a0tummy (abdominal) pain and bleeding from the vagina.\nAs with a vitamin B12 deficiency, a lack of folate can also affect an unborn baby's growth and development in the womb (uterus). This increases the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida developing in the unborn baby.\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Cancer of the vulva is a rare type of cancer that affects women and anyone with a vulva.\nThe vulva is a woman's external genitals. It includes\u00a0the lips surrounding the vagina (labia minora and labia majora), the clitoris (sexual organ\u00a0that helps reach sexual climax), and the Bartholin's glands (2\u00a0small glands each side of the vagina).\nMost of those affected by vulval cancer are older women and anyone with a vulva over the age of 65. The condition is rare in women and anyone with a vulva under 50 who have not yet gone through the menopause.\nSymptoms of vulval cancer\nSymptoms of vulval cancer can include:\n\na persistent itch in the vulva\npain, soreness or tenderness\u00a0in\u00a0the vulva\nraised and thickened patches of skin that can\u00a0be red, white or dark\na lump or wart-like growth on the vulva\nbleeding from the vulva or\u00a0blood-stained\u00a0vaginal discharge between periods\nan open sore in the vulva\na burning pain\u00a0when passing urine\na\u00a0mole on the vulva that changes shape or colour\n\nSpeak to your GP if you notice any changes in the usual appearance of your vulva. While it's highly unlikely to be the result of\u00a0cancer, these changes should be investigated.\nRead more about diagnosing vulval cancer.\nWhat causes vulval cancer?\nThe exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but your risk of developing the condition\u00a0is increased by the following factors:\n\nincreasing age\nvulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) \u2013 where the cells\u00a0in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous\npersistent infection with certain versions\u00a0of the\u00a0human papilloma virus (HPV)\nskin conditions affecting the vulva,\u00a0such as\u00a0lichen sclerosus\nsmoking\n\nYou may be able to reduce your risk of vulval cancer by stopping smoking and taking steps to reduce the chances of picking up an HPV infection.\nRead more about the causes of vulval cancer.\nHow vulval cancer is treated\nThe main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells.\nSome people may also have radiotherapy (where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells) or chemotherapy\u00a0(where medication is used to kill cancer cells), or both.\nRadiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you're not well enough to have an operation, or if\u00a0the cancer has spread and it isn't possible to remove it all.\nRead more about treating vulval cancer.\nCan\u00a0vulval cancer be prevented?\nIt's not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by:\n\npractising\u00a0safer sex\u00a0\u2013 using a condom during sex can offer some protection against HPV\nattending\u00a0cervical screening\u00a0appointments\u00a0\u2013\u00a0cervical screening can detect HPV and pre-cancerous conditions such as VIN\nstopping smoking\n\nThe\u00a0HPV vaccination\u00a0may also reduce your chances of developing vulval cancer. This is offered to all girls\u00a0who are 12 to 13 years old as part of their routine childhood immunisation programme.\n\n\nCancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.\nThe exact reason why this happens in cases of vulval cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition.\nThese include:\n\nincreasing age\nvulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)\nhuman papilloma virus (HPV) infection\nskin conditions that can affect the vulva, such as\u00a0lichen sclerosus\nsmoking\n\nIncreasing age\nThe risk of developing vulval cancer increases as you get older. Most cases develop in women and anyone with a vulva aged 65 or over. Very occasionally women and anyone with a vulva under 50 can be affected.\nVulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN)\nVulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pre-cancerous condition. This means\u00a0there are changes to certain cells in the vulva that aren't cancerous, but\u00a0could potentially turn into cancer at a later date. This is a gradual process that\u00a0usually takes well over 10 years.\nIn some cases, the abnormal cells may go away by themselves. However, because of the risk of cancer, treatment to remove the affected cells is often recommended.\nSymptoms of\u00a0VIN\u00a0are similar to those of vulval cancer, and include persistent itchiness\u00a0of the vulva and raised discoloured patches. Speak to your GP if you have these symptoms.\nThere are 2\u00a0types of\u00a0VIN:\n\nusual or undifferentiated VIN \u2013 this\u00a0usually affects\u00a0women and anyone with a vulva under 50 and is thought to be caused by an HPV infection\ndifferentiated VIN (dVIN) \u2013 this is a rarer type, usually affecting women and anyone with a vulva over 60, associated with skin conditions that affect the vulva\n\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV)\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat.\u00a0It's spread during sex, including anal and oral sex.\nThere are many different types of HPV, and most\u00a0people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn't lead to further problems.\nHowever, HPV is present in at least 40% of people with vulval cancer, which suggests it may increase your risk of developing the condition. HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer. It's thought the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vulva, which is\u00a0known as VIN.\nSkin conditions\nSeveral skin conditions can affect the vulva. In a small number of cases these are associated with an increased\u00a0risk of vulval cancer.\nTwo of the main conditions associated with vulval cancer are lichen sclerosus and\u00a0lichen planus. Both of these conditions cause the vulva to become itchy, sore and discoloured.\nIt's estimated that less than 5% of those who develop one of these conditions will go on to develop vulval cancer. It's not clear whether treating these conditions reduces this risk.\nSmoking\nSmoking increases your risk of developing VIN and vulval cancer. This may be because\u00a0smoking makes the immune system less effective, and less able to clear the HPV virus from your body and more vulnerable to the effects of the virus.\n\n\nSpeak to your GP if you notice any changes in the normal appearance of your vulva.\nYour GP will ask you about your symptoms, look at your medical history, and\u00a0examine your vulva to look for any lumps or unusual areas of skin.\nIf you would prefer to be examined by a\u00a0female doctor or you would like a nurse present during the examination, it may help to let your GP practice know in advance of your appointment.\nReferral to a gynaecologist\nIf your GP feels some further tests are necessary, they will refer you to a hospital specialist called a gynaecologist. A gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained vulval lump or\u00a0ulcer, or unexplained bleeding.\nThe gynaecologist\u00a0will\u00a0ask\u00a0about your symptoms and examine your vulva again, and they may recommend\u00a0a\u00a0test called a biopsy to determine whether you do have cancer.\u00a0\nA\u00a0biopsy\u00a0is where\u00a0a small sample of\u00a0tissue is removed so it can be examined under a microscope to see if the cells are cancerous.\nThis is often done\u00a0after a\u00a0local anaesthetic has been given to numb the area, which\u00a0means the procedure shouldn't be painful and you can go home the same day. Occasionally, it may be done under\u00a0general anaesthetic (where you're asleep), which may require an overnight stay in hospital.\nYour doctor may put a few stitches in the area where the biopsy was taken from.\u00a0You may have slight bleeding and soreness for a few days afterwards.\nYour doctor will usually see you 7\u00a0to 10 days later to discuss the results with you.\nIf the results of the biopsy show cancer, you may need further tests to assess how widespread it is.\nThese may include:\n\na colposcopy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a procedure where a microscope is used to check for abnormal cells in the vagina\na cystoscopy\u00a0\u2013 an examination of the inside of the bladder using a thin, hollow\u00a0tube\u00a0inserted into the bladder\na proctoscopy \u2013 an examination of the inside of the rectum\nbiopsies of the lymph nodes near your vulva\u00a0to\u00a0check whether cancer has spread through your lymphatic system\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan\u00a0\u2013 scans to check for signs of cancer in your lymph nodes or other organs\nan X-ray\u00a0to check that cancer has not spread to your lungs\n\nThe results of these tests will allow your doctor to 'stage' your cancer. This means using a number system to indicate how far the cancer has spread.\nStaging\nVulval cancers are staged using a number from 1 to 4. The lower the stage, the less the cancer has spread and the greater the chance of treatment being successful.\nThe staging system for vulval cancer is:\n\nstage 1 \u2013 the cancer is confined to the vulva\nstage 2 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread to other nearby parts of the body, such as the lower vagina, anus or lower urethra (the tube urine passes through\u00a0out of the body), but the lymph nodes are unaffected\nstage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes\nstage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread\u00a0to other parts of the body, including more distant lymph nodes\n\nStage 1 and 2 vulval cancers are generally regarded as early-stage cancers with a relatively good chance of being treated successfully. Stage 3 and 4 cancers are usually regarded as advanced-stage cancers and a complete cure for these types of cancers may not always be possible.\n\n\nTreatment for vulval cancer depends on factors such as how far the cancer has spread, your general health, and personal wishes.\nThe main\u00a0options are surgery,\u00a0radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Many women and anyone with a vulva with vulval cancer have a combination of these treatments.\nIf your cancer is at an early stage, it's often possible to get rid of it completely.\u00a0However, this may not be possible if the cancer has spread.\nEven after successful treatment, there is up to a 1\u00a0in 3\u00a0chance of the cancer returning at some point later on, so you'll need regular follow-up appointments to check for this.\nYour treatment plan\nMost hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat vulval cancer. MDTs are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment.\nMembers of your MDT will probably include a specialist surgeon, a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer (clinical oncologist) and a specialist cancer nurse.\nDeciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours.\nBefore visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments.\nSurgery to remove vulval cancer\nIn most cases, your treatment plan will involve some form of surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the stage of the cancer.\nThere are 3\u00a0surgical options to treat vulval cancer:\n\nradical wide local excision \u2013\u00a0the cancerous tissue from your vulva is removed, as a well as a margin of healthy tissue, usually at least\u00a01cm wide, as a precaution\nradical partial vulvectomy \u2013 a larger section\u00a0of\u00a0your vulva is removed, such as 1 or both of the labia and the clitoris\nradical vulvectomy \u2013 the\u00a0whole vulva is removed, including the inner and outer labia, and possibly the clitoris\n\nThe time it will take you to recover from surgery will depend on the type of surgery and how extensive it was. For extensive operations, such as a pelvic exenteration, it may be many weeks or months\u00a0before you start to\u00a0feel better.\nYour surgeon will talk to you about the possible risks associated with the type of procedure you're having. Possible risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, altered sensation in your vulva, and problems having sex.\nAssessing and removing groin lymph nodes\nAn additional operation may also be required to assess whether the cancerous cells have spread into one or more lymph nodes in your groin, and remove these if they're found to contain cancer.\u00a0\nIf the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, it's sometimes possible to only remove certain lymph nodes, known as\u00a0sentinel nodes.\nSentinel\u00a0nodes are identified by injecting a dye at the site of the tumour and studying\u00a0its flow\u00a0to locate the nodes closest to the tumour. These are then removed and checked for cancerous cells.\nIn some cases, some or all of the nodes in your groin\u00a0may need to be surgically removed. This is called a groin or\u00a0inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Further treatment with radiotherapy may also be\u00a0recommended.\nRemoving cancerous lymph nodes\u00a0reduces the risk of the cancer returning, but it can make you more vulnerable to infection and cause swelling in your legs from a build-up of lymphatic fluid (lymphoedema).\nIn cases of advanced vulval cancer or where the cancer returns after previous treatment, an operation called a pelvic exenteration may be recommended. This involves removing your entire vulva as well as your bladder, womb and part of your bowel. This is a major operation and isn't carried out very often these days.\nIf a section of your bowel is removed, it will be necessary for your surgeon to divert your bowel through\u00a0an opening made in your tummy (a stoma). Stools then pass along this piece of bowel and into a bag you wear over the stoma. This is known as\u00a0a colostomy.\nIf your bladder is removed, urine can be passed out of your body into a pouch via a stoma. This is\u00a0known as a urostomy. Alternatively,\u00a0it may be possible to create a new bladder by removing a section of your bowel and using it to create a pouch to store urine in.\nReconstructive surgery\nIf only a small amount of tissue has been removed during surgery, the skin of the vulva\u00a0can often be neatly stitched together.\nOtherwise, it may be necessary to reconstruct the vulva using a\u00a0skin graft,\u00a0where a piece of skin is taken from your thigh or\u00a0tummy and moved to\u00a0the wound in your\u00a0vulva. Another option is to have a\u00a0skin flap, where\u00a0an\u00a0area of skin near the vulva is used to create a flap and\u00a0cover the wound.\nThese reconstructive procedures are usually carried out at the same time as the operation to remove the cancer.\nRadiotherapy\nRadiotherapy involves using high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. There are several ways it\u00a0can be used to treat vulval cancer:\n\nbefore surgery to\u00a0try\u00a0to\u00a0shrink a large cancer\u00a0\u2013 this is to\u00a0help make the operation possible without removing nearby organs\nafter surgery\u00a0to destroy any cancerous cells that may be left\u00a0\u2013 for example, for cases where cancer cells\u00a0have spread to the lymph nodes in the groin\nas an alternative to surgery, if you're not well enough to have an operation\nto relieve symptoms in cases where a complete cure is not possible \u2013 this is known as palliative radiotherapy\n\nIn most cases, you'll have external radiotherapy, where a machine directs beams of radiation\u00a0on to the section of the body that contains the cancer.\nThis\u00a0is normally given in daily sessions, 5\u00a0days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes.\u00a0The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks.\nWhile radiation is effective in killing cancerous cells, it can also damage healthy tissues. This can\u00a0lead to a number of side effects, such as:\n\nsore skin around the vulva area\ndiarrhoea\u00a0\nfeeling tired all the time\nloss of pubic hair, which may be permanent\nswelling of the vulva\nnarrowing of your vagina, which can make sex difficult\ninflammation of your bladder (cystitis)\n\nIn younger people, external radiotherapy can sometimes trigger an early menopause.\u00a0This means they\u00a0will no longer be able to have any children.\nRead more about the side effects of radiotherapy.\nChemotherapy\nChemotherapy is where medication is used to kill cancer cells. It's usually given by injection.\nIt's usually used if vulval cancer comes back or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible. Sometimes it may be combined with radiotherapy.\nThe medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue, as well as the cancerous tissue. Side effects are common and include:\n\ntiredness\nfeeling and being\u00a0sick\nhair thinning or\u00a0hair\u00a0loss\nsore mouth and mouth ulcers\u00a0\nan increased risk of infections \u2013 tell your care team if you develop any symptoms of an infection, and try to avoid close contact with people known to have an infection\n\nThese side effects should pass once treatment has finished.\nRead more about the side effects of chemotherapy.\u00a0\nEmotional support\nThe emotional impact of living with vulval cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a kind of rollercoaster effect. You may feel down at receiving a diagnosis, feel up when the cancer has been removed from your body, and then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of surgery.\nSome people experience feelings of\u00a0depression. If you think you may be depressed, contact your GP or care team for advice. There are a range of treatments that can help.\nYou may also find it useful to contact one of the main cancer charities, such as:\n\nMacmillan Cancer Support\u00a0\u2013 the helpline\u00a0is available\u00a0on 0808 808 00 00, Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm\nCancer Research UK\u00a0\u2013 a cancer nurse helpline is available\u00a0on 0808 800 4040, Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": "Warts are small lumps that often develop on the skin of the hands and feet.\nWarts vary in appearance and may develop singly or in clusters. Some are more likely to affect particular areas of the body. For example,\u00a0verrucas are warts that usually develop\u00a0on the soles of the feet.\nWarts are non-cancerous, but can resemble certain cancers.\nMost people will have\u00a0warts at some point in their life. They tend to affect children and teenagers more\u00a0than adults.\nRead more about the symptoms of warts.\nWhat causes warts?\nWarts are caused by an\u00a0infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV).\nThe virus causes an excess amount of keratin, a hard protein, to develop\u00a0in the top skin layer (epidermis). The extra keratin\u00a0produces the rough, hard texture of a wart.\nRead more about the causes of warts.\nAre warts contagious?\nWarts aren't considered very\u00a0contagious,\u00a0but they can be caught by\u00a0close skin-to-skin contact. The infection can also be transmitted indirectly from contaminated objects or surfaces, such as the\u00a0area surrounding a swimming pool.\nYou are more likely to get infected if your skin is wet or damaged. After you become infected, it can take weeks or even months for a wart or verruca to appear.\nWhen to get professional advice\nIf you have warts or verrucas you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory.\nWarts and verrucas aren't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you see your GP if required.\nMost types of\u00a0warts are easy to\u00a0identify because they have a\u00a0distinctive appearance. You should always see your pharmacist first if you have a growth on your skin you are unable to identify or are worried about.\nYour pharmacist will be able to tell if it's a wart simply by looking at it. Where it is on your body and how it affects surrounding skin will also be taken into consideration.\nSometimes your pharmacist will advise you to see your GP about a wart.\nTreating warts\nMost warts are harmless and clear up without treatment.\nThe length of time\u00a0it takes a wart to disappear will vary from person to person. It may\u00a0take up to 2\u00a0years for the viral infection\u00a0to leave your system and for\u00a0the wart to disappear.\nYou might decide to\u00a0treat your wart if it is painful, or in an area that is causing discomfort or embarrassment.\nCommon methods of treatment include:\n\nsalicylic acid\ncryotherapy (freezing the skin cells)\nchemical treatments\n\nTreatment for warts is\u00a0not always completely effective, and a wart will\u00a0sometimes\u00a0return following treatment.\nSurgery is not usually recommended for warts.\nRead more about how warts are treated.\n\n\nWarts are not usually painful, but some types, such as verrucas, may hurt. They can occasionally itch or bleed.\nThere are several different types of warts, all varying in size and shape.\nCommon warts (verruca vulgaris)\nIf you have a common wart, it will:\n\nbe round or oval-shaped\nbe firm and raised\nhave a rough, irregular surface similar to a cauliflower\noften develop on the knuckles, fingers and knees\nvary in size, from less than 1mm to more than 10mm (1cm) in diameter\n\nYou may\u00a0develop one common wart or several.\nVerrucas (plantar warts)\nVerrucas usually develop on the soles of the feet. The affected area of skin will:\n\nbe white, often with a black dot\u00a0(blood vessel) in the centre\nbe flat rather than\u00a0raised\nsometimes be painful if they are\u00a0on a weight-bearing\u00a0part of the foot\u00a0\n\nMosaic warts\nMosaic warts grow in clusters and form a \"tile-like\" pattern. They often develop on the palms of the hands and\u00a0soles of the feet.\nPeriungual warts\nPeriungual warts develop\u00a0under and around the fingernails\u00a0or toenails. They:\n\nhave a rough surface\ncan affect the shape of the nail\ncan be painful\n\nFiliform warts (verruca filiformis)\nFiliform warts are long and slender in appearance, often developing on the neck\u00a0or\u00a0face.\nPlane warts\nIt is possible to have between one and several hundred plane warts, which can develop in clusters. They\u00a0are usually:\n\na\u00a0yellowish colour\nsmooth, round and flat-topped\n2-4mm in diameter\u00a0\ncommon in young children \u2013 mainly affecting\u00a0the hands, face and legs\n\nPlane warts can sometimes develop on the lower legs of\u00a0women, as the human papilloma virus (HPV) can be spread through shaving.\u00a0\n\n\nWarts are caused by certain strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV). The virus is present in the skin cells of a wart.\nHPV is a family of viruses that affects the skin and moist membranes (mucosa) of the body.\nThere are more than 100 different strains of HPV. Different strains are responsible for different types of warts.\nHow HPV is spread\nHPV is passed on through close skin-to-skin contact. It can also be transmitted\u00a0indirectly by contact\u00a0with contaminated objects, such as towels, shoes,\u00a0areas surrounding swimming pools, or\u00a0the floors of\u00a0communal changing\u00a0areas.\nWarts are thought to be contagious for as long as they are present on your body. The virus\u00a0is\u00a0more likely to spread\u00a0if\u00a0the skin is wet, soft or has been in contact with a rough surface.\nWarts can also be spread to other parts of your own body. You can spread the virus if you:\n\nscratch, knock or bite a wart\nbite your nails or suck your fingers (if they have warts on them)\nshave your face or legs\n\nThis can cause the wart to break up and bleed, making it easier for the virus to spread. You are more vulnerable to verrucas\u00a0if you have scratches or cuts on the soles of your\u00a0feet.\n\n\nWarts usually clear up without treatment. However, it can take up to 2\u00a0years for the virus to leave your system and the warts to disappear.\nThe length of time it takes for a wart to disappear will vary from person to person. They tend to last longer in older children and adults.\nIn adults and people with a weakened immune system, warts\u00a0are less likely to clear up on their own or respond well to treatment.\nLeaving the wart to go away by itself is one\u00a0option. However, you may want to consider treatment if your wart is painful, in an awkward\u00a0position, or\u00a0is causing you distress or embarrassment.\nYour GP should always refer you to a specialist if you need treatment for a wart on your face.\nHow to treat warts and verrucas\nThere are a number of treatments available\u00a0for warts. However, no single treatment is 100% effective, and the wart may\u00a0return.\nThe aim of treatment is to remove the wart without it returning and without leaving any scarring.\nTreatments include:\n\nsalicylic acid\ncryotherapy\nchemical treatments\n\nSurgery to treat warts is not usually recommended because\u00a0they often\u00a0return and further treatment is required.\nSome treatments may cause side effects such as mild pain, blistering and skin irritation around the wart.\nMany wart and verruca treatments are available over the counter from pharmacies, including:\n\ncreams\ngels\npaints\nmedicated plasters\n\nSalicylic acid is the active ingredient in most of these treatments.\u00a0It has been shown that salicylic acid is as effective as\u00a0cryotherapy\u00a0for treating warts.\u00a0\nThere is limited evidence available to show which type of salicylic acid treatment\u00a0(cream, gel, paint or plasters) is most effective.\nSalicylic acid and other wart treatments also destroy healthy skin, so it is important to protect your skin before applying the treatment. You can use petroleum jelly or a corn plaster to cover the skin around the wart.\nBefore applying the treatment to your wart, use an emery board or\u00a0pumice stone to file it down a little (avoid sharing the board or pumice stone\u00a0with others). Repeat this about once a week while you are treating your warts.\nEach time\u00a0you\u00a0treat your wart, soak it in water for about 5\u00a0minutes\u00a0first to soften it, then\u00a0follow the instructions that come with the medication.\nYou may need to apply the treatment every day for 12 weeks or longer. You should\u00a0stop the\u00a0treatment if your skin becomes sore, and seek advice from your pharmacist.\nConsult your pharmacist before using over-the-counter treatments that contain salicylic acid if you have poor circulation \u2013 for example, if you have a condition like diabetes or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This is because there is an increased risk of damage to your skin, nerves and tendons.\nIn cryotherapy, liquid nitrogen is applied to your wart for a few seconds to freeze and destroy the affected skin\u00a0cells. After treatment, a\u00a0sore blister will form, followed by a scab, which will\u00a0fall off 7-10\u00a0days later.\nA session of cryotherapy usually takes 5-15 minutes and can be painful. Large warts usually need to be frozen a few times before they clear up. You will probably need to wait a few weeks between each treatment.\nThere are 2\u00a0different cryotherapy methods. Liquid nitrogen may be sprayed directly onto the wart, or it may be applied using a stick with cotton wool on the tip. This second\u00a0method\u00a0is often\u00a0preferred for treatment around the eyes or for small children.\nCryotherapy may be recommended if you have a wart on your face. This is because the risk of irritation is lower than when using salicylic acid or duct tape.\nCryotherapy is not usually recommended to treat young children because they may find the treatment too painful. It may also be difficult for them to stay in the same position while having the treatment.\nIf cryotherapy hasn't been successful within 3\u00a0months, further treatments aren't likely to be effective.\nPossible side effects of cryotherapy include:\n\npain and blistering\nyour skin may become darker (hyperpigmentation) or lighter (hypopigmentation) \u2013 particularly if you have black skin\nyour nails may develop an abnormal change in shape or structure if cryotherapy is used to treat warts that develop\u00a0around the nails (periungual warts)\n\nCryotherapy\u00a0is sometimes carried out\u00a0at GP surgeries or at hospital skincare clinics. However,\u00a0it may not\u00a0be\u00a0available on the NHS in all areas of the country.\nA very cold spray (dimethyl ether propane) is also available from pharmacies, which you can apply yourself. You should avoid using this spray on your face. Evidence suggests these sprays are not as effective as cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen.\nWarts can also be treated using chemical treatments available on prescription.\u00a0The treatments contain chemicals such as:\n\nformaldehyde\u00a0\nglutaraldehyde\u00a0\nsilver nitrate\n\nThese chemicals are\u00a0applied to\u00a0the warts to kill\u00a0affected skin cells. Potential side effects include the skin being stained brown (with glutaraldehyde) and burns to the surrounding skin (with silver nitrate).\u00a0\nOther Treatments\nIf the above treatments do not clear warts then other methods may be tried such as:\n\nlight therapy (photodynamic therapy)\nlaser therapy\nacupuncture (for flat warts only)\n\nThese treatments\u00a0may not be available on the NHS.\nTreating warts during pregnancy\nIf you are pregnant and\u00a0have warts, your pharmacist may recommend using salicylic acid, cryotherapy or duct tape.\nSalicylic acid can be used to treat warts during pregnancy, as long as it is used on a small area for a limited period of time.\n\n\nMost people will be infected by the human papilloma virus (HPV) at some point in their life and develop warts.\nHowever, there are steps you can take to lower your chances of getting warts and prevent spreading them to others, if you have them.\nIf you have\u00a0a wart or verruca, you should cover it\u00a0up when taking part in communal activities. For example, you should:\n\nwear pool slippers or\u00a0flip flops\u00a0in communal changing rooms and\u00a0showers\u00a0\ncover your wart or verruca with a waterproof plaster or a\u00a0verruca sock when you go swimming, or while doing physical education at school\nwear gloves when using shared gym equipment if you have a wart on your hand\n\n\n\n"}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": ""}}, {"data": {"text": "Cancer of the womb (uterus) is a common cancer that affects the female reproductive system.

Specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body.\nA number of\u00a0things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, and\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\u00a0There is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen.\nIt's not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of contraception.\nRead more about the causes of womb cancer\nHow is womb cancer treated?\nThe most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy).\nA hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but\u00a0you\u00a0will no longer be able to get pregnant.\u00a0Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.\nRadiotherapy or\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0are also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery.\nA type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children.\nEven if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life.\nRead more about treating womb cancer\nLiving with womb cancer\nLiving with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways.\nFor example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. You may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive.\nYou may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer.\nRead more about living with womb cancer\nWho is affected?\nWomb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. It's the fourth most common cancer diagnosed\u00a0in women after breast cancer, lung cancer, and cancer of the colon and rectum.\nWomb cancer is more common in women and anyone with a womb who has been through the menopause. Most cases are diagnosed in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.\n\n\nThe most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don't have cancer.\nBleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the menopause, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual.\nIn women and anyone with a womb who hasn't been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of:\n\nperiods that are heavier than usual\nvaginal bleeding in between normal periods\n\nLess common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex.\nIf womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. These include:\n\npain in the back, legs, or pelvis\nloss of appetite\ntiredness\nnausea\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\nIf you have\u00a0postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your GP.\nOnly\u00a01 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by\u00a0womb cancer, so it's unlikely your symptoms\u00a0will be caused by this condition.\nHowever, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it's important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated.\u00a0The bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as:\n\nendometriosis\u00a0\u2013 where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb\nfibroids\u00a0\u2013 non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus\npolyps in the womb lining\n\nOther types of gynaecological cancer can also\u00a0cause unusual\u00a0vaginal bleeding, particularly cervical cancer.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: womb cancer symptoms\nMacmillan: symptoms of womb cancer\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt's not known exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing it.\nCancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour.\nIf left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system.\nIncreased risk\nA number of things have been identified that\u00a0increase the risk of developing\u00a0womb cancer.\u00a0\nThe risk of developing\u00a0womb cancer increases with age. The majority of cases\u00a0occur in women and anyone with a womb aged 40 to 74.\nThe risk of developing womb cancer is linked to the body's\u00a0exposure to oestrogen. Oestrogen is one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system.\n\noestrogen stimulates the release of eggs from your ovaries and causes the cells of the\u00a0womb lining to divide\nprogesterone gets the lining of your uterus ready to receive the egg from the ovaries\n\nThe levels of oestrogen and progesterone in your body are usually balanced with each other. If oestrogen isn't kept in balance by progesterone, the level in the body can increase. This is called unopposed oestrogen.\nAfter the menopause, the body stops producing progesterone. However, there are still small amounts of oestrogen being produced. This unopposed oestrogen causes the cells of the endometrium to divide, which\u00a0can increase the risk of\u00a0womb cancer.\nBecause of the link between increased levels of unopposed oestrogen and\u00a0womb cancer, oestrogen-only\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should only be given to those who have had their womb surgically removed (hysterectomy).\nIn all other cases, both oestrogen and progesterone (combination HRT) must be used in HRT to reduce the risk of womb cancer.\nAs oestrogen can be produced in fatty tissue, being overweight or obese\u00a0increases the level of oestrogen in your body. This significantly increases your chances of developing womb cancer.\nWomen and anyone with a womb who is overweight is 3\u00a0times more likely to develop womb cancer compared with those who are a healthy weight.\u00a0\nOne way to assess whether your weight is healthy is to understand\u00a0your healthy body mass index (BMI).\u00a0\nWomen and anyone with a womb who has not had children are at a higher risk of\u00a0womb cancer. This may be because the increased levels of progesterone and decreased levels of oestrogen that occur during pregnancy\u00a0have a protective effect on the lining of the womb.\nWomen and anyone with a womb who are treated with tamoxifen (a hormone treatment for breast cancer) can be at an increased risk of developing womb cancer. However, this risk is outweighed by the benefits that tamoxifen provides in preventing breast cancer.\nIt's important to visit your GP if you're taking tamoxifen and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding.\nWomen and anyone with a womb with\u00a0diabetes\u00a0are twice as likely to develop womb cancer as those without the condition.\nDiabetes causes an increase in the amount of insulin in your body, which in turn can raise your oestrogen levels.\nMany women and anyone with ovaries with type 2 diabetes are also overweight, which further increases the risk.\nWomen and anyone with ovaries with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are at a higher risk of developing womb cancer, as they have high levels of oestrogen in their bodies.\nPCOS can cause symptoms such as irregular or light periods, or no periods at all, as well as\u00a0problems getting pregnant, weight gain, acne, and excessive hair growth (hirsutism).\nEndometrial hyperplasia is when the lining of the womb becomes thicker. It\u00a0may be increase risk of developing\u00a0womb cancer.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: womb cancer risks and causes\nMacmillan: causes of womb cancer\n\n\n\nYou should visit your GP if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. While it's unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it's best to be sure.\nYour GP will probably carry out a physical examination of your pelvic area, including your vagina, womb, ovaries, and bladder. They will ask about your symptoms, when they happen, and how often.\nYou may be referred to a specialist in conditions of the female reproductive organs (a gynaecologist) for further tests.\nIn 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected endometrial cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral.\nTransvaginal ultrasound (TVU)\nAnother test you may have is called a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU). TVU is a type of\u00a0ultrasound scan that uses a small scanner in the form of a probe.\nThis is placed directly into the vagina to obtain a detailed picture of the inside of the uterus. The probe can feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful.\nThe TVU checks whether there are any changes to the thickness of the lining of your uterus that could be caused by the presence of cancerous cells.\nBiopsy\nIf the results of the TVU detect changes in the thickness of the lining of the uterus, you will usually have a\u00a0biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\nIn\u00a0a biopsy, a small sample of cells is taken from the lining of the womb (the endometrium). The sample is then checked at a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells.\nThe biopsy can be carried out in\u00a0several ways, including:\n\naspiration biopsy \u2013 a small flexible tube is inserted into your vagina and up into your womb, and then sucks up a small sample of cells\nhysteroscopy \u2013 this allows the doctor to look at the inside of the womb using a thin type of telescope called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through your vagina and into your womb, allowing the doctor to look at the lining of the womb and take a sample from it\n\nIn some cases, a hysteroscopy\u00a0may be used before dilatation and curettage (D&C). D&C is a minor surgical procedure\u00a0carried out under general anaesthetic,\u00a0where some tissue from the womb lining is removed. The tissue\u00a0is then sent off to a laboratory for further testing.\nBlood test\nA blood test can sometimes help diagnose womb cancer. This is because some cancerous tumours release certain chemicals into your blood, known as tumour markers, which can be detected during a blood test.\nHowever, this type of test isn't very reliable. The presence of these chemicals doesn't mean you definitely have womb cancer. Some people with womb cancer don't have these chemicals in their blood.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: womb cancer tests\nMacmillan: how womb cancer is diagnosed\n\nTests if you have\u00a0womb cancer\nIf you're diagnosed with womb cancer, you may have further tests\u00a0to help determine the stage of the cancer. Staging the cancer will allow the doctors to work out how large the cancer is, whether or not it has spread, and the best treatment options for you.\nThese tests may include:\n\na\u00a0chest X-ray\u00a0\u2013 where radiation is used to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\u00a0\u2013 where magnetic fields are used to create a\u00a0detailed image of the inside of your body\u00a0to check if the cancer has spread\na computerised tomography (CT) scan\u00a0\u2013 where a series of X-rays are used to create a detailed image of the inside of your body\u00a0to check if the cancer has spread\nfurther blood tests \u2013\u00a0these are usually done\u00a0to check your general health and how well some of your organs are functioning\n\nRead treating womb cancer for more information about staging.\n\n\nHealth professionals use a staging system to describe how far womb cancer has advanced. These stages are:\n\nstage 1 \u2013\u00a0the cancer is still contained inside the womb (uterus)\nstage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread to the neck of the womb (the cervix)\nstage 3 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread outside the womb into nearby tissues in the pelvis or the lymph nodes\nstage 4 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread to the soft tissues of the abdomen, or into other organs, such as the bladder, bowel, liver, or lungs\n\nYour chances of surviving womb cancer depend on the stage at which it's diagnosed.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: stages of womb cancer\nCancer Research UK: statistics and outlook for womb cancer\n\nTreatment overview\nThe main treatment for womb cancer is to remove the womb (hysterectomy), together with the ovaries and fallopian tubes. This is sometimes followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy\u00a0to try to kill any possible remaining cancer cells, depending on the stage and grade of the cancer.\nTreatment if you haven't been through the menopause\nHaving a hysterectomy means you will\u00a0no longer be\u00a0able to get pregnant. Younger women who haven't already reached the menopause may not want to have their womb and ovaries removed if they wish to have children.\nIn this case, under very specific circumstances it may be possible to treat the cancer using hormone therapy.\nTreating advanced cancer\nAdvanced womb cancer\u00a0requires a different course of treatment, usually depending more on chemotherapy.\nAdvanced cancer may not be curable, but the treatment aims to achieve a remission, where the cancer shrinks, making you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full.\nEven if there's no chance of a cure, surgery may be carried out to remove as much of the cancer as possible.\nRadiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy can reduce symptoms such as pain by shrinking the cancer or slowing its growth.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: controlling symptoms of advanced womb cancer\nCancer Research UK: which treatment for womb cancer?\n\nSurgery\nIf you have stage\u00a01 cancer, you'll probably have a hysterectomy. This involves removing both ovaries and the fallopian tubes in a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), as well as\u00a0the uterus (hysterectomy).\nThe surgeon may also take samples from the lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen and other nearby tissue. These will be sent to the laboratory to see whether the cancer has spread.\nThe most common hysterectomy technique involves using one large cut across your tummy to access the womb and remove it.\nIt's sometimes possible to use a technique called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, also known as a\u00a0keyhole hysterectomy. This involves using several small cuts so a special type of telescope (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments\u00a0can be used.\nThis\u00a0means the surgeon\u00a0can see inside your body and remove your womb through your vagina with little scarring.\nYou'll probably be ready to go home 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0days after your operation, or less if you had keyhole surgery. But it can take many weeks to recover fully.\nAfter your operation, you'll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. This is very important, and even if you have to stay in bed you'll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots. You'll be shown exercises by the nurses or physiotherapist to help prevent complications.\nWhen you go home, you'll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Discuss with your doctor or physiotherapist which types of exercise would be suitable for you.\nIf you have stage\u00a02 or\u00a03 womb cancer and the cancer has spread to the cervix or nearby lymph nodes in the pelvis, you may have a radical or total hysterectomy.\nThis involves the additional removal of the cervix and the top of your vagina, as well as the removal of the pelvic lymph nodes. You may also need radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment after surgery to reduce the risk\u00a0of the cancer returning.\nIf you have advanced womb cancer, you may have surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. This is called debulking surgery.\nThis won't cure the cancer, but it may ease some of the symptoms. Your doctor will discuss whether debulking surgery is suitable for you.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: having your operation for womb cancer\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer\n\nRadiotherapy\nA course of\u00a0radiotherapy will be recommended if your treatment team thinks there's a significant risk the cancer could return in the pelvis. Radiotherapy may also be used to slow the spread of cancer when a surgical cure is not possible.\nThere are 2\u00a0types of radiotherapy used to treat\u00a0womb cancer:\n\ninternal radiotherapy (also known as brachytherapy)\u00a0\u2013 where\u00a0a plastic tube is inserted inside the uterus and radiation treatment is passed down the tube into the womb\nexternal radiotherapy \u2013\u00a0where\u00a0a machine is used to deliver pulses of radiation to your pelvis\n\nA course of external radiotherapy is usually given to you as an outpatient for 5\u00a0days a week with a break at the weekend. The treatment takes a few minutes. The whole course of radiotherapy may last approximately 4\u00a0weeks depending on the stage and position of the womb cancer.\nSome women and anyone with a womb have internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) as well as external radiotherapy. During brachytherapy, the device that delivers radiation is placed in your vagina.\nThere are different types of brachytherapy, involving either low, medium, or high dose rates. With low dose rate methods the radiation is delivered more slowly, so the device has to stay inside you for longer. You'll have to stay in hospital while you have the treatment. Your doctor will discuss this with you.\nRadiotherapy has some side effects. Skin in the treated area can become red and sore, and hair loss may occur. Radiotherapy to the pelvic area can affect the bowel and cause sickness and diarrhoea.\nAs your course of treatment progresses, you're likely to get very tired. Most of these side effects will go away when your treatment finishes.\nChemotherapy\nIf you have stage\u00a03 or\u00a04\u00a0womb cancer, you may be given a course of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can be used after surgery to try to prevent the return of the cancer. In cases of advanced cancer, it may be used to slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms.\nChemotherapy is usually given as an injection into the vein (intravenously). You'll usually be able to go home the same day you have chemotherapy, but sometimes you may need a short stay in hospital.\nChemotherapy is usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment being followed by a period of rest to allow the body to recover.\nSide effects of chemotherapy can include:\n\nnausea\nvomiting\nhair loss\u00a0\nfatigue\n\nThere is also an increased risk of an infection developing in your bloodstream (sepsis), as your body's ability to fight infection is reduced by chemotherapy.\nThe side effects should stop once treatment has finished.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: chemotherapy for womb cancer\nMacmillan: chemotherapy for womb cancer\n\nHormone therapy\nSome\u00a0womb cancers are affected by the female hormone oestrogen. These cancers may respond to treatment with hormone therapy. Your doctor will discuss\u00a0whether this is a possible treatment for your\u00a0womb cancer.\nHormone therapy\u00a0usually\u00a0replaces\u00a0a hormone called progesterone, which naturally occurs in your body. Artificial progesterone is used and is\u00a0usually given as tablets.\nIt's mainly used to treat advanced-stage\u00a0womb cancers, or cancer that has come back, and can help shrink the tumour and control any symptoms.\nThe treatment may have some side effects, including mild nausea, mild muscle cramps, and weight gain. Your doctor will discuss these with you.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: hormone therapy for womb cancer\nMacmillan: hormonal treatment for womb cancer\n\nClinical trials\nA lot of progress has been made in the treatment of womb cancer. More people are living longer with fewer side effects. Some of these advances were discovered through clinical trials,\u00a0where new treatments and combinations of treatments are compared with standard treatment.\nAll cancer clinical trials in the UK are carefully monitored to make sure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials often do better overall than those in routine care.\nIf you're invited to take part in a trial, you'll be given an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you'll be asked to sign your consent. You're always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: trials and research\nCancer Research UK: womb cancer research\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWomen and anyone with a womb with womb cancer usually have a hysterectomy. This can be a major operation, and recovery may take\u00a0from\u00a06 to 12 weeks.\nDuring this time you will have to avoid lifting things (for example, children and heavy shopping bags) and doing heavy housework. You won't be able to drive for between 3\u00a0and 8\u00a0weeks after the operation.\nMost people need\u00a04 to\u00a012 weeks off work after a hysterectomy. The recovery time will depend on the type of surgery you have, whether or not\u00a0any problems develop, and what type of work you will return to.\nSome of the treatments for endometrial cancer, particularly radiotherapy, can make you very tired. You may need to take a break from some of your normal activities for a while. Don't be afraid to ask for practical help from family and friends if you need it.\nFollow-up\nAfter your course of treatment has finished, you'll probably be invited back for regular check-ups. At the check-up, your doctor will examine you (this is likely to include an internal examination) and possibly carry out blood tests or scans to see how your cancer is responding to treatment.\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan: follow-up after treatment for womb cancer\n\nRelationships and sex\nKnowing how to talk to your friends and family about your cancer can be difficult, and they may find it hard to talk to you, too. People deal with serious problems in different ways.\nIt's hard to predict how a diagnosis of cancer will affect you. Being open and honest about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help\u00a0may put them at ease. But don't feel shy about telling people that you want some time to yourself, if that's what you need.\nRead further information:\n\nTalking to your kids about cancer\nMacmillan: the emotional effects of cancer\nMacmillan: telling your friends and family\n\nWomb\u00a0cancer and its treatment can affect your sex life. This can happen in several ways.\nIf you haven't already had the menopause, removing the ovaries means you'll go through an early menopause. Symptoms can include vaginal dryness and loss of sexual desire.\nRadiotherapy for endometrial cancer can make your vagina narrower and less flexible. Sometimes the vagina gets so narrow that having sex becomes difficult. To stop this happening, you should be offered a set of vaginal dilators, which are plastic cones you put into your vagina to stretch it. You can also stretch your vagina by having sex, or by using your fingers or a vibrator.\nIt's common to lose interest in sex after treatment for\u00a0womb cancer. Your treatment may leave you feeling very tired. You may feel shocked, confused or depressed about being diagnosed with cancer, and you also\u00a0may be grieving the loss of your fertility.\nIt's understandable that you may not feel like having sex while having to cope with all this. Try to share your feelings with your partner. If you feel you have problems with sex that aren't getting better with time, you may want to speak to a counsellor or a sex therapist.\nRead further information:\n\nMacmillan: how treatment for womb cancer may affect your sex life and\u00a0relationships\n\nTalk to others\nBeing diagnosed with cancer can be hard, both for patients and their families. You'll need to deal with the emotional and practical difficulties.\nWith\u00a0womb cancer, you have to cope physically with recovering from a hysterectomy, as well as\u00a0the possible emotional impact of losing your womb.\nYounger women may have to face the fact they won't be able to have children and all the grief and anger that may cause.\nOften, it can help to discuss your feelings and other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways\u00a0to find help and support:\n\nyour hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor\nif you're struggling with feelings of depression, talk to your GP\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a course of\u00a0antidepressant drugs may be helpful, or your GP can arrange for you to get help from a counsellor or psychotherapist\nit may be helpful to talk to someone who's had the same experience as you\u00a0\u2013 many organisations have telephone helplines and forums that may be useful to you, and they can put you in touch with other people who have been through cancer treatment\n\nRead further information:\n\nCancer Research UK: coping with cancer\u00a0\n\nMoney and financial support\nIf you have to reduce or stop work because of your cancer, you may find it hard to cope financially. If you have cancer or you are caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to financial support.\n\nif you have a job but can't work because of your illness, you're entitled to\u00a0Statutory Sick Pay from your employer\nif you don't have a job and can't work because of your illness, you may be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance\u00a0\nif you're caring for someone with cancer, you may be entitled to Carer's Allowance\u00a0\u00a0\nyou may be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home, or you have a low household income\n\nFind out what help is available to you\u00a0early on.
